Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies or other forms of free associations. As a historically left-wing movement, usually placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement.\\nHumans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers\\' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and anti-globalisation movements.\\nAnarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society.\\nEtymology, terminology, and definition.\\nThe etymological origin of \"anarchism\" is from the Ancient Greek \"anarkhia\", meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \"an-\" (\"without\") and the word \"arkhos\" (\"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix \"-ism\" denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. \"Anarchism\" appears in English from 1642 as \"anarchisme\" and \"anarchy\" from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as \"anarchists\", although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs.\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an \"anarchist\" () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. Some usages of \"libertarianism\" refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed \"libertarian anarchism\".\\nWhile the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups, including both the New Left and libertarian Marxists, who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party, and extreme cultural liberals, who are primarily concerned with civil liberties. Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism\\'s negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism. \"Anarchism\" is broadly used to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement. Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above. Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism\\'s socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two. Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism, and being both liberals and socialists but more so, while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.\\nWhile opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining \"anarchism\" is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.\\nHistory.\\nPre-modern era.\\nBefore the creation of towns and cities, established authority did not exist. It was after the institution of authority that anarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction. The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, philosophical anarchism (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuang Zhou and Laozi. Alongside Stoicism, Taoism has been said to have had \"significant anticipations\" of anarchism.\\nAnarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. Aeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. Cynics dismissed human law (\"nomos\") and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\"physis\"). Stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.\\nIn medieval Europe, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to religious anarchism. In the Sasanian Empire, Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, only to be soon executed by Emperor Kavad I.\\nIn Basra, religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Renewed interest in antiquity during the Renaissance and in private judgment during the Reformation restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism, particularly in France. Enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the revolutions of the 1790s and 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.\\nModern era.\\nDuring the French Revolution, partisan groups such as the Enragés and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments. The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England, morally delegitimising the state, Max Stirner\\'s thinking paved the way to individualism and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\\'s theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France. By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914. This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War and is considered the golden age of anarchism.\\nDrawing from mutualism, Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen\\'s Association, a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with Karl Marx being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin\\'s faction (the Jura Federation) and Proudhon\\'s followers (the mutualists) opposed state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress. Anarchists were treated similarly in the Second International, being ultimately expelled in 1896. Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx\\'s terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the St. Imier International. Under the influence of Peter Kropotkin, a Russian philosopher and scientist, anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism. Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune, advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one\\'s needs.\\nAt the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement. In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism. Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study. In Latin America, Argentina was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism, where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology. During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence. This strategy became known as propaganda of the deed. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many Communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts. Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration, including the Immigration Act of 1903, also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act. Illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.\\nDespite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution in opposition to the White movement; however, they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilised. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, notably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and the Makhnovist movement. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War, many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the General Confederation of Labour and the Industrial Workers of the World left their organisations and joined the Communist International.\\nIn the Spanish Civil War of 1936, anarchists and syndicalists (CNT and FAI) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they collectivised the land. The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans.\\nPost-war era.\\nBy the end of World War II, the anarchist movement had been severely weakened. The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War. During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti-nuclear, environmental, and peace movements, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the New Left. It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti-capitalist reformism. Anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism. Black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism\\'s move from a Eurocentric demographic. This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.\\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. During the protests, \"ad hoc\" leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with the police. Other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups, security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the 1999 Seattle WTO conference. Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as Rojava, a \"de facto\" autonomous region in northern Syria.\\nWhile having revolutionary aspirations, many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays. Instead, they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization, based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation. Scholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of Food not Bombs group of collectives, to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work: direct action, working together and in solidarity with those left behind. While doing so, they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policies to tackle hunger, raging from de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents, helping farmers and commodification of food and housing. Honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans, but non-humans and the environment as well. Honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only can not solve those pressing problems for humanity, but are causal factors as well, resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole.\\nThought.\\nAnarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, social anarchism and individualist anarchism, owing to their different origins, values and evolution. The individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership. In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents (anarcha-feminism, green anarchism, and post-anarchism) developed thereafter.\\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy. Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy. Anarchism\\'s emphasis on anti-capitalism, egalitarianism, and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism.\\nAnarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum. Much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian, anti-statist, libertarian, and radical interpretations of left-wing and socialist politics such as collectivism, communism, individualism, mutualism, and syndicalism, among other libertarian socialist economic theories. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives, a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. Belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists. Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.\\nClassical.\\nInceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism (collectivist, communist and syndicalist). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.\\nMutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people. Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. In \"What Is Property?\" (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.\" Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin. Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.\\nAnarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations, workers\\' councils and worker cooperatives, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\" Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin, whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are direct action, workers\\' solidarity and workers\\' self-management.\\nIndividualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants. Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin, Max Stirner, and Henry David Thoreau. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation.\\nPost-classical and contemporary.\\nAnarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation movement, whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.\\nContemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism\\'s historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory. Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement. While theorists and activists have established \"relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles\", there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple \"anarchisms\", rather than a singular \"anarchism\", in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.\\nAnarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism.\" Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed. The principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.\\nTactics.\\nAnarchists\\' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely to first oppose the Establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends. A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other. Evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence, reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.\\nAnarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.\\nClassical era.\\nDuring the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in revolutions. Many anarchists, especially the Galleanists, believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state. Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s. Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.\\nAnarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial. Anarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends. Other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible. Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta, who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil.\\nAnarchists took an active role in strike actions, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism, seeing it as reformist. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism. Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced naturism and nudism. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media.\\nRevolutionary.\\nIn the current era, Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno, a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism, has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.\\nOverall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as Canada, Greece, and Mexico. Militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police; however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking anti-fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.\\nEvolutionary.\\nAnarchists commonly employ direct action. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives. Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as horizontalism. Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the \"big-A anarchism\" of the classical era, the newly coined term \"small-a anarchism\" signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.\\nThe decision-making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role. Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.\\nAs in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone online in the World Wide Web to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals. Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users\\' privacy from state surveillance.\\nAnarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal. As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action. Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds. Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.\\nKey issues.\\nAs anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory. The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism, collectivism, Marxism, and trade unionism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism, or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as civilisation, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.\\nThe state.\\nObjection to the state and its institutions is a \"sine qua non\" of anarchism. Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is open or transparent, as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society.\\nSpecific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. Robert Paul Wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning \"coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.\" A. John Simmons and Leslie Green, who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely. Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.\\nGender, sexuality, and free love.\\nAs gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one\\'s autonomy imposed by gender roles.\\nSexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing. Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker, who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men. A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism. Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women\\'s sexual freedom and pleasure. Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together. Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love. Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another.\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism, radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents. With the third wave of feminism, sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality. Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.\\nEducation.\\nThe interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of mutual aid. Anarchist writers such as William Godwin (\"Political Justice\") and Max Stirner (\"The False Principle of Our Education\") attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.\\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela Moderna in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church. Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world. Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy, who published the essay \"Education and Culture\", also established a similar school with its founding principle being that \"for education to be effective it had to be free.\" In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the Summerhill School in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.\\nAnarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child\\'s right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.\\nLate 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers (Paul Goodman, Herbert Read, and Colin Ward) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children\\'s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society. Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.\\nWhile few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.\\nThe arts.\\nThe connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others. In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the New Apocalyptics and the neo-romanticism movement. In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk. Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.\\nOther anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends. In his book \"Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas\", Chris Robé claims that \"anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.\" Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists (Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, Gustav Landauer and Camillo Berneri) and publications such as \"Anarchy\" wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.\\nThree overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect. The 19th-century neo-impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism. In \"Les chataigniers a Osny\" by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro, the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.\\nCriticism.\\nThe most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher Bertrand Russell supported this critique, stating that \"[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.\" Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism.\\nPhilosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory. Anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.\\nPhilosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as A. John Simmons\\' \"Moral Principles and Political Obligations\". Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate. In \"The Problem of Political Authority\", Michael Huemer defends philosophical anarchism, claiming that \"political authority is a moral illusion.\"\\nOne of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority. Joseph Raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success. Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities\\' successful and mistaken instruction. Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment. Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively. Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.\\nFriedrich Engels, considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism, criticised anarchism\\'s anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian. Academic John Molyneux writes in his book \"Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism\" that \"anarchism cannot win\", believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas. The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"13\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13\" title=\"AfghanistanHistory\">\\nAfghanistanHistory\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"14\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14\" title=\"AfghanistanGeography\">\\nAfghanistanGeography\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"15\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15\" title=\"AfghanistanPeople\">\\nAfghanistanPeople\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"18\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18\" title=\"AfghanistanCommunications\">\\nAfghanistanCommunications\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"19\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19\" title=\"AfghanistanTransportations\">\\nAfghanistanTransportations\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"20\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20\" title=\"AfghanistanMilitary\">\\nAfghanistanMilitary\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"21\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21\" title=\"AfghanistanTransnationalIssues\">\\nAfghanistanTransnationalIssues\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"23\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23\" title=\"AssistiveTechnology\">\\nAssistiveTechnology\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"24\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24\" title=\"AmoeboidTaxa\">\\nAmoeboidTaxa\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"25\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25\" title=\"Autism\">\\nAutism\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"27\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27\" title=\"AlbaniaHistory\">\\nAlbaniaHistory\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"29\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29\" title=\"AlbaniaPeople\">\\nAlbaniaPeople\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"30\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30\" title=\"AsWeMayThink\">\\nAsWeMayThink\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"35\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35\" title=\"AlbaniaGovernment\">\\nAlbaniaGovernment\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"36\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36\" title=\"AlbaniaEconomy\">\\nAlbaniaEconomy\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"39\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39\" title=\"Albedo\">\\nAlbedo\\n\\nAlbedo (; ) is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.\\nSurface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity \"J\"e to the irradiance \"E\"e (flux per unit area) received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth\\'s surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location, and time (see position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.\\nUnless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes visible light (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).\\nAlbedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its \"planetary albedo\", is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.\\nThe term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work \"Photometria\".\\nTerrestrial albedo.\\nAny albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.\\nEarth\\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA\\'s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.\\nEarth\\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about . If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below . If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about . In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost .\\nIn 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998–2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.\\nWhite-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo.\\nFor land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle \"θ\"\"i\" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:\\nwith formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo formula_5 (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:\\nThis formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.\\nExamples of terrestrial albedo effects.\\nIllumination.\\nAlbedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth\\'s surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.\\nInsolation effects.\\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.\\nArctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth. This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.\\nClimate and weather.\\nAlbedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.\\nAlbedo–temperature feedback.\\nWhen an area\\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.\\nSnow.\\nSnow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).\\nJust as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming.\\nCryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.\\nThe dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.\\nSmall-scale effects.\\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.\\nSolar photovoltaic effects.\\nAlbedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10% for vertically (90°) mounted systems, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts. Spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains of over 20% have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation. An analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.\\nTrees.\\nBecause forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds. Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.\\nIn seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15. Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy. The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.\\nStudies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.\\nWater.\\nWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations.\\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.\\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.\\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \\'black\\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\\nSnow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.\\nClouds.\\nCloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\"\\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.\\nAerosol effects.\\nAerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth\\'s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per Spracklen et al. the effects are:\\nIn extremely polluted cities like Delhi, aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day.\\nBlack carbon.\\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.\\nHuman activities.\\nHuman activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. As per Campra et al., human impacts to \"the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the Earth’s radiative energy balance\" even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites. \\nThe tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in Almería, Spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs. A 2008 study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface area temperature of the high-albedo area, although changes were localized. A follow-up study found that \"CO2-eq. emissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land transformation\" and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change.\\nIt has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo (commonly being 0.01–0.02 lower than adjacent croplands), which contributes to global warming. Deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate urban heat island. Ouyang et al. estimated that, on a global scale, \"an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 Gt of CO2 emissions.\" \\nIntentionally enhancing the albedo of the Earth\\'s surface, along with its daytime thermal emittance, has been proposed as a solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC). Efforts toward widespread implementation of PDRCs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to high values, so long as a thermal emittance of at least 90% can be achieved.\\nAstronomical albedo.\\nIn astronomy, the term albedo can be defined in several different ways, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved. \\nOptical or visual albedo.\\nThe albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.\\nEnceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds.\\nThe overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.\\nTwo common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.\\nIn detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces. One of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single-scattering albedo. It is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (refractive index), the size of the particle, and the wavelength of the incoming radiation. \\nAn important relationship between an object\\'s astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is given by:\\nformula_7\\nwhere formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude.\\nRadar albedo.\\nIn planetary radar astronomy, a microwave (or radar) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target (e.g. Moon, asteroid, etc.) and the echo from the target is measured. In most instances, the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse (SC) and the opposite sense (OC). The echo power is measured in terms of radar cross-section, formula_11, formula_12, or formula_13 (total power, SC + OC) and is equal to the cross-sectional area of a metallic sphere (perfect reflector) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power.\\nThose components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections (as from a smooth or mirror-like surface) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection. If the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith, there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering.\\nFor most objects in the solar system, the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the (normalized) OC radar albedo (often shortened to radar albedo):\\nformula_14\\nwhere the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius, formula_15. A smooth metallic sphere would have formula_16.\\nRadar albedos of Solar System objects.\\nThe values reported for the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Comet P/2005 JQ5 are derived from the total (OC+SC) radar albedo reported in those references.\\nRelationship to surface bulk density.\\nIn the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections (formula_17 or so), the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient (aka reflectivity) and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so (a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale) using the following empirical relationships:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"40\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40\"

or a, is the first letter and the first vowel of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is \"a\" (pronounced ), plural \"aes\". It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.\\nIn English grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", are indefinite articles.\\nHistory.\\nThe earliest certain ancestor of \"A\" is aleph (also written \\'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.\\nWhen the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the eighth century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\\nThe Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.\\nTypographic variants.\\nDuring Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.\\nAt the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the ninth century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.\\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \"Italic\" and \"Roman\" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \"script a,\" is used in most current handwriting; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right (\"ɑ\"). This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (\"a\"). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the \"Italic\" and \"Roman\" forms as \"single decker a\" and \"double decker a\" respectively.\\nItalic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where \"script a\" (\"ɑ\"), also called Latin alpha, is used in contrast with Latin \"a\" (such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet).\\nUse in writing systems.\\nEnglish.\\nIn modern English orthography, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds:\\nThe double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \"Aaron\" and \"aardvark\". However, occurs in many common digraphs, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .\\n is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after and ) and French, the second most common in Spanish, and the most common in Portuguese. About 8.167% of letters used in English texts tend to be ; the number is around 7.636% in French, 11.525% in Spanish, and 14.634% for Portuguese.\\nOther languages.\\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . An exception is Saanich, in which (and the glyph Á) stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel .\\nOther systems.\\nIn phonetic and phonemic notation:\\nOther uses.\\nIn algebra, the letter \"a\" along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a variable, with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics. Moreover, in 1637, René Descartes \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c\", and this convention is still often followed, especially in elementary algebra.\\nIn geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.\\n\"A\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A−, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students\\' schoolwork; \"A grade\" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.\\n\"A\" is used as a prefix on some words, such as asymmetry, to mean \"not\" or \"without\" (from Greek).\\nIn English grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", is an indefinite article, used to introduce noun phrases.\\nFinally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.\\nCode points.\\nThese are the code points for the forms of the letter in various systems\\nUse as a number.\\nIn the hexadecimal (base 16) numbering system, A is a number that corresponds to the number 10 in decimal (base 10) counting.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"291\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291\" title=\"AnarchoCapitalism\">\\nAnarchoCapitalism\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"293\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293\" title=\"AnarchoCapitalists\">\\nAnarchoCapitalists\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"296\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296\" title=\"ActressesS\">\\nActressesS\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"299\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299\" title=\"AnAmericanInParis\">\\nAnAmericanInParis\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"301\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301\" title=\"AutoMorphism\">\\nAutoMorphism\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"302\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302\" title=\"ActionFilm\">\\nActionFilm\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"303\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303\" title=\"Alabama\">\\nAlabama\\n\\nAlabama () is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States, bordered by Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. With a total of of inland waterways, Alabama has among the most of any state.\\nAlabama is nicknamed the \"Yellowhammer State\", after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama\\'s capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville. Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana. Greater Birmingham is Alabama\\'s largest metropolitan area and its economic center.\\nOriginally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American Revolutionary War. Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used African American slave labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state\\'s economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against African Americans and also Alabama\\'s French Creole population from the late 19th century up until the 1960s.\\nIn the early 20th century, despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid-20th century. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. During and after World War II, Alabama grew as the state\\'s economy diversified with new industries. NASA\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama\\'s economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an aerospace industry. Alabama\\'s economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.\\nThe state\\'s geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the Deep South, Alabama is predominantly a conservative state, and is known for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American football, particularly at the college level at schools such as the University of Alabama, Auburn University, Alabama A&amp;M University, Alabama State University, Troy University, the University of South Alabama, and Jacksonville State University, plays a major part of the state\\'s culture.\\nEtymology.\\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river. In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is (or variously or in different dialects; the plural form is ). The word\\'s spelling varies significantly among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used , while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote \"Alibamu\" and \"Limamu\", respectively, in transliterations of the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the , with French maps identifying the river as . Other spellings of the name have included \"Alibamu\", \"Alabamo\", \"Albama\", \"Alebamon\", \"Alibama\", \"Alibamou\", \"Alabamu\", \"Allibamou\". and possibly \"Alabahmu\". The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U.S.; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin.\\nSources disagree on the word\\'s meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw (meaning \\'plants\\' or \\'weeds\\') and (meaning \\'to cut\\', \\'to trim\\', or \\'to gather\\'). The meaning may have been \\'clearers of the thicket\\' or \\'herb gatherers\\', referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. The state has numerous place names of Native American origin. However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language.\\nAn 1842 article in the \"Jacksonville Republican\" proposed it meant \\'Here We Rest\\'. This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek. Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.\\nHistory.\\nPre-European settlement.\\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000BCE700CE) and continued until European contact.\\nThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama. This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars\\' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.\\nAmong the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (\"Alibamu\"), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati. While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.\\nEuropean settlement.\\nThe Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region\\'s first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.\\nAfter the French lost to the British in the Seven Years\\' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.\\nThomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s. The district\\'s boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.\\nWhat is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.\\nWith the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal. Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.\\n19th century.\\nBefore Mississippi\\'s admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory. The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.\\nAlabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.\\nCahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.\\nSoutheastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners\\' wealth grew mainly from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.\\nFrom 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama\\'s capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.\\nCivil War and Reconstruction.\\nBy 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color. On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy\\'s capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.\\nA company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest\\'s battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coattails. This led to them being greeted with \"Yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.\\nAlabama\\'s slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.\\nFollowing the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state\\'s first public school system and expanded women\\'s rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.\\nReconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor\\'s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.\\n20th century.\\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test. The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades. The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.\\nWhile the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans. Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.\\nThe rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.\\nBeginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers\\' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\nContinued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"historical populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.\\nAt the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"Magic City\". By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.\\nIndustrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.\\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham\\'s industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"\\nIn the United States Supreme Court cases of \"Baker v. Carr\" (1962) and \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties.\\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation. The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery bus boycott (1955–1956), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.\\nLegal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court. According to \"The New York Times\", by 2017, many of Alabama\\'s African Americans were living in Alabama\\'s cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry.\"\\nIn 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years. Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.\\nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, \"Dillard v. Crenshaw County\", challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.\\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.\\nBeginning in the 1960s, the state\\'s economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011. However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state\\'s older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state\\'s economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.\\n21st century.\\nIn 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.\\nA few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty-first century. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 storm upon landfall, struck the state and caused over $18 billion of damage. It was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history. A super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in April 2011 and killed 238 people, devastating many communities.\\nGeography.\\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States. About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.\\nAlabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to more than in the northeast, to Mount Cheaha at .\\nAlabama\\'s land consists of of forest or 67% of the state\\'s total land area. Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.\\nAreas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee. Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead. Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.\\nNotable natural wonders include: the \"Natural Bridge\" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, features one of the largest cave entrances and stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico; DeSoto Caverns in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States; Noccalula Falls in Gadsden features a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon near Phil Campbell, home to two waterfalls, six natural bridges and allegedly served as a hideout for legendary outlaw Jesse James; Stephens Gap Cave in Jackson County boasts a 143-foot pit, two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America; Little River Canyon near Fort Payne, one of the nation\\'s longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns near Warrior features an underground pool, blind cave fish and 260-million-year-old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon on the Alabama-Tennessee state line.\\nA -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of \"Alabama\\'s greatest natural disaster\". A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (\"star-wound\") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.\\nClimate.\\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical (\"Cfa\") under the Koppen Climate Classification. The average annual temperature is 64°F (18°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.\\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.\\nSouth Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.\\nAlabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013. Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.\\nThe peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains.\\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include New Year\\'s Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.\\nAlabama\\'s highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market.\\nFlora and fauna.\\nAlabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.\\nAlabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.\\nIndigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species, 93 reptile species, 73 amphibian species, roughly 307 native freshwater fish species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.\\nDemographics.\\nAccording to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279 on April 1, 2020, which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12%, since the 2010 census. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 (502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state.\\nImmigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000). Alabama has the 5th highest African American population among US states at 25.8% as of 2020.\\nThe center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.\\nAncestry.\\nThose citing \"American\" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most English Americans identify simply as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in many cases since the early 1600s. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.\\nIn 2011, 46.6% of Alabama\\'s population younger than age1 were minorities. The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are American (13.4%), Irish (10.5%), English (10.2%), German (7.9%), and Scots-Irish (2.5%) based on 2006-2008 Census data.\\nThe Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.\\nIn 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following.\\nThe state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.\\nLanguage.\\nMost Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly Southern, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final \"r\", for example the \"boyd\" pronunciation of \"bird\". In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland \"arm\" and \"barb\" rhyming with \"form\" and \"orb\", respectively. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).\\nReligion.\\nIn the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion. The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.\\nAlabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. , the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.\\nIn Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA—28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)—26,247 members in 147 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church—6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).\\nIn a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a \"full understanding\" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.\\nAlthough in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Baháʼí Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.\\nJews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha\\'arai Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox, four Conservative, ten Reform, and one Humanistic synagogue.\\nMuslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.\\nSeveral Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa.\\nThere are six Dharma centers and organizations for Theravada Buddhists. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter. The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.\\nThe first community of adherents of the Baháʼí Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope. Baháʼí centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Huntsville, and Florence.\\nHealth.\\nIn 2018, life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years, below the national average of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country. Factors that can cause lower life expectancy are maternal mortality, suicide, and gun crimes.\\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem, with most counties having more than 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.\\nOn May 14, 2019, Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a \"serious health risk\", with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law subjects doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment. The law was originally supposed to take effect the following November, but on October 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case \"Roe v. Wade\". On June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned \"Roe v. Wade\" in \"Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization\", Judge Thompson lifted the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.\\nEconomy.\\nThe state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about one percent of the state\\'s gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.\\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.\\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama\\'s 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.\\nThe state\\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015. This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.\\nAlabama has no minimum wage and in February 2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one. (A Birmingham city ordinance would have raised theirs to $10.10.)\\n, Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S. In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.\\nLargest employers.\\nThe five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:\\nThe next twenty largest employers, , included:\\nAgriculture.\\nAlabama\\'s agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as \"The Cotton State\", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports, with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three.\\nAquaculture.\\nAquaculture is a large part of the economy of Alabama. Alabamians began to practice aquaculture in the early 1960s. U.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th most popular seafood product in America. By 2008, approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by the catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish. In 2020, Alabama produced of the United States\\' farm-raised catfish. The total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $307 million but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442.\\nFrom the early 2000s to 2020, the Alabamian catfish industry has declined from 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors. Reasons for this decline include increased feed prices, catfish alternatives, COVID-19\\'s impact on restaurant sales, disease, and fish size.\\nIndustry.\\nAlabama\\'s industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. In addition, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, the location of NASA\\'s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command, headquartered at Redstone Arsenal.\\nA great deal of Alabama\\'s economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state\\'s expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.\\nAutomakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012. The eight models produced at the state\\'s auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.\\nSteel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility. ThyssenKrupp\\'s stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6billion in March 2013. Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8billion. In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.\\nThe Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and Moundville. JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.\\nThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large plant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929.\\nConstruction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company\\'s first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility. The factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.\\nTourism and entertainment.\\nAccording to Business Insider, Alabama ranked 14th in most popular states to visit in 2014. An estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $14.3 billion, providing directly or indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state, which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $589 million.\\nThe state is home to various attractions, natural features, parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe, notably the annual Hangout Music Festival, held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world; the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, a collection of championship caliber golf courses distributed across the state; casinos such as Victoryland; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure; the Riverchase Galleria, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast; Guntersville Lake, voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers; and the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the oldest museum in the state.\\nMobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebration in the United States, beginning in 1703. It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the United States in 1830, a tradition that continues to this day. Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties.\\nIn 2018, Mobile\\'s Mardi Gras parade was the state\\'s top event, producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811. The top attraction was the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville with an attendance of 849,981, followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090. Of the parks and natural destinations, Alabama\\'s Gulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors.\\nAlabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots due to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments. Movies filmed in Alabama include: Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Get Out, 42, Selma, Big Fish, The Final Destination, Due Date, Need For Speed and many more.\\nHealthcare.\\nUAB Hospital, USA Health University Hospital, Huntsville Hospital, and Children\\'s Hospital of Alabama are the only LevelI trauma centers in Alabama. UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000. A 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84% followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7%.\\nBanking.\\nRegions Financial Corporation is the largest bank headquartered in or operating in Alabama. PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo also have a major presence in Alabama.\\nWells Fargo has a regional headquarters, an operations center campus, and a $400million data center in Birmingham.

Harbert International, based in Alabama and subsidiaries of URS Corporation, are all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms.\\nLaw and government.\\nState government.\\nThe foundational document for Alabama\\'s government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. With over 850 amendments and almost 87,000 words, it is by some accounts the world\\'s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.\\nThere has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama\\'s constitution. Critics argue that Alabama\\'s constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\\nAlabama\\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\\nThe executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the governor of Alabama. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.\\nThe members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.\\nThe judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The state\\'s highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.\\nSome critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger. However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas. Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases. It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries. This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.\\nAlabama is one of the very few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries.\\nTaxes.\\nTaxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue. Alabama levies a 2%, 4%, or5% personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax).\\nThe state\\'s general sales tax rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile County, Alabama is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile County, Alabama would pay an 11% tax on a meal.\\nIn 2020, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 38% of all state and local revenue.\\nOnly Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate.\\nThe corporate income tax rate in Alabama is 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.\\nProperty taxes of .40% of assessed value per year, are the second-lowest in the U.S., after Hawaii. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.\\nCounty and local governments.\\nAlabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission. Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in \"Baker v. Carr\" (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama\\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"\\nAlabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.\\nPolitics.\\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation.\\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state\\'s only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\\nIn 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.\\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.\\n, there are a total of 3,589,839 registered voters, with 3,518,285 active, and the others inactive in the state.\\nElections.\\nIn a 2020 study, Alabama was ranked as the 12th most difficult state for citizens to vote.\\nState elections.\\nWith the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"Solid South\", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\\nMembers of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper Sr. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.\\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999–2003), Kay Ivey (2011–2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019–present).\\nLocal elections.\\nMany local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.\\nAlabama\\'s 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 Democrats, 31 Republicans, and one Independent Fayette. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. , the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in Morgan County, Alabama, and ten African-American sheriffs.\\nFederal elections.\\nThe state\\'s two U.S. senators are Richard C. Shelby and Tommy Tuberville, both of whom are Republican. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.\\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Jerry Carl, Mike Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Mo Brooks, Barry Moore, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell, who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.\\nEducation.\\nPrimary and secondary education.\\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.\\nPublic school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.\\nWhile Alabama\\'s public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama\\'s high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.\\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.\\nColleges and universities.\\nAlabama\\'s programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.\\nThe largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016. Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.\\nAccreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), the Council on Occupational Education (COE), and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).\\nAccording to the 2011 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, Auburn University at 36, and University of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).\\nAccording to the 2012 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", Alabama had four tier one universities (University of Alabama, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama in Huntsville).\\nMedia.\\nMajor newspapers include \"Birmingham News\", Mobile \"Press-Register\", and \"Montgomery Advertiser\".\\nMajor television network affiliates in Alabama include:\\nCulture.\\nSports.\\nProfessional sports.\\nAlabama has several professional and semi-professional sports teams, including three minor league baseball teams.\\nThe Talladega Superspeedway motorsports complex hosts a series of NASCAR events. It has a seating capacity of 143,000 and is the thirteenth largest stadium in the world and sixth largest stadium in America. Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races.\\nThe ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980.\\nAlabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour).\\nCollege sports.\\nCollege football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference. Alabama averages over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averages over 80,000—both numbers among the top twenty in the nation. Bryant–Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821, and is the fifth largest stadium in America. Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.\\nLegion Field is home of the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl. It seats 71,594. Ladd–Peebles Stadium in Mobile is the home of the University of South Alabama football team, and serves as the home of the NCAA Senior Bowl, LendingTree Bowl, and Alabama-Mississippi All Star Classic; the stadium seats 40,646. In 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and Jordan-Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, after previously being held at Legion Field in Birmingham.\\nTransportation.\\nAviation.\\nMajor airports with sustained operations in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL) and Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD).\\nRail.\\nFor rail transport, Amtrak schedules the \"Crescent\", a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.\\nRoads.\\nAlabama has six major interstate routes: Interstate 65 (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. I-22 enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: I-165 in Mobile, I-359 in Tuscaloosa, I-459 around Birmingham, I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville, and I-759 in Gadsden. A sixth route, I-685, will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, I-222 has been proposed, as well.\\nSeveral U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as U.S. Route 11 (US-11), US-29, US-31, US-43, US-45, US-72, US-78, US-80, US-82, US-84, US-90, US-98, US-231, US-278, US-280, US-331, US-411, and US-431.\\nThere are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and Northport; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in Orange Beach.\\nPorts.\\nThe Port of Mobile, Alabama\\'s only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009. The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011. The state\\'s other ports are on rivers with access to the Gulf of Mexico.\\nWater ports of Alabama, listed from north to south:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"304\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304\" title=\"AfricA\">\\nAfricA\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"305\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305\" title=\"Achilles\">\\nAchilles\\n\\nIn Greek mythology, Achilles ( ) or Achilleus () was a hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and the central character of Homer\\'s \"Iliad\". He was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, king of Phthia.\\nAchilles\\' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the \"Iliad\", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with Statius\\' unfinished epic \"Achilleid\", written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel, because when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term \"Achilles\\' heel\" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends.\\nEtymology.\\nLinear B tablets attest to the personal name \"Achilleus\" in the forms \"a-ki-re-u\" and \"a-ki-re-we\", the latter being the dative of the former. The name grew more popular, becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (\"Achilleía\"), attested in Attica in the fourth century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form \"Achillia\", on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an \"Amazon\".\\nAchilles\\' name can be analyzed as a combination of (\\') \"distress, pain, sorrow, grief\" and (\\') \"people, soldiers, nation\", resulting in a proto-form \"*Akhí-lāu̯os\" \"he who has the people distressed\" or \"he whose people have distress\". The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the \"Iliad\" (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles\\' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of \"\" (\"glory\", usually in war). Furthermore, \"laós\" has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean \"a corps of soldiers\", a muster. With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.\\nSome researchers deem the name a loan word, possibly from a Pre-Greek language. Achilles\\' descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity . Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of \"-λλ-\" and \"-λ-\" in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /ly/ in the original language.\\nDescription.\\nIn the account of Dares the Phrygian, Achilles was described having \". . .a large chest, a fine mouth, and powerfully formed arms and legs. His head was covered with long wavy chestnut-colored hair. Though mild in manner, he was very fierce in battle. His face showed the joy of a man richly endowed.\"\\nBirth and early years.\\nAchilles was the son of Thetis, a Nereid and daughter of The Old Man of the Sea, and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetis\\'s hand in marriage until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.\\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the \"Argonautica\" (4.760) Zeus\\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.\\nAccording to the \"Achilleid\", written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to non-surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel . It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.\\nNone of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the \"Iliad\", Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He was ambidextrous, and cast a spear from each hand; one grazed Achilles\\' elbow, \"drawing a spurt of blood\".\\nIn the few fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle which describe the hero\\'s death (i.e. the \"Cypria\", the \"Little Iliad\" by Lesches of Pyrrha, the \"Aithiopis\" and \"Iliou persis\" by Arctinus of Miletus), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel. In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.\\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, who lived on Mount Pelion, to be reared. Thetis foretold that her son\\'s fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan War. According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia with his companion Patroclus.\\nAccording to Photius, the sixth book of the \"New History\" by Ptolemy Hephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus. When she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus, who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles\\' burnt foot.\\nOther names.\\nAmong the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:\\nHidden on Skyros.\\nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros. \\nThere, Achilles, properly disguised, lived among Lycomedes\\' daughters, perhaps under the name \"Pyrrha\" (the red-haired girl), Cercysera or Aissa (\"swift\"). With Lycomedes\\' daughter Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he raped, Achilles there fathered two sons, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father\\'s possible alias) and Oneiros. According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles\\' aid. Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women\\'s clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes\\' women. While the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.\\nIn the Trojan War.\\nAccording to the \"Iliad\", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon.\\nTelephus.\\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that \"he that wounded shall heal\". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.\\nAccording to other reports in Euripides\\' lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles\\' aid in healing the wound. Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.\\nTroilus.\\nAccording to the \"Cypria\" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles\\' wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus, where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes, a son of Apollo, as well as Priam\\'s son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios; however, the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer\\'s \"Troilus and Criseyde\" and in William Shakespeare\\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\" is a medieval invention.\\nIn Dares Phrygius\\' \"Account of the Destruction of Troy\", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, as well as in older accounts, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priam\\'s and Hecuba\\'s five legitimate sons (or according other sources, another son of Apollo). Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders, a \"horse fighter\" or \"chariot fighter\" according to Homer. Prophecies linked Troilus\\' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth\\xa0– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers\\' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles\\' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible; however, the motif is older and found already in Plautus\\' \"Bacchides\".\\nIn the \"Iliad\".\\nHomer\\'s \"Iliad\" is the most famous narrative of Achilles\\' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles\\' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, \"mênis Achilléōs\") is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the \"Iliad\" read:\\nThe Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles\\' death. It begins with Achilles\\' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave. Her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles\\' battle prize Briseis, the daughter of Briseus, be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon\\'s theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.\\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains, Ajax and Phoenix. They promise that, if Achilles returns to battle, Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.\\nThe Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle, wearing Achilles\\' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.\\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion\\'s death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail in the poem.\\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles\\' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, in the form of Hector\\'s favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that \"my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me\". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion.\\nAt the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion\\'s dog (Sirius); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to Hesperus, the evening/western star (Venus), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus, the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).\\nWith the assistance of the god Hermes (Argeiphontes), Hector\\'s father Priam goes to Achilles\\' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector\\'s body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of Niobe\\'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector\\'s funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.\\nLater epic accounts: fighting Penthesilea and Memnon.\\nThe \"Aethiopis\" (7th century BC) and a work named \"Posthomerica\", composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century CE, relate further events from the Trojan War. When Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares, arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.\\nFollowing the death of Patroclus, Nestor\\'s son Antilochus becomes Achilles\\' closest companion. When Memnon, son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia, slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.\\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \"Iliad\"s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles\\' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic \"Aethiopis\", which was composed after the \"Iliad\", possibly in the 7th century BC. The \"Aethiopis\" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.\\nAchilles and Patroclus.\\nThe exact nature of Achilles\\' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the \"Iliad\", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations. Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the \"Iliad\" that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of \"paiderasteia\", which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one, usually a teenager. In Patroclus and Achilles\\' case, Achilles would have been the younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder. In Plato\\'s \"Symposium\", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. However, ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.\\nDeath.\\nThe death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions. Starting with the oldest account, In the \"Iliad Book XXII\", Hector predicts with his last dying breath that Paris and Apollo will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy (with an arrow to the heel according to Statius). \"In Book XXIII\", the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase, a gift of his mother.\\nIn the \"Odyssey Book XI\", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as \"blessed in life, blessed in death\", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son\\'s exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus\\' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.\\nIn the \"Odyssey Book XXIV\" we read dead King Agamemnon\\'s ghostly account of his death: Achilles\\' funeral pyre bleached bones had been mixed with those of Patroclus and put into his mother\\'s golden vase. Also, the bones of Antilocus, who had become closer to Achilles than any other following Patroclus\\' death, were separately enclosed. And, the customary funeral games of a hero were performed, and a massive tomb or mound was built on the Hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate.\\nAchilles was represented in the \"Aethiopis\" as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube. Another version of Achilles\\' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena\\'s hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world\\'s greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. According to some accounts, he had married Medea in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades\\xa0– as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius\\' \"Argonautica\" (3rd century BC).\\nFate of Achilles\\' armour.\\nAchilles\\' armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who, after considering both men\\'s presentations, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (\"Odyssey\" 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.\\nThe armour they fought for was made by Hephaestus thus making it much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft. He was made the gear because his first set was worn by Patroclus when he went to battle and taken by Hector when he killed Patroclus. The Shield of Achilles was also made by the fire god. His legendary spear was given to him by his mentor Chiron before he participated in the Trojan War. It was called the Pelian Spear which allegedly no other man could wield.\\nA relic claimed to be Achilles\\' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the \"Iliad\" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century CE.\\nAchilles, Ajax and a game of \"petteia\".\\nNumerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game (\"petteia\"). They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle. The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.\\nWorship and heroic cult.\\nThe tomb of Achilles, extant throughout antiquity in Troad, was venerated by Thessalians, but also by Persian expeditionary forces, as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla. Achilles\\' cult was also to be found at other places, e. g. on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades, in Sparta which had a sanctuary, in Elis and in Achilles\\' homeland Thessaly, as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum, Locri and Croton, accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero.\\nThe cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BC Polyxena sarcophagus, which depicts the sacrifice of Polyxena near the tumulus of Achilles. Strabo (13.1.32) also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad:\\nThe spread and intensity of the hero\\'s veneration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus, today\\'s Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with Snake Island (Ukrainian Зміїний, \"Zmiinyi\", near Kiliya, Ukraine). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea (graffiti and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being votive offerings, from Olbia, the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese) attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century CE, when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an \"Achilles Pontárchēs\" (Ποντάρχης, roughly \"lord of the Sea,\" or \"of the Pontus Euxinus\"), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates, Hermes Agoraeus, or Poseidon.\\nPliny the Elder (23–79 AD) in his \"Natural History\" mentions a \"port of the Achæi\" and an \"island of Achilles\", famous for the tomb of that \"man\" (), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper-Bug Estuary; furthermore, at 125\\xa0Roman miles from this island, he places a peninsula \"which stretches forth in the shape of a sword\" obliquely, called \"Dromos Achilleos\" (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, \"Achilléōs drómos\" \"the Race-course of Achilles\") and considered the place of the hero\\'s exercise or of games instituted by him. This last feature of Pliny\\'s account is considered to be the iconic spit, called today \"Tendra\" (or \"Kosa Tendra\" and \"Kosa Djarilgatch\"), situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay, but which is hardly 125\\xa0Roman miles (\\xa0km) away from the Dnieper-Bug estuary, as Pliny states. (To the \"Race-course\" he gives a length of 80\\xa0miles, \\xa0km, whereas the spit measures \\xa0km today.)\\nIn the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as \"Achillea\" and introduces two further names for it: \"Leuce\" or \"Macaron\" (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν \"island of the blest\"). The \"present day\" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of \"Achillea\" or \"Leuce\" with today\\'s Snake Island. Pliny\\'s contemporary Pomponius Mela () tells that Achilles was buried on an island named \"Achillea\", situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister, adding to the geographical confusion. Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly () in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC black-glazed lekythos inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: \"Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.\" In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island\\'s cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.\\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on \"Leuce\" seems to go back to an account from the lost epic \"Aethiopis\" according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical (\"Leúkē Nêsos\" \"White Island\"). Already in the fifth century BC, Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a \"bright island\" (φαεννά νᾶσος, \"phaenná nâsos\") of the Black Sea, while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus. Well known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, \"makárôn nêsoi\") or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it. Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus, speaking of \"Achilles lord of Scythia\" and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles\\' fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon, who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death.\\nThe \"Periplus of the Euxine Sea\" () gives the following details:\\nThe Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes, who likely lived during the first century CE, wrote that the island was called \"Leuce\" \"because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour\". Similarly, others relate the island\\'s name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there. Pausanias has been told that the island is \"covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles\\' temple and his statue\". Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. Ammianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters (\"aquae\") on the island.\\nStrabo mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to Achilles and although it was treeless, was called Alsos (ἄλσος). \"Alsos\" in Greek means \"grove\".\\nA number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. Herodotus, Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town \"Achílleion\" (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC, close to the hero\\'s presumed burial mound in the Troad. Later attestations point to an \"Achílleion\" in Messenia (according to Stephanus Byzantinus) and an \"Achílleios\" (Ἀχίλλειος) in Laconia. Nicolae Densuşianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called Chilia (presumably from an older \"Achileii\"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.\\nThe kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. Alexander the Great, son of the Epirote princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla, while on his way to war against Parthia, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles\\' tumulus.\\nReception during antiquity.\\nIn Greek tragedy.\\nThe Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title \"Achilleis\" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the \"Achilleis\" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the \"Achilleis\" trilogy, \"The Myrmidons\", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato\\'s \"Symposium\", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him.\\nThe tragedian Sophocles also wrote \"The Lovers of Achilles\", a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.\\nTowards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in \"Hecuba\", \"Electra\", and \"Iphigenia in Aulis\".\\nIn Greek philosophy.\\nZeno.\\nThe philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between \"swift-footed\" Achilles and a tortoise, by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.\\nPlato.\\nIn \"Hippias Minor\", a dialogue attributed to Plato, an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates. The two get into a discussion about lying. They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be \"better\" than a person who is unintentionally false, on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying. Socrates uses various analogies, discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point. The two also reference Homer extensively. Socrates and Hippias agree that Odysseus, who concocted a number of lies throughout the \"Odyssey\" and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle, was false intentionally. Achilles, like Odysseus, told numerous falsehoods. Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man, while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit. The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally.\\nIn Roman and medieval literature.\\nThe Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles. Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. Other writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles\\' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure\\'s \"Roman de Troie\" and Guido delle Colonne\\'s \"Historia destructionis Troiae\", which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century.\\nAchilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon, not as Hellene, but as Scythian, while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas, his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars.\\nIn modern literature and arts.\\nMusic.\\nAchilles has been frequently the subject of operas, ballets and related genres.\\nFilm and television.\\nIn films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"306\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306\" title=\"AppliedStatistics\">\\nAppliedStatistics\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"307\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307\" title=\"Abraham Lincoln\">\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n\\nAbraham Lincoln ( ; February 12, 1809\\xa0– April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the Union. During this time, the newly formed Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.\\nLincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called \"Copperheads\") despised Lincoln, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South\\'s trade. He suspended \"habeas corpus\" in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted British intervention by defusing the \"Trent\" Affair. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons\" and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which upon its ratification abolished slavery.\\nLincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the war\\'s end at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford\\'s Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.\\nFamily and childhood.\\nEarly life.\\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Lincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia; his paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba (née Herring) moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky. The captain was killed in an Indian raid in 1786. His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham\\'s father, witnessed the attack. Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.\\nThe heritage of Lincoln\\'s mother Nancy remains unclear, but it is widely assumed that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks. Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.\\nThomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but of his land in court disputes over property titles. In 1816, the family moved to Indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable. Indiana was a \"free\" (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an \"unbroken forest\" in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana. In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family\\'s move to Indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties.\\nIn Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. At various times, he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.\\nOvercoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to in Indiana, an area which became the Little Pigeon Creek Community.\\nMother\\'s death.\\nOn October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Nancy\\'s 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks. Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln.\\nOn December 2, 1819, Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston, a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own. Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her \"Mother\". Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. His family even said he was lazy, for all his \"reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.\". His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy \"physical labor\", but loved to read.\\nEducation and move to Illinois.\\nLincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling was from itinerant teachers. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read but probably not to write, at age seven, and in Indiana, where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15. He persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the King James Bible, Aesop\\'s Fables, John Bunyan\\'s \"The Pilgrim\\'s Progress\", Daniel Defoe\\'s \"Robinson Crusoe\", and \"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\".\\nAs a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21. Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax. He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch-as-catch-can style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21. He gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as \"the Clary\\'s Grove Boys\".\\nIn March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in Macon County. Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father\\'s lack of education. In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham struck out on his own. He made his home in New Salem, Illinois, for six years. Lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was first exposed to slavery.\\nIn 1865, Lincoln was asked how he came to acquire his rhetorical skills. He answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across the word \"demonstrate\" but had insufficient understanding of the term. So, he left Springfield for his father\\'s home to study until he \"could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid [here, referencing Euclid\\'s \"Elements\"] at sight.\"\\nMarriage and children.\\nLincoln\\'s first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he moved to New Salem. By 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.\\nLate in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.\\nIn 1839, Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois, and the following year they became engaged. She was the daughter of Robert Smith Todd, a wealthy lawyer and businessman in Lexington, Kentucky. A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled at Lincoln\\'s request, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary\\'s sister. While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, \"To hell, I suppose.\" In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.\\nLincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The oldest, Robert Todd Lincoln, was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity. Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln\\'s third son, \"Willie\" Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the White House on February 20, 1862. The youngest, Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871. Lincoln \"was remarkably fond of children\" and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own. In fact, Lincoln\\'s law partner William H. Herndon would grow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children\\'s behavior. Herndon recounted, \"I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.\"\\nThe deaths of their sons, Eddie and Willie, had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from \"melancholy\", a condition now thought to be clinical depression. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert committed her for a time to an asylum in 1875.\\nEarly career and militia service.\\nDuring 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War. When Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with William Berry, 21, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers single beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well. As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint. They offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. But Berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself. Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing Lincoln to sell his share.\\nIn his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his \"neck and the seat of his trousers\", and tossed him. In the campaign, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He could draw crowds as a raconteur, but lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.\\nLincoln served as New Salem\\'s postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer. Rather than studying in the office of an established attorney, as was the custom, Lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys John Todd Stuart and Thomas Drummond, purchased books including Blackstone\\'s \"Commentaries\" and Chitty\\'s \"Pleadings\", and read law on his own. He later said of his legal education that \"I studied with nobody.\"\\nIllinois state legislature (1834–1842).\\nLincoln\\'s second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a Whig, was a success over a powerful Whig opponent. Then followed his four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County. He championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and later was a Canal Commissioner. He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and abolition. In 1837, he declared, \"[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\" He echoed Henry Clay\\'s support for the American Colonization Society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia.\\nHe was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836, and moved to Springfield and began to practice law under John T. Stuart, Mary Todd\\'s cousin. Lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered several years with Stephen T. Logan, and in 1844 began his practice with William Herndon, \"a studious young man\".\\nU.S. House of Representatives (1847–1849).\\nTrue to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay\". Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.\\nIn 1843, Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois\\' 7th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; he was defeated by John J. Hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846 but also won the election. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line. He was assigned to the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department. Lincoln teamed with Joshua R. Giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He dropped the bill when it eluded Whig support.\\nPolitical views.\\nOn foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the Mexican–American War, which he imputed to President James K. Polk\\'s desire for \"military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\". He supported the Wilmot Proviso, a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.\\nLincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had \"invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil.\" Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil. The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him \"spotty Lincoln\". Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.\\nLincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office. The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory as consolation. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.\\nPrairie lawyer.\\nIn his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\". Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years. Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation\\'s western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in \"Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company\", a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent.\\nLincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor. From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad. His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname \"Honest Abe\".\\nLincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial, defending William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln\\'s use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a \"Farmers\\' Almanac\" showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.\\nLeading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case, with his defense of Simeon Quinn \"Peachy\" Harrison who was a third cousin; Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln\\'s political opponent, Rev. Peter Cartwright. Harrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who, as he lay dying of his wounds, confessed to Cartwright that he had provoked Harrison. Lincoln angrily protested the judge\\'s initial decision to exclude Cartwright\\'s testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay. Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in Harrison\\'s acquittal.\\nRepublican politics (1854–1860).\\nEmergence as Republican leader.\\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue. In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter\\'s support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue. As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas\\'s Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.\\nLincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his \"Peoria Speech\" of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. He said the Kansas Act had a \"\"declared\" indifference, but as I must think, a covert \"real\" zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world...\" Lincoln\\'s attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.\\nNationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, \"I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist... I do no more than oppose the \"extension\" of slavery.\" The new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists. Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party\\'s growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.\\nIn 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year\\'s elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath, Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln\\'s decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull\\'s antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.\\n1856 campaign.\\nViolent political confrontations in Kansas continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform endorsed Congress\\'s right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, John C. Frémont and William Dayton comprised the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. Buchanan prevailed, while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.\\n\"Dred Scott v. Sandford\".\\nDred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise. After Scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857). In his opinion, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners\\' \"property\" rights. While many Democrats hoped that \"Dred Scott\" would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North. Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power. He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal \"in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\".\\nLincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech.\\nIn 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln\\'s 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor. Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state. Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.\\nLincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his House Divided Speech, with the biblical reference Mark 3:25, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\" The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion. The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas. When informed of Lincoln\\'s nomination, Douglas stated, \"[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party\\xa0... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.\"\\nThe Senate campaign featured seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that Douglas\\' \"Slave Power\" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers\\' premise that all men are created equal. Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. Lincoln\\'s argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas\\'s argument was more legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the \"Dred Scott\" decision.\\nThough the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. Lincoln\\'s articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the \"Illinois Staats-Anzeiger\", a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state\\'s 130,000 German Americans voted Democratically but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support. In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek office. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months\\' several local papers endorsed his candidacy.\\nOver the coming months, Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the Midwestern United States, he was less appreciated in the east. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln\\'s compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court\\'s Dred-Scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.\\nOn February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union, in which he argued that the Founding Fathers of the United States had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any \"groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong\". Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly. But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. Journalist Noah Brooks reported, \"No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.\"\\nHistorian David Herbert Donald described the speech as \"a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. Appearing in Seward\\'s home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase, Lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination\". In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, \"The taste \"is\" in my mouth a little.\"\\n1860 presidential election.\\nOn May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. Lincoln\\'s followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln\\'s supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy.\\nOn May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln\\'s success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.\\nPennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state\\'s iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln\\'s managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln\\'s dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\".\\nAs the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas\\'s position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.\\nPrior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.\\nAs Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln\\'s life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party\\'s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a \"Chicago Tribune\" writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln\\'s life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies. Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.\\nOn November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. His victory in the Electoral College was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.\\nPresidency (1861–1865).\\nSecession and inauguration.\\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln\\'s election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861.\\nAttempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed Crittenden Compromise as contrary to the Party\\'s platform of free-soil in the territories. Lincoln said, \"I will suffer death before I consent\\xa0... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.\"\\nLincoln tacitly supported the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed. A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.\\nOn February 11, 1861, Lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving Springfield; he would never again return to Springfield alive. Lincoln traveled east in a special train. Due to secessionist plots, a then-unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train. En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect evaded suspected assassins in Baltimore. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:\\n Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating \"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.\" The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: \"Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\"\\nCivil War.\\nMajor Robert Anderson, commander of the Union\\'s Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln\\'s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion.\\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the South was preparing for war. Donald concludes that, \"His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.\"\\nOn April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of Richmond as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral. The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to defend the nation.\\nAs States sent Union regiments south, on April 19, Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains. Local leaders\\' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of \"habeas corpus\" where needed for the security of troops trying to reach Washington. John Merryman, one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of \"habeas corpus.\" In June, in Ex parte Merryman, Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court, issued the writ, believing that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it. But Lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.\\nUnion military strategy.\\nLincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the Union military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended \"habeas corpus\", and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.\\nIt was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.\\nIn August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity. As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.\\nInternationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy. He relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while working closely with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner. In the 1861 Trent Affair which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the \"Trent\", on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln\\'s successful techniques:\\nLincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors, and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced War Secretary Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton. Stanton centralized the War Department\\'s activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000. Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. \"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together\", say Thomas and Hyman.\\nLincoln\\'s war strategy embraced two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory. Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard. For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General Henry Halleck entitled \"Elements of Military Art and Science\"; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini. Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy\\'s army, rather than merely capturing territory.\\nIn directing the Union\\'s war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of Gen. Winfield Scott, even after his retirement as Commanding General of the United States Army. On June 23–24, 1862, President Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point, where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department.\\nGeneral McClellan.\\nAfter the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott\\'s retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief. McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign. McClellan\\'s slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln\\'s reservation of troops for the capitol.\\nIn 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan for the general\\'s continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed John Pope as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope satisfied Lincoln\\'s desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thus protecting Washington from counterattack. But Pope was then soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington.\\nDespite his dissatisfaction with McClellan\\'s failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington. Two days after McClellan\\'s return to command, General Robert E. Lee\\'s forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam. That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln\\'s Emancipation Proclamation in January.\\nMcClellan then resisted the president\\'s demand that he pursue Lee\\'s withdrawing army, while General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln\\'s part.\\nBurnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with Joseph Hooker.\\nIn the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of \"habeas corpus\", military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.\\nIn the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.\\nHooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, then resigned and was replaced by George Meade. Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg Campaign, but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln\\'s demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states.\\nEmancipation Proclamation.\\nThe Federal government\\'s power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states. Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. He sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves. Lincoln rejected Major General John C. Frémont\\'s August 1861 emancipation attempt, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede.\\nIn June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. Lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.\\nPrivately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy\\'s slave base had to be eliminated. Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification; Republican editor Horace Greeley of the \"New York Tribune\" agreed. In a letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free, regardless of that, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:\\nOn September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which announced that, in states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, the slaves would be freed. He kept his word and, on January 1, 1863, issued the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas under such control. Lincoln\\'s comment on signing the Proclamation was: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" He spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.\\nWith the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south liberated all three million slaves in the Confederacy. The Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be \"received into the armed service of the United States,\" enlisting these freedmen became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, \"The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once\". By the end of 1863, at Lincoln\\'s direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.\\nGettysburg Address (1863).\\nLincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\". He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".\\nDefying his prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.\\nPromoting General Grant.\\nGeneral Ulysses Grant\\'s victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can\\'t spare this man. He fights.\" With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade\\'s failure to capture Lee\\'s army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade\\'s army.\\nLincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant\\'s political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since George Washington. Authorization for such a promotion \"with the advice and consent of the Senate\" was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant\\'s name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.\\nGrant in 1864 waged the bloody Overland Campaign, which exacted heavy losses on both sides. When Lincoln asked what Grant\\'s plans were, the persistent general replied, \"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" Grant\\'s army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant\\'s headquarters at City Point, Virginia, to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North. Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to weaken the South\\'s morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake. Lincoln\\'s engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington, D.C. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future Supreme Court Justice) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\"\\nAs Grant continued to weaken Lee\\'s forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized. On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, officially ending the war.\\nReelection.\\nLincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions, along with War Democrats Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals\\' efforts to replace him. At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.\\nGrant\\'s bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln\\'s re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House; Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows:\\nThe Democratic platform followed the \"Peace wing\" of the party and called the war a \"failure\"; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman\\'s capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut\\'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism. The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln\\'s support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads. On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.\\nOn March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God\\'s will. Historian Mark Noll places the speech \"among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;\" it is inscribed in the Lincoln Memorial. Lincoln said:\\nReconstruction.\\nReconstruction preceded the war\\'s end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let \\'em up easy.\" Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one. Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln\\'s allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.\\nAs Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans\\' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 Wade–Davis Bill, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.\\nLincoln\\'s appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney\\'s seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals\\' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.\\nAfter implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole matter\" and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress. This first attempt fell short of the required two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Passage became part of Lincoln\\'s reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865. With ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.\\nLincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner\\'s Freedmen\\'s Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.\\nHistorians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current, according to David Lincove, argue that:\\nEric Foner argues that:\\nNative Americans.\\nLincoln\\'s experience with Native Americans started early with their killing of his grandfather in front of the family. Later he served as a Captain in the state militia during the Black Hawk War seeing no combat. During his presidency, his policy toward Indians was based on politics. He used appointments to the Indian Bureau as a reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin. While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.\\nOn August 17, 1862, the Sioux or Dakota uprising broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed, 30,000 were displaced from their homes, and Washington was deeply alarmed. Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier. Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising. When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in Minnesota. Lincoln sent General John Pope to Minnesota as commander of the new Department of the Northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities. Before he arrived the Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa sent Lincoln a letter begging to go to war for the United States against the Sioux, so Lincoln could send Minnesota\\'s troops to fight the south. Shortly after, a Mille Lacs Band Chief offered the same at St. Cloud, Minnesota. In it the Chippewa specified that they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare. That meant there would be no prisoners of war, no surrender, no peace agreement. Lincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer, as he had no means to control the outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare. Once word reached the other bands of Chippewa, he had no way of knowing how they would react to his sending the Fond Du Lac on the warpath. One of the Chippewa signing the letter, Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub, had received a Presidential medal from Lincoln earlier in the year.\\nServing under Gen. Pope was Minnesota Congressman Henry H. Sibley. Minnesota\\'s Governor had made Sibley a Colonel United States Volunteers to command the US force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated Little Crow\\'s forces at the Battle of Wood Lake. \\nThe day the Mdewakanton force surrendered at Camp Release, a Chippewa war council met at Minnesota\\'s capitol with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln, to fight the Sioux. Sibley ordered a military commission to review that actions of the captured to try those that had committed war crimes. The legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the Mexican War. Sibley thought he had 16-20 of men he wanted for trial while Gen. Pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried. When it was done, 303 had been given death sentences that were subject to Presidential review. Lincoln ordered Gen Pope send all of the trial transcripts Washington where he and two of his staff poured over the trials. The lawyer in Lincoln saw issues. He slowly realized that the trials could be divided into two groups: combat between combatants and combat against civilians. The groups could be identified by their transcripts, the first group were all just three pages in length while the second group had more pages, some up to twelve. He placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences for the largest mass commutation in history. Into the second group went forty. One he commuted for turning state\\'s witness. Another Sibley dismissed when overwhelming proof surfaced exonerating the man. The remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass hanging in US history. Very quickly questions arose concerning three of the executions that have not been answered. Less than four months after the executions Lincoln issued General Order 100 that relates more to the Minnesota War than the Civil War. Now a Congressman, Alexander Ramsey told Lincoln, in 1864, that he would have gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton. Lincoln responded, \"I could not afford to hang men for votes.\" The men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at Davenport, Iowa. A few of those he had released due to the efforts of Bishop Henry Whipple.\\nWhig theory of a presidency.\\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress\\' responsibility for legislating. Lincoln vetoed only four bills, including the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program. The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States\\' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.\\nIn the selection and use of his cabinet, Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, \"We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.\" Goodwin described the group in her biography as a \"Team of Rivals\".\\nThere were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariffs, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (). The Revenue Act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income.\\nThe Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the federal government\\'s economic influence in other areas. The National Banking Act created the system of national banks. The US issued paper currency for the first time, known as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side. In 1862, Congress created the Department of Agriculture.\\nIn response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the \"New York World\" and the \"Journal of Commerce\" published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.\\nLincoln is largely responsible for the Thanksgiving holiday. Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during James Madison\\'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.\\nIn June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.\\nSupreme Court appointments.\\nLincoln\\'s philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\" Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln\\'s campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln\\'s Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.\\nForeign policy.\\nLincoln named his main political rival William H. Seward as Secretary of State, and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio. However Lincoln did select some of the top diplomats as part of his patronage policy. He also closely watched the handling of the \"Trent\" Affair in late 1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with Britain. Seward\\'s main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy. He was successful after indicating to London and Paris that Washington would declare war on them if they supported Richmond.\\nAssassination.\\nJohn Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President. When Booth learned of the Lincolns\\' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford\\'s Theatre. Lincoln and his wife attended the play \"Our American Cousin\" on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.\\nOn April 14, 1865, hours before he was assassinated, Lincoln signed legislation establishing the United States Secret Service, and, at 10:15 in the evening, Booth entered the back of Lincoln\\'s theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln\\'s head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln\\'s guest, Major Henry Rathbone, momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. After being attended by Doctor Charles Leale and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for eight hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 in the morning on April 15. Stanton saluted and said, \"Now he belongs to the ages.\" Lincoln\\'s body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin, which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers. President Johnson was sworn in later that same day.\\nTwo weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia, and was mortally shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett and died on April 26. Secretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken alive, so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed. After a brief interview, Stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge.\\nFuneral and burial.\\nThe late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. The caskets containing Lincoln\\'s body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the \"Lincoln Special\" funeral train. The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. Poet Walt Whitman composed \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom\\'d\" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln. African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \"Moses\". In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war. Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death. Lincoln\\'s body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb.\\nReligious and philosophical beliefs.\\nAs a young man, Lincoln was a religious skeptic. He was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoting and praising it. He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others. He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. Throughout his public career, Lincoln often quoted Scripture. His three most famous speeches—the House Divided Speech, the Gettysburg Address, and his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to Providence and quotes from Scripture.\\nIn the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power. With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended First Presbyterian Church with his wife beginning in 1852.\\nIn the 1850s, Lincoln asserted his belief in \"providence\" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace. After Willie\\'s death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war\\'s severity. He wrote at this time that God \"could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\"\\nLincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches. By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky: This spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in American history, and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least. Lincoln explains therein that the cause, purpose, and result of the war was God\\'s will. Lincoln\\'s frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.\\nHealth.\\nLincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria. He took blue mass pills, which contained mercury, to treat constipation. It is unknown to what extent that might have resulted in mercury poisoning.\\nSeveral claims have been made that Lincoln\\'s health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs of Lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. It is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.\\nLegacy.\\nRepublican values.\\nLincoln\\'s redefinition of \"republican values\" has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick Diggins, Harry V. Jaffa, Vernon Burton, Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz. Lincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the Constitution, which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse. Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech. Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.\\nHis position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state. Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.\\nAs a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to Jacksonian democrats. Lincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the Jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise. Nevertheless, Lincoln admired Andrew Jackson\\'s steeliness as well as his patriotism. According to historian Sean Wilentz:\\nWilliam C. Harris found that Lincoln\\'s \"reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.\" James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.\" Randall concludes that \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called \\'radicalism\\' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\"\\nReunification of the states.\\nIn Lincoln\\'s first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\"\\nThe successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. The term \"the United States\" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (\"these United States\") and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.\\nHistorical reputation.\\nIn surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948, the top three presidents are Lincoln, Washington, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, although the order varies. Between 1999 and 2011, Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan have been the top-ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys, according to Gallup. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington.\\nLincoln\\'s assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln\\'s name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. Historians have said he was \"a classical liberal\" in the 19th-century sense. Allen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a \"classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to Mill, Cobden, and Bright\", whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office.\\nSociologist Barry Schwartz argues that Lincoln\\'s American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s), when he emerged as one of America\\'s most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\\nUnion nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, \"helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\" In the New Deal era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state.\\nSchwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with \"a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.\" During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world\\'s disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.\" Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\" However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln\\'s symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.\" He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.\\nIn the Cold War years, Lincoln\\'s image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes. He had long been known as the Great Emancipator, but, by the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by Lerone Bennett Jr., denied that Lincoln deserved that title. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them. Defenders of Lincoln, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. Dirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett seriously, pointing to his \"narrow political agenda and faulty research\".\\nBy the 1970s, Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neo-Confederates such as Mel Bradford, who denounced his treatment of the white South—for his intense nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, his acting on Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. Lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world.\\nBarry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln\\'s image suffered \"erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule\" in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were \"content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason\".\\nIn the 21st century, President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the Lincoln Bible for his inaugural ceremonies. Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.\\nMemory and memorials.\\nLincoln\\'s portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill. His likeness also appears on many postage stamps. While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. He was the first of five presidents to do so.\\nHe has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of Nebraska. The United States Navy is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.\\nThe Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nation\\'s capital and is one of the top five visited National Park Service sites in the country. Ford\\'s Theatre, among the top sites in Washington, D.C., is across the street from Petersen House, where Lincoln died. Memorials in Springfield, Illinois, include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln\\'s home, and his tomb. A portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on Mount Rushmore, which receives about 3\\xa0million visitors a year. An stands in Lincoln Park Chicago, with recastings given as diplomatic gifts standing in Parliament Square, London, and Parque Lincoln, Mexico City.\\nIn 2019, Congress officially dedicated room H-226 in the US Capitol to Abraham Lincoln. The room is located off of National Statuary Hall and previously served as the post office of the House while then-Representative Abraham Lincoln served in Congress from 1847-1849.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"308\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308\" title=\"Aristotle\">\\nAristotle\\n\\nAristotle (; \"Aristotélēs\", ; 384–322\\xa0BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy within the Lyceum and the wider Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology, and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\\nLittle is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato\\'s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.\\nAristotle\\'s views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. Some of Aristotle\\'s zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply \"The Philosopher\", while the poet Dante called him \"the master of those who know\". His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan.\\nAristotle\\'s influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. Aristotle has been called the father of logic, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, natural law, scientific method, rhetoric, psychology, realism, criticism, individualism, teleology, and meteorology.\\nLife.\\nIn general, the details of Aristotle\\'s life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.\\nAristotle was born in 384\\xa0BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, about 55\\xa0km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki. His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. While he was young, Aristotle learned about biology and medical information, which was taught by his father. Both of Aristotle\\'s parents died when he was about thirteen, and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. Although little information about Aristotle\\'s childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.\\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato\\'s Academy. He probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" [παθείν μαθεĩν]. Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47\\xa0BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy\\'s direction after control passed to Plato\\'s nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died. Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermias\\'s adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander.\\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During Aristotle\\'s time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle\\'s own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\". By 335\\xa0BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus. If the \"Suda\" an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages is accurate, he may also have had an \"erômenos\", Palaephatus of Abydus.\\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include \"Physics\", \"Metaphysics\", \"Nicomachean Ethics\", \"Politics\", \"On the Soul\" and \"Poetics\". Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre.\"\\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander\\'s relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander\\'s death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death. Following Alexander\\'s death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322\\xa0BC, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother\\'s family estate in Chalcis, on Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\" – a reference to Athens\\'s trial and execution of Socrates. He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.\\nSpeculative philosophy.\\nLogic.\\nWith the \"Prior Analytics\", Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic. Kant stated in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.\\n\"Organon\".\\nWhat is today called \"Aristotelian logic\" with its types of syllogism (methods of logical argument), Aristotle himself would have labelled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean \"dialectics\". Most of Aristotle\\'s work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the \"Organon\" around 40 BC by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers. The books are:\\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle\\'s writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the \"Categories,\" the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in \"On Interpretation\", to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the \"Analytics\") and dialectics (in the \"Topics\" and \"Sophistical Refutations\"). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory \"stricto sensu\": the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The \"Rhetoric\" is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the \"Topics\".\\nMetaphysics.\\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle\\'s works to the treatise we know by the name \"Metaphysics\". Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (\"theoretikē\") philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his \"Metaphysics\" (1026a16):\\nSubstance.\\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance (\"ousia\") and essence (\"to ti ên einai\", \"the what it was to be\") in his \"Metaphysics\" (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called hylomorphism. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers, etc., or whatever constitutes the \"potential\" house, while the form of the substance is the \"actual\" house, namely \\'covering for bodies and chattels\\' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.\\nImmanent realism.\\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle\\'s philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle\\'s ontology places the universal (\"katholou\") in particulars (\"kath\\' hekaston\"), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what phenomena are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.\\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When one looks at an apple, for example, one sees an apple, and one can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, one can place an apple next to a book, so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.\\nPotentiality and actuality.\\nConcerning the nature of change (\"kinesis\") and its causes, as he outlines in his \"Physics\" and \"On Generation and Corruption (\"319b–320a), he distinguishes coming-to-be (\"genesis\", also translated as \\'generation\\') from:\\nComing-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (\"dynamis\") and actuality (\"entelecheia\") in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (\"dynamei\") a plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either \\'act\\' (\"poiein\") or \\'be acted upon\\' (\"paschein\"), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (\"telos\") is the principle of every change, and potentiality exists for the sake of the end, actuality, accordingly, is the end. Referring then to the previous example, it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.\\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.\\nEpistemology.\\nAristotle\\'s immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction, whereas Plato relies on deduction from \"a priori\" principles.\\nNatural philosophy.\\nAristotle\\'s \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences. In Aristotle\\'s terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle\\'s work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". However, his use of the term \"science\" carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (\"dianoia\") is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (\"Metaphysics\" 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.\\nPhysics.\\nFive elements.\\nIn his \"On Generation and Corruption\", Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, earth, water, air, and fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle\\'s scheme added the heavenly aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets.\\nMotion.\\nAristotle describes two kinds of motion: \"violent\" or \"unnatural motion\", such as that of a thrown stone, in the \"Physics\" (254b10), and \"natural motion\", such as of a falling object, in \"On the Heavens\" (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address friction. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation\\nincorrect in modern physics.\\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.\\nIn the \"Physics\" (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:;\\nAristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible. Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\" that Aristotle\\'s concept of force was basically qualitative, but other authors reject this.\\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle\\'s theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they displace enough water; floating depends in Archimedes\\' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not, as Aristotle thought, its elementary composition.\\nAristotle\\'s writings on motion remained influential until the Early Modern period. John Philoponus (in the Middle Ages) and Galileo are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle\\'s claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. A contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli, who argues that Aristotle\\'s physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the Earth\\'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.\\nNewton\\'s \"forced\" motion corresponds to Aristotle\\'s \"violent\" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle\\'s assumption that the agent\\'s effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower\\'s hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus.\\nFour causes.\\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term \"aitia\" is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.\\nOptics.\\nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in \"Problems\", book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun\\'s image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.\\nChance and spontaneity.\\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things, \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people\\'s moral choices.\\nAstronomy.\\nIn astronomy, Aristotle refuted Democritus\\'s claim that the Milky Way was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun\\'s rays,\" pointing out correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\"\\nGeology and natural sciences.\\nAristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations. He stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person\\'s lifetime.\\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change, including \"lakes that had dried up\" and \"deserts that had become watered by rivers\", giving as examples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer, and \"the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.\"\\'\\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology (including his major writings \"Meteorologica\"). For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (\"I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again.\")\\nBiology.\\nEmpirical research.\\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically, and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. His data in \"History of Animals\", \"Generation of Animals\", \"Movement of Animals\", and \"Parts of Animals\" are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas. His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on botany have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.\\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the catfish, electric ray, and frogfish in detail, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus. His description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark.\\nHe notes that an animal\\'s structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the heron, which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet. Darwin, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution. Aristotle\\'s writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles\\'s materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results. To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor, or that one kind can change into another, or that kinds can become extinct.\\nScientific style.\\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. He used the ancient Greek term \"pepeiramenoi\" to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection. In \"Generation of Animals\", he finds a fertilized hen\\'s egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo\\'s heart beating inside.\\nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.; This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle\\'s biology is scientific.\\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.\\nClassification of living things.\\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals, arranging these in the \"History of Animals\" in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the \"scala naturae\", with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above plants, and these in turn were above minerals. He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution. Philosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy, but zoologists who studied this question recently think otherwise. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.\\nPsychology.\\nSoul.\\nAristotle\\'s psychology, given in his treatise \"On the Soul\" (\"peri psychēs\"), posits three kinds of soul (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the \"nous\" (intellect) and \"logos\" (reason).\\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle\\'s division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.\\nIn \"On the Soul\", Aristotle famously criticizes Plato\\'s theory of the soul and develops his own in response to Plato\\'s. The first criticism is against Plato\\'s view of the soul in the \"Timaeus\" that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies. 20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle\\'s interpretation of Plato and maintained that he had misunderstood Plato. Today\\'s scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle\\'s interpretation and have warmed up to it. Aristotle\\'s other criticism is that Plato\\'s view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis-matched; in principle, Aristotle alleges, any soul can go with any body, according to Plato\\'s theory. Aristotle\\'s claim that the soul is the form of a living being is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation.\\nMemory.\\nAccording to Aristotle in \"On the Soul\", memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past. In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian , and thinking.\\nAristotle uses the term \\'memory\\' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences, both for previous experience and present experience.\\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed. Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression. Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.\\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his laws of association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.\\nDreams.\\nAristotle describes sleep in \"On Sleep and Wakefulness\". Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently, unless they are weary.\\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner. Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then looks away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience. During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person. This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature. In \"De Anima\" iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, \"phantasia\".\\nOne component of Aristotle\\'s theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences. Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.\\nPractical philosophy.\\nAristotle\\'s practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.\\nEthics.\\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, most notably including the \"Nicomachean Ethics\".\\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (\"ergon\") of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the \"psuchē\" (\"soul\") in accordance with reason (\"logos\"). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, \"eudaimonia\", generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well-being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (\"ēthikē\" \"aretē\"), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.\\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (\"phronesis\") and their intellect (\"nous\") can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.\\nPolitics.\\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled \"Politics\". Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\". He famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and argued that humanity\\'s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle\\'s conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.\\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle\\'s understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (\"polis\") which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (\"koinōnia\"). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences\".\\nIn \"Protrepticus\", the character \\'Aristotle\\' states:\\nAs Plato\\'s disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and, following the outline of certain ideas from Plato\\'s \"Statesman\", he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:\\nTo illustrate this approach, Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting, albeit textually described, where the democratic principle of \"one voter–one vote\" is combined with the oligarchic \"merit-weighted voting\"; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see.\\nEconomics.\\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought, especially to thought in the Middle Ages. In \"Politics\", Aristotle addresses the city, property, and trade. His response to criticisms of private property, in Lionel Robbins\\'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements. Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from human nature. In \"Politics\", Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money. Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or silver.\\nAristotle\\'s discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a profit. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.\\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\". He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".\\nRhetoric and poetics.\\nAristotle\\'s \"Rhetoric\" proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: \"ethos\" (an appeal to the speaker\\'s character), \"pathos\" (an appeal to the audience\\'s emotion), and \"logos\" (an appeal to logical reasoning). He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: epideictic (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), forensic (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and deliberative (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue). Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs: \"enthymeme\" (proof by syllogism) and \"paradeigma\" (proof by example).\\nAristotle writes in his \"Poetics\" that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of \"mimesis\" (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. He applies the term \"mimesis\" both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist\\'s intention and contends that the audience\\'s realisation of the \"mimesis\" is vital to understanding the work itself. Aristotle states that \"mimesis\" is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.\\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle\\'s \"Poetics\" originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes \"Poetics\" with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic. Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop.\\nViews on women.\\nAristotle\\'s analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. The biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction, which changes her body temperature, which in turn makes her, in Aristotle\\'s view, incapable of participating in political life. On this ground, proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women\\'s happiness as he did to men\\'s, and commented in his \"Rhetoric\" that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.\\nInfluence.\\nMore than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in \"The Classical Tradition\", observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle\\'s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\".\\nOn his successor, Theophrastus.\\nAristotle\\'s pupil and successor, Theophrastus, wrote the \"History of Plants\", a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as carpel from \"carpos\", fruit, and pericarp, from \"pericarpion\", seed chamber.\\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.\\nOn later Greek philosophers.\\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle\\'s work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle\\'s students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle\\'s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter\\'s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle\\'s geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men\\'s common property?\"\\nOn Hellenistic science.\\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle\\'s ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.\\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. Ernst Mayr states that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\"\\nOn Byzantine scholars.\\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century. John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle\\'s views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. Philoponus questioned Aristotle\\'s teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations.\\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.\\nOn the medieval Islamic world.\\nAristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. Alkindus greatly admired Aristotle\\'s philosophy, and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future philosophers. Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\". The title was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.\\nOn medieval Europe.\\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the \"Organon\" made by Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona, and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke. After the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his \"Summa Theologica\", working from Moerbeke\\'s translations and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher\", the demand for Aristotle\\'s writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, Peter Abelard, and John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic.\\nThe medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having\\nA cautionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king\\'s seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman\\'s charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher\\'s male intellect. Artists such as Hans Baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.\\nThe Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in \"The Divine Comedy\":\\nBesides Dante\\'s fellow poets, the classical figure that most influenced the \"Comedy\" is Aristotle. Dante built up the philosophy of the \"Comedy\" with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of Albert Magnus. Dante even acknowledges Aristotle\\'s influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno\\'s structure by citing the \"Nicomachean Ethics\".\\nOn medieval Judaism.\\nMoses Maimonides (considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism) adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his \"Guide for the Perplexed\" on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Maimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived, and styled him as the \"chief of the philosophers\". Also, in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon, Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are \"sufficient by themselves and [superior] to all that were written before them. His intellect, Aristotle\\'s is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, there being no level higher\".\\nOn Early Modern scientists.\\nIn the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body\\'s heat, as Aristotle thought. Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle\\'s physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.\\nOn 18th/19th-century thinkers.\\nThe 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (\"natural slaves\"), and the natural superiority (virtue, \"arete\") of others. It was Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.\\nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle\\'s logic, but decided \"to go under, over, and beyond\" it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book \"The Laws of Thought\". This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.\\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species\\', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles.\\nJames Joyce\\'s favoured philosopher was Aristotle, whom he considered to be \"the greatest thinker of all times\". Samuel Taylor Coleridge said: Everybody is born either a Platonist or an Aristotelian. Ayn Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A\\'s\"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. She also regarded Aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers.\\nKarl Marx considered Aristotle to be the \"greatest thinker of antiquity\", and called him a \"giant thinker\", a \"genius\", and \"the great scholar\".\\nModern rejection and rehabilitation.\\nDuring the 20th century, Aristotle\\'s work was widely criticized. The philosopher Bertrand Russell\\nargued that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell called Aristotle\\'s ethics \"repulsive\", and labelled his logic \"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.\\nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their senses. In 1985, the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in \"pure seventeenth century\" tones that Aristotle had assembled \"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility\".\\nBy the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that \"In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.\" Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans. Kukkonen observed, too, that \"that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander\" remained current, as in the 2004 film \"Alexander\", while the \"firm rules\" of Aristotle\\'s theory of drama have ensured a role for the \"Poetics\" in Hollywood.\\nBiologists continue to be interested in Aristotle\\'s thinking. Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle\\'s biology, while Niko Tinbergen\\'s four questions, based on Aristotle\\'s four causes, are used to analyse animal behaviour; they examine function, phylogeny, mechanism, and ontogeny.\\nSurviving works.\\nCorpus Aristotelicum.\\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle\\'s lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle\\'s school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker\\'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (\"Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica\", Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.\\nLoss and preservation.\\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era. His writings are divisible into two groups: the \"exoteric\", intended for the public, and the \"esoteric\", for use within the Lyceum school. Aristotle\\'s \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication. Cicero\\'s description of Aristotle\\'s literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes. A major question in the history of Aristotle\\'s works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones now possessed came to be found. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle\\'s school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.\\nLegacy.\\nDepictions.\\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder, Justus van Gent, Raphael, Paolo Veronese, Jusepe de Ribera, Rembrandt, and Francesco Hayez over the centuries. Among the best-known depictions is Raphael\\'s fresco \"The School of Athens\", in the Vatican\\'s Apostolic Palace, where the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural vanishing point, reflecting their importance. Rembrandt\\'s \"Aristotle with a Bust of Homer\", too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones writes, \"this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.\"\\nEponyms.\\nThe Aristotle Mountains in Antarctica are named after Aristotle. He was the first person known to conjecture, in his book \"Meteorology\", the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and called it \"Antarctica\". Aristoteles is a crater on the Moon bearing the classical form of Aristotle\\'s name.\\nFurther reading.\\nThe secondary literature on Aristotle is vast. The following is only a small selection.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"309\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309\" title=\"An American in Paris\">\\nAn American in Paris\\n\\nAn American in Paris is a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer George Gershwin first performed in 1928. It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the \"\".\\nGershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta, saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in Carnegie Hall, with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic. It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his Concerto in F following the earlier success of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" (1924). He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work\\'s premiere. He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer Deems Taylor.\\nBackground.\\nAlthough the story is likely apocryphal, Gershwin is said to have been attracted by Maurice Ravel\\'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he could not teach him, saying, \"Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?\"\\nGershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour. To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel\\'s friend Robert Schmitz, a pianist Ravel had met during the war, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $10,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.\\nGershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during a party held for Ravel\\'s birthday by Éva Gauthier. Ravel\\'s tour reignited Gershwin\\'s desire to return to Paris, which he and his brother Ira did after meeting Ravel. Ravel\\'s high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Nadia Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris. Yet after he played for her, she told him she could not teach him. Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students: \"What could I give you that you haven\\'t already got?\" This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them Ezra Pound, W. B. Yeats, Ernest Hemingway, and artist Pablo Picasso.\\nComposition.\\nGershwin based \"An American in Paris\" on a melodic fragment called \"Very Parisienne\", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. Gershwin called it \"a rhapsodic ballet\"; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.\\nGershwin explained in \"Musical America\", \"My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.\"\\nThe piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose ABA format. Gershwin\\'s first A episode introduces the two main \"walking\" themes in the \"Allegretto grazioso\" and develops a third theme in the \"Subito con brio\". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section\\'s \"Andante ma con ritmo deciso\" introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness. The \"Allegro\" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. \"Moderato con grazia\" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the \"walking\" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final \"Grandioso\".\\nResponse.\\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch\\'s interpretation at the world premiere of \"An American in Paris\". He stated that Damrosch\\'s sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with \"a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.\"\\nCritics believed that \"An American in Paris\" was better crafted than Gershwin\\'s Concerto in F. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck, Richard Wagner, or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics:\\nInstrumentation.\\n\"An American in Paris\" was originally scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B-flat, bass clarinet in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B-flat, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, triangle, wood block, ratchet, cymbals, low and high tom-toms, xylophone, glockenspiel, celesta, 4 taxi horns labeled as A, B, C, and D with circles around them, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone (all doubling soprano and alto saxophones), and strings. Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C, and D, it had been Gershwin\\'s intention to use the notes A4, B4, D5, and A3. It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C, and D with circles, he was referring to the four horns, and not the notes that they played.\\nA major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments: alto, tenor and baritone; the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments. This became the standard performing edition until 2000, when Gershwin specialist Jack Gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of \"An American in Paris\", working directly from Gershwin\\'s original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin\\'s soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson\\'s revision. Gibbons\\' restored orchestration of \"An American in Paris\" was performed at London\\'s Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000, by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian.\\nWilliam Daly arranged the score for piano solo; this was published by New World Music in 1929.\\nPreservation status.\\nOn September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin\\'s true intent. It was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin\\'s composition process.\\nThe score to \"An American in Paris\" was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete, but \"An American in Paris\" was planned to be an early volume in the series.\\nTwo urtext editions of the work were published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson were withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music were re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.\\nOn September 9, 2017, The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by Mark Clague, director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan. This performance was of the original 1928 orchestration.\\nRecordings.\\n\"An American in Paris\" has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929 with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D, and a lower A.\\nThe radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937, Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which \"An American in Paris,\" also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.\\nArthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.\\nIn 1945, Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the piece for RCA Victor, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.\\nThe Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin\\'s original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.\\nHarry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album \"One Night Stand,\" recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago (Columbia GL 522 and CL 522).\\nUse in film.\\nIn 1951, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film, \"An American in Paris\", featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar, and numerous other awards, the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the \"An American in Paris\" symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green), costing $500,000.\\nExternal links.\\n \\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"316\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316\" title=\"Academy Award for Best Production Design\">\\nAcademy Award for Best Production Design\\n\\nThe Academy Award for Best Production Design recognizes achievement for art direction in film.

The awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry worldwide. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy\\'s voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy, officially called the \"Academy Award of Merit\", although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the \"Oscar\". The statuette, depicting a knight rendered in the Art Deco style, was originally sculpted by Los Angeles artist George Stanley from a design sketch by art director Cedric Gibbons.\\nThe 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide. It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards; its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards. A total of 3,140 Oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in 1929.\\nHistory.\\nThe first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people.\\nThe post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night\\'s ceremony was $5 ($ at 2020 prices). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15\\xa0minutes.\\nFor this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier. For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00\\xa0pm on the night of the awards. In 1940, the \"Los Angeles Times\" announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the following year the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.\\nThe term \"Oscar\" is a registered trademark of the AMPAS; however, in the Italian language, it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony, regardless of which field.\\nMilestones.\\nThe first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in \"The Last Command\" and \"The Way of All Flesh\". He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.\\nAt the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as Best International Feature Film, was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\\nPerhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, \"Isn\\'t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?\" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel\\'s appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show\\'s producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show\\'s business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler\\'s wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.\\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\\nFrom 1973 to 2020, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture. For 2021, this tradition was broken as the ceremony ended with the Academy Award for Best Actor.\\nTraditionally, the previous year\\'s winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year\\'s winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.\\nOn February 9, 2020, \"Parasite\" became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the award ceremony of 92nd Academy Awards.\\nTom Hanks announced at the 2020 Oscar Ceremony, the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on December 14, 2020. The museum development started in 2017 under Kerry Brougher, but is now led by Bill Kramer. The industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture, the art &amp; science of film making, exhibiting trailblazing directors, actors, film-makers, sound editors and more, and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like Dorothy\\'s Ruby Red Slippers.\\nThe 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021, was held on April 25, 2021, after it was postponed from its original February 28, 2021, schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. As with two previous ceremonies, there was no host. The ceremony was broadcast on ABC. It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California for the 19th consecutive year, along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles. Because of the virus impact on films and TV industries, Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony, streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible, though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return.\\nOscar statuette.\\nAcademy Award of Merit.\\nThe best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base, it is 13.5\\xa0in (34.3\\xa0cm) tall, weighs 8.5\\xa0lb (3.856\\xa0kg), and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.\\nSculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Cedric Gibbons\\' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold. Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award\\'s statuettes. From 1983 to 2015, approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens &amp; Company. It would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes. In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to Walden, New York-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry. While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal. Cast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn, New York–based Epner Technology. The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months. R.S. Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating.\\nNaming.\\nThe Academy officially adopted the name \"Oscar\" for the trophies in 1939. However, the origin of the nickname is disputed.\\nOne biography of Bette Davis, who was a president of the Academy in 1941, claims she named the award after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. A frequently mentioned originator is Margaret Herrick, the Academy executive director, who, when she first saw the award in 1931, said the statuette reminded her of \"Uncle Oscar\", a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce.\\nColumnist Sidney Skolsky, who was present during Herrick\\'s naming in 1931, wrote that \"Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette \\'Oscar\\'.\" The Academy credits Skolsky with \"the first confirmed newspaper reference\" to \"Oscar\" in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year\\'s 6th Academy Awards. The 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of \"Oscar\": a \"Time\" magazine story. In the ceremonies that year, Walt Disney was the first to thank the Academy for his \"Oscar\" during his acceptance speech.\\nBruce Davis, in preparing a history of the awards for his book \"The Academy and the Award\", found that the term \"Oscar\" had come from Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary within the Academy when the award was first introduced, as she had been in charge of pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore\\'s brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar the two knew in Chicago, who Einar described as \"stood straight and tall\".\\nIn 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the likely first public mention of the name \"Oscar\", in journalist Relman Morin\\'s column \"Cinematters\" in the \"Los Angeles Evening Post-Record\" on December 5, 1933. As the award did not take place that year, Relman Morin wrote: \"What\\'s happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of \"Oscar\" the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this.\" This information changes the question of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly name the name.\\nEngraving.\\nTo prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor\\'s Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.\\nOwnership of Oscar statuettes.\\nPrior to 1950, Oscar statuettes were (and remain) the property of the recipient. Since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.\\nIn 1989, Michael Todd\\'s grandson tried to sell Todd\\'s Best Picture Oscar for his 1956 production of \"Around the World in 80 Days\" to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.\\nIn 1992, Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" to auction to raise money for his wife\\'s medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first-ever Oscar to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992 for $60,500 ($ today). Russell defended his action, saying, \"I don\\'t know why anybody would be critical. My wife\\'s health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn\\'t.\"\\nIn December 2011, Orson Welles\\' 1941 Oscar for \"Citizen Kane\" (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy. On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 ($ today).\\nSome buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.\\nOther awards presented by the Academy.\\nIn addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):\\nThe Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting.\\nNomination.\\nFrom 2004 to 2020, the Academy Award nomination results were announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February. In 2021, the nominees were announced in March. In 2022, the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since 2003.\\nVoters.\\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 .\\nAcademy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy\\'s composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.\\nAll AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.\\nNew membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.\\nIn 2012, the results of a study conducted by the \"Los Angeles Times\" were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS\\' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).\\nIn May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.\\nRules.\\nAccording to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories). Additionally, the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6\\xa0pm and 10\\xa0pm local time.\\nFor example, the 2009 Best Picture winner, \"The Hurt Locker\", was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards, as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.\\nRule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40\\xa0minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24\\xa0frame/s or 48\\xa0frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels. Since the 90th Academy Awards, presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of \"\", an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN, in that category in 2017. The Academy\\'s announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.\\nThe Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country\\'s official selection.\\nThe Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and New York City during the previous calendar year, or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list (regardless of any public exhibition or distribution), or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country\\'s official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. Additionally, a film must have been reviewed by a critic from \"The New York Times\", \"Time Out New York\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", or \"LA Weekly\".\\nProducers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.\\nAwards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead of covering one year starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in \"either\" Los Angeles County \"or\" New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10\\xa0pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.\\nIn late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially. In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.\\nIn most categories, the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members. Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting. Since 2013, re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects.\\nFilm companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders. For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee \"The Hurt Locker\" was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (\"The Hurt Locker\" eventually won).\\nAcademy Screening Room.\\nThe Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars, though DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a watermarking fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via Apple TV and Roku players. The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.\\nIn 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room. Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform. The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.\\nAwards ceremonies.\\nTelecast.\\nThe major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\\nThe Academy Awards is the world\\'s longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all-time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when ABC took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970. NBC regained the rights for five years then ABC resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028. The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since 2004, to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the NCAA basketball tournament, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In 1976 and 1977, ABC\\'s regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC\\'s NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most Emmys in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award\\'s own launch in 1949.\\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00\\xa0pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, since the 1999 ceremonies, it was moved to Sundays at 8:30\\xa0pm ET/5:30\\xa0pm PT. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier. For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers\\' fatigue with the film industry\\'s long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with National Football League playoff games. In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.\\nOriginally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.\\nIn 1993, an \"In Memoriam\" segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members. This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a \"popularity contest\" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject\\'s cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.\\nIn terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15\\xa0minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes. In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners\\' acceptance speeches must not run past 45\\xa0seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed \"the single most hated thing on the show\" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion. In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners\\' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker. During the 2018 ceremony, host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become, by announcing that he would give a brand-new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night (a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for \"Phantom Thread\"). \"The Wall Street Journal\" analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows: 14 on song performances; 25 on the hosts\\' speeches; 38 on prerecorded clips; and 78 on the awards themselves, broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement, 24 on winners walking to the stage, and 30 on their acceptance speeches.\\nAlthough still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped; the 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, \"Variety\" reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions. In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.\\nTV ratings.\\nHistorically, the telecast\\'s viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25\\xa0million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, the year of \"Titanic\", which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8\\xa0million in the US, a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years. The 76th Academy Awards ceremony, in which \"\" (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368\\xa0million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture, drew 43.56\\xa0million viewers. The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date, however, was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture \"Midnight Cowboy\") which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.\\nBy contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critical acclaim those films have received. The 78th Academy Awards which awarded low-budget independent film \"Crash\" (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4\\xa0million) generated an audience of 38.64\\xa0million with a household rating of 22.91%. In 2008, the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76\\xa0million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards. The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (\"No Country for Old Men\").\\nWhereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6\\xa0million viewers, the 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4\\xa0million. That is the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974.\\nArchive.\\nThe Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the 1949 Oscars and material on many prior ceremonies, along with ancillary material related to more recent shows. Copies are held in a variety of film, video, and digital formats.\\nVenues.\\nIn 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\\nGrauman\\'s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy\\'s headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.\\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood\\'s Pantages Theatre. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre, after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California, in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine.\\nIn 2002, Hollywood\\'s Dolby Theatre (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation\\'s current venue.\\nAwards of Merit categories.\\nCurrent categories.\\nIn the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.\\nIn August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.\\nFollowing dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals (among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category) that the Academy had announced but did not implement.\\nProposed categories.\\nThe Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories. To date, the following categories have been proposed:\\nSpecial categories.\\nThe Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole. They are not always presented on an annual basis.\\nCriticism.\\nAccusations of commercialism.\\nDue to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the \"Oscar season\". This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality. William Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as \"the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself\".\\nTim Dirks, editor of AMC\\'s filmsite.org, has written of the Academy Awards:\\nA recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against \"Zero Dark Thirty\" suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that \"Lincoln\" distorts history.\\nAccusations of bias.\\nTypical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term \"Oscar bait\" was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring \"Oscar bait\" over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.\\nAllegations of a lack of diversity.\\nThe Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees. This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which shows us that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing. Due to a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of high-profile Oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals, as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters. The 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, based on activists\\' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias. In response, the Academy initiated \"historic\" changes in membership by 2020. Media critics find the Academy\\'s efforts to address its racial, gender, and national biases are merely distractions. Some question whether the Academy\\'s definition of \"merit\" is unjust and disempowering for BIPOC and non-Americans.\\nSymbolism or sentimentalization.\\nActing prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity, to make up for a \"snub\" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a \"career honor\" to recognize a distinguished nominee\\'s entire body of work.\\nRecognition of streaming media film.\\nFollowing the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film \"Roma\" had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar. The United States Department of Justice, having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy. Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.\\n2022 Will Smith and Chris Rock slapping incident.\\nDuring the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith\\'s shaved head, with a \"G.I. Jane\" reference. Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face, then returned to his seat and told Rock, twice, to \"Keep my wife\\'s name out [of] your fucking mouth!\" While later accepting the Best Actor award for \"King Richard\", Smith apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock. Rock decided not to press charges against Smith. On April 8, 2022, the Academy made an announcement on a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith is banned from the Oscars for 10 years in result from the slap.\\nRefusals of the award.\\nSome winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for \"The Informer\"). Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers\\' Guild. Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.\\nGeorge C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for \"Patton\") at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony. Scott described it as a \"meat parade\", saying, \"I don\\'t want any part of it.\"\\nThe third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972\\'s \"The Godfather\"), citing the film industry\\'s discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was booing and cheering by the audience.\\nDisqualifications.\\nSix films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony:\\nOne film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:\\nOne film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:\\nGender segregation.\\nSome advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards and Tony Awards. Though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated.\\nAssociated events.\\nThe following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards:\\nPresenter and performer gifts.\\nIt has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years, these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners. The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014, the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000. The value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.\\nOscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, videophones, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, weight-loss gummie candy and up to $25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich. Some of the gifts have even had a \"risque\" element to them; in 2014, the adult products retailer Adam &amp; Eve had a \"Secret Room Gifting Suite\". Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag, Carolyn Hennesy, Kate Linder, Chris Mulkey, Jim O\\'Heir, and John Salley.\\nTelevision ratings and advertisement prices.\\nFrom 2006 onwards, results are Live+SD; all previous years are live viewing.\\nNotable highest wins and nominees.\\nBy franchises.\\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations (5 or more):\\nThe following winners received multiple awards (2 or more):\\nBy people.\\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations (5 or more):\\nThe following winners received multiple awards including honorary or non-competitive (3 or more):\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"325\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=325\" title=\"Action Film\">\\nAction Film\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"330\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330\" title=\"Actrius\">\\nActrius\\n\\nActresses (Catalan: Actrius) is a 1997 Catalan language Spanish drama film produced and directed by Ventura Pons and based on the award-winning stage play \"E.R.\" by Josep Maria Benet i Jornet. The film has no male actors, with all roles played by females. The film was produced in 1996. \\nSynopsis.\\nIn order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress Empar Ribera, young actress (Mercè Pons) interviews three established actresses who had been the Ribera\\'s pupils: the international diva Glòria Marc (Núria Espert), the television star Assumpta Roca (Rosa Maria Sardà), and dubbing director Maria Caminal (Anna Lizaran).\\nRecognition.\\nScreenings.\\n\"Actrius\" screened in 2001 at the Grauman\\'s Egyptian Theatre in an American Cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director. The film had first screened at the same location in 1998. It was also shown at the 1997 Stockholm International Film Festival.\\nReception.\\nIn \"Movie - Film - Review\", Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were \"competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers\", the film \"is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident\". Noting that there were \"occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness\", they did not \"justify comparisons to \"All About Eve\"\", and were \"insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with \"Rashomon\"\". He also wrote that \"The Guardian\" called the film a \"slow, stuffy chamber-piece\", and that \"The Evening Standard\" stated the film\\'s \"best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome\\'s composed veneers\". MRQE wrote \"This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story.\"\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"332\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332\" title=\"Animalia (book)\">\\nAnimalia (book)\\n\\nAnimalia is an illustrated children\\'s book by Graeme Base.

TAI is a weighted average of the time kept by over 450 atomic clocks in over 80 national laboratories worldwide. It is a continuous scale of time, without leap seconds, and it is the principal realisation of Terrestrial Time (with a fixed offset of epoch). It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth\\'s surface and which has leap seconds.\\nUTC deviates from TAI by a number of whole seconds. , when another leap second was put into effect, UTC is currently exactly 37 seconds behind TAI. The 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.\\nTAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both Julian days and the Gregorian calendar are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due primarily to the slowing rotation of the Earth.\\nOperation.\\nTAI is a weighted average of the time kept by over 450 atomic clocks in over 80 national laboratories worldwide. The majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks; the International System of Units (SI) definition of the second is based on caesium. The clocks are compared using GPS signals and two-way satellite time and frequency transfer. Due to the signal averaging TAI is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock.\\nThe participating institutions each broadcast, in real time, a frequency signal with timecodes, which is their estimate of TAI. Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds. These time scales are denoted in the form \"UTC(NPL)\" in the UTC form, where \"NPL\" here identifies the National Physical Laboratory, UK. The TAI form may be denoted \"TAI(NPL)\". The latter is not to be confused with \"TA(NPL)\", which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.\\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible. This combined time scale is published monthly in \"Circular T\", and is the canonical TAI. This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC − UTC(\"k\") (equal to TAI − TAI(\"k\")) for each participating institution \"k\". The same circular also gives tables of TAI − TA(\"k\"), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.\\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T. Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised. In hindsight, it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale. Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time (TT).\\nHistory.\\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL). It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The United States Naval Observatory began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado on 9 October 1957.\\nThe International Time Bureau (BIH) began a time scale, Tm or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals. The BIH scale, A.1, and NBS-A were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: \"A3\" in 1964 and \"TA(BIH)\" in 1969.\\nThe SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967. From 1971 to 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures and the International Committee for Weights and Measures made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).\\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation, and the combined TAI scale, therefore, corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks. Starting from the Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at the geoid (mean sea level). Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed by about one part in a trillion. The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name \"EAL\" (\"Échelle Atomique Libre\", meaning \"Free Atomic Scale\").\\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system. All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant. TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184\\xa0s.\\nThe continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, \"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\"\\nRelation to UTC.\\nContrary to TAI, UTC is a discontinuous time scale. It is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds. Between these adjustments, it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time by a constant offset. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated UT2. Afterward, these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate UT1. This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale. The less frequent whole-second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"336\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336\" title=\"Altruism\">\\nAltruism\\n\\nAltruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for the welfare and/or happiness of other human beings or animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews. However, the object(s) of concern vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of selfishness.\\nThe word \"altruism\" was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as \"altruisme\", for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian \"altrui\", which in turn was derived from Latin \"alteri\", meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\".\\nAltruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\". In one sense, the opposite of altruism is spite; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit.\\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good. The latter are predicated upon social relationships, whilst altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether \"true\" altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification. The validity of this argument depends on whether qualify as \"benefits\".\\nThe term \"altruism\" may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with egoism, which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first. Effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.\\nThe notion of altruism.\\nThe concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.\\nScientific viewpoints.\\nAnthropology.\\nMarcel Mauss\\'s essay \"The Gift\" contains a passage called \"Note on alms\". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:\\nEvolutionary explanations.\\nIn the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping, courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.\\nTheories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.\\nSome of the proposed mechanisms are: \\nSuch explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.\\nNot every single instance of altruistic behavior necessarily leads to an increase of inclusive fitness since, if that was the case in the ancestral environment, then altruistic behaviors would have been selected. This also does not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment -- if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic, even if in most cases there were no benefits.\\nThe benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.\\nThe study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R. Price\\'s development of the Price equation, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as \"Dictyostelium mucoroides\". These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.\\nSelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.\\nSuch cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book \"\" and Moral Philosopher Peter Singer in his book \"A Darwinian Left\".\\nNeurobiology.\\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D\\'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable. One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy. The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.\\nIn fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-the-means\" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study\\'s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?\"\\nIn another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a University of Oregon economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: \"egoists\" and \"altruists\". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered \"egoists\" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person\\'s environment and values.\\nPsychology.\\nThe International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines \"psychological altruism\" as \"a motivational state with the goal of increasing another\\'s welfare\". Psychological altruism is contrasted with \"psychological egoism\", which refers to the motivation to increase one\\'s own welfare.\\nThere has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism. Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self. Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives: to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The \"empathy-altruism hypothesis\" basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need. Empathy is thus not selfless, since altruism works either as the way to avoid those negative, unpleasant feelings and have positive, pleasant feelings triggered by others\\' need for help, or as the way to incentive the gain of social reward or through fear to avoid social punishment by helping. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another\\'s suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.\\nIn psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person\\'s distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the \"Bystander effect\"). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.\\nMany studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness. It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.\\nStudies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others\\' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that \"a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being\".\\nPathological altruism.\\nPathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.\\nThe term \"pathological altruism\" was popularised by the book \"Pathological Altruism\".\\nExamples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one\\'s own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.\\nSociology.\\n\"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society\". The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges public sociology saying, \"The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct \\'good societies\\' is unquestionable\". This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and \"build the good society\". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims. Studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious – people imitate observed generosity of others.\\nReligious viewpoints.\\nMost, if not all, of the world\\'s religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, and Sikhism, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.\\nBuddhism.\\nAltruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. \"Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being\" (Dalai Lama).\\nStill, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: \"The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes\" (Dalai Lama).\\nIn the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.\\nJainism.\\nThe fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of \"Ahimsa\" – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev, introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.\\nJainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One\\'s unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.\\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:\\nThe \"great vows\" (Mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and \"limited vows\" (Anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.\\nThe principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become \"Siddha\" (God in Jainism). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one\\'s actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.\\nChristianity.\\nSt Thomas Aquinas interprets \\'You should love your neighbour as yourself\\' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. Considering that \"the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship\" and quotes Aristotle that \"the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves\", he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well-being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.\\nMany biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one\\'s fellowman is the same as hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other\\'s good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one\\'s own good when the other\\'s demands undermine overall well-being.\\nGerman philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, \"motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one\\'s own life and existence\". Another way is merely \"one of the many modern substitutes for love,\\xa0... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people\\'s business\". At its worst, Scheler says, \"love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.\"\\nIslam.\\nIn Islam, the concept \"īthār\" (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of \"preferring others to oneself\". For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one\\'s own concerns, where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by Allah (i.e. God) on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance of \"īthār\" lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; Islam considers those practicing \"īthār\" as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.\\nThis is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in \"īthār\" attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for Allah results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.\\nJudaism.\\nJudaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the \\'purpose of creation\\' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.\\nModern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity.\\nSikhism.\\nAltruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of \"seva\", or selfless service to the community for its own sake, is an important concept in Sikhism.\\nThe fifth Guru, Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold \"22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity\", the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity.\\nIn the late seventeenth century, Guru Gobind Singh (the tenth Guru in Sikhism), was at war with the Mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield. \"What were you doing, and why?\" asked the Guru. \"I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them\", replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, \"Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.\"\\nUnder the tutelage of the Guru, Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism, which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service.\\nHinduism.\\nIn Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or \"Manushyattva\". Giving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or \"Punya\" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or \"Paapa\" and will led them to heaven or \"Swarga\" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.\\nThe founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint \"Dhnyaneshwar Maharaj\" (1275-1296) in his \"Pasaydan\" pray to the supreme lord \"Vitthal\" for the wellbeing of all living organisms of the universe.\\nSwami Vivekananda, the legendary Hindu monk, has said -\"Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar\" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.\\nSwami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one\\'s merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.\\nHowever the very well known and popular text, the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; \"Nishkam Karma\" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.\\nPhilosophy.\\nThere exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans\\' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is ethical egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.\\nA related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one\\'s self-interest (without specifying how this affects one\\'s moral obligations).\\nEffective altruism.\\nEffective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values. It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity. Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.\\nWhile a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit. People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer, Facebook co founder Dustin Moskovitz, Cari Tuna, Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill and Toby Ord, and professional poker player Liv Boeree.\\nGenetics.\\nThe genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, and GABRB2 have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.\\nDigital altruism.\\nDigital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of reciprocity and in the belief that in the end, everyone benefits from sharing information via the Internet.\\nThis term is coined by Dr. Dana Klisanin, the founder and CEO of Evolutionary Guidance Media R&amp;D Inc., and is a recipient of the Early Career Award for Scientific Achievement in Media Psychology from the American Psychological Association\\'s Division of Media Psychology.\\nAccording to Klisanin, \"the notion that some are willing to freely reveal what they know\" is interesting.\\nTypes of digital altruism.\\nThere are three types of digital altruism: (1) \"everyday digital altruism,\" involving expedience, ease, moral engagement, and conformity; (2) \"creative digital altruism,\" involving creativity, heightened moral engagement, and cooperation; and (3) \"co-creative digital altruism\" involving creativity, moral engagement, and meta cooperative efforts.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"338\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338\" title=\"AutoRacing\">\\nAutoRacing\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"339\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339\" title=\"Ayn Rand\">\\nAyn Rand\\n\\nAlice O\\'Connor (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum; , 1905\\xa0– March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name Ayn Rand (), was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, \"The Fountainhead\". In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel \"Atlas Shrugged\". Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.\\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism. Instead, she supported \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including private property rights. Although Rand opposed libertarianism, which she viewed as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.\\nRand\\'s books have sold over 37 million copies. Her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics. Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death, academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor. Her writings have politically influenced some right-libertarians and conservatives. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.\\nLife.\\nEarly life.\\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February\\xa02, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg. She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum, a pharmacist, and Anna Borisovna (). She was twelve when the October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously. Her father\\'s business was confiscated, and the family fled to the city of Yevpatoria in Crimea, which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. After graduating high school there in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was then named), where they faced desperate conditions, occasionally nearly starving.\\nWhen Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution, she was in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University. At 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. Along with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were reinstated in the university. Rand was among these reinstated students and she completed her studies at the renamed Leningrad State University in October 1924. She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment, Rand wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work. By this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be \"Rand\", and she adopted the first name \"Ayn\" (pronounced ).\\nIn late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago. She departed on January\\xa017, 1926, and arrived in New York City on February\\xa019, 1926. Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives learning English before leaving for Hollywood, California.\\nIn Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film \"The King of Kings\" and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter. While working on \"The King of Kings\", she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O\\'Connor; the two married on April\\xa015, 1929. She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March\\xa03, 1931. She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate.\\nEarly fiction.\\nRand\\'s first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay \"Red Pawn\" to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced. Her courtroom drama \"Night of January\\xa016th\", first staged in Hollywood in 1934, reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935. Each night, a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on its vote, one of two different endings would be performed.\\nHer first novel, the semi-autobiographical \"We the Living\", was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. Initial sales were slow, and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. She adapted the story as a stage play, but the Broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.\\nRand started her next major novel, \"The Fountainhead\", in December 1935, but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella \"Anthem\". The novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word \"I\" has been forgotten and replaced with \"we\". It was published in England in 1938, but Rand could not find an American publisher at that time. As with \"We the Living\", Rand\\'s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold over 3.5\\xa0million copies.\\n\"The Fountainhead\" and political activism.\\nDuring the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband were full-time volunteers for Republican Wendell Willkie\\'s 1940 presidential campaign. This work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt, who introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and they expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to her as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\". Rand became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings, and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, \"The God of the Machine\".\\nRand\\'s first major success as a writer came in 1943 with \"The Fountainhead\", a novel about an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as \"second-handers\"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. Twelve publishers rejected it before Bobbs-Merrill Company accepted it at the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks\\' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.\\nThe success of \"The Fountainhead\" brought Rand fame and financial security. In 1943, she sold the film rights to Warner Bros. and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Producer Hal B. Wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for him included the screenplays for \"Love Letters\" and \"You Came Along\". Her contract with Wallis also allowed time for other projects, including a never-completed nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called \"The Moral Basis of Individualism\".\\nWhile working in Hollywood, Rand became involved with the anti-Communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the group\\'s behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a \"friendly witness\" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee that the 1944 film \"Song of Russia\" grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it was. She also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but was not allowed to do so. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations\\' effectiveness, Rand described the process as \"futile\".\\nAfter several delays, the film version of \"The Fountainhead\" was released in 1949. Although it used Rand\\'s screenplay with minimal alterations, she \"disliked the movie from beginning to end\" and complained about its editing, the acting and other elements.\\n\"Atlas Shrugged\" and Objectivism.\\nFollowing the publication of \"The Fountainhead\", Rand received many letters from readers, some of whom the book had influenced profoundly. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara\\'s cousin Leonard Peikoff. Initially, the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy. Later, Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel, \"Atlas Shrugged\". In 1954, her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the knowledge of their spouses.\\nPublished in 1957, \"Atlas Shrugged\" is considered Rand\\'s \"magnum opus\". She described the novel\\'s theme as \"the role of the mind in man\\'s existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest\". It advocates the core tenets of Rand\\'s philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy. The novel\\'s hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes it as stopping \"the motor of the world\" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nation\\'s wealth and achievements. The novel contains an exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.\\nDespite many negative reviews, \"Atlas Shrugged\" became an international bestseller, but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand. \"Atlas Shrugged\" was her last completed work of fiction, marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.\\nIn 1958, Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand\\'s philosophy through public lectures. He and Rand co-founded \"The Objectivist Newsletter\" (later renamed \"The Objectivist\") in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas; she later republished some of these articles in book form. Rand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand. Some described the NBI or the Objectivist movement as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair. Some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand\\'s closest followers in New York.\\nLater years.\\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities. She began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding to questions from the audience. During these appearances, she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day. These included: supporting abortion rights, opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as \"bums\"), supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as \"civilized men fighting savages\", saying European colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians, and calling homosexuality \"immoral\" and \"disgusting\", while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it. She endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for \"The Objectivist Newsletter\".\\nIn 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens, and the NBI was closed. She published an article in \"The Objectivist\" repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other \"irrational behavior in his private life\". In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.\\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, after her initial objections, allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare. During the late 1970s, her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November\\xa09, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of \"Atlas Shrugged\".\\nOn March\\xa06, 1982, Rand died of heart failure at her home in New York City. At her funeral, a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named Peikoff as her heir.\\nLiterary approach and influences.\\nRand described her approach to literature as \"romantic realism\". She wanted her fiction to present the world \"as it could be and should be\", rather than as it was. This approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters. Her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists, depicted as fit and attractive. Her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals. Rand often describes them as unattractive, and some have names that suggest negative traits, such as Wesley Mouch in \"Atlas Shrugged\".\\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature, and her stories typically have what biographer Anne Heller described as \"tight, elaborate, fast-paced plotting\". Romantic triangles are a common plot element in Rand\\'s fiction; in most of her novels and plays, the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men.\\nInfluences.\\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her favorites. She considered them to be among the \"top rank\" of Romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots. Hugo was an important influence on her writing, especially her approach to plotting. In the introduction she wrote for an English-language edition of his novel \"Ninety-Three\", Rand called him \"the greatest novelist in world literature\".\\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature, her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists and other nineteenth-century Russian writing, most notably the 1863 novel \"What Is to Be Done?\" by Nikolay Chernyshevsky. Rand\\'s experience of the Russian Revolution and early Communist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains. Beyond \"We the Living\", which is set in Russia, this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in \"The Fountainhead\", and in the destruction of the economy in \"Atlas Shrugged\".\\nRand\\'s descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios. They often follow common film editing conventions, such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close-up details, and her descriptions of women characters often take a \"male gaze\" perspective.\\nPhilosophy.\\nRand called her philosophy \"Objectivism\", describing its essence as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\". She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.\\nIn metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion. Rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism.\\nIn epistemology, Rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as \"the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man\\'s senses\". Rand rejected all claims of non-perceptual knowledge, including instinct,\\' \\'intuition,\\' \\'revelation,\\' or any form of \\'just knowing. In her \"Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology\", Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy. She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy.\\nIn ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself\". Rand referred to egoism as \"the virtue of selfishness\" in her book of that title. In it, she presented her solution to the is–ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of \"man\\'s survival qua man\". She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in \"Atlas Shrugged\" that, \"Force and mind are opposites\".\\nRand\\'s political philosophy emphasized individual rights, including property rights. She considered \"laissez-faire\" capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights. Rand opposed collectivism and statism, which she understood to include many specific forms of government, such as communism, fascism, socialism, theocracy, and the welfare state. Her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, Rand preferred the term \"radical for capitalism\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. Rand denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice.\\nIn aesthetics, Rand defined art as a \"selective re-creation of reality according to an artist\\'s metaphysical value-judgments\". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature. She considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.\\nCriticisms.\\nRand\\'s ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy. Numerous authors, including Robert Nozick and William F. O\\'Neill, in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas, said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem. Critics have called her definitions of \"egoism\" and \"altruism\" biased and inconsistent with normal usage. Critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism.\\nMultiple critics, including Nozick, have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails. Others, like libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer, have gone further, saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions. Some critics, like Roy Childs, have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism, rather than limited government.\\nCommentators, including Hazel Barnes, Albert Ellis, and Nathaniel Branden, have criticized Rand\\'s focus on the importance of reason. Branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be.\\nRelationship to other philosophers.\\nExcept for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals, Rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her. Acknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence, Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A\\'s\"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded: \"Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me.\"\\nIn an article for the \"Claremont Review of Books\", political scientist Charles Murray criticized her claim that her only \"philosophical debt\" was to Aristotle. He asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche. Rand found early inspiration from Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of this in Rand\\'s private journals. In 1928, she alluded to his idea of the \"superman\" in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman. There are other indications of Nietzsche\\'s influence in passages from the first edition of \"We the Living\" (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. By the time she wrote \"The Fountainhead\", Rand had turned against Nietzsche\\'s ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.\\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as \"the most evil man in mankind\\'s history\"; she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self-interest. Philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences. She was also critical of Plato, and viewed his differences with Aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy.\\nRand\\'s relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic. She was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse. She was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in-depth analysis. She was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers, who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration.\\nReception and legacy.\\nCritical reception.\\nThe first reviews Rand received were for \"Night of January 16th\". Reviews of the Broadway production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Although Rand believed that her novel \"We the Living\" was not widely reviewed, over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews. Overall, they were more positive than those she received for her later work. Her novella \"Anthem\" received little review attention, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.\\nRand\\'s first bestseller, \"The Fountainhead\", received far fewer reviews than \"We the Living\", and reviewers\\' opinions were mixed. Lorine Pruette\\'s positive review in \"The New York Times\", which called the author \"a writer of great power\" who wrote \"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\", was one that Rand greatly appreciated. There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications. Some negative reviews said the novel was too long; others called the characters unsympathetic and Rand\\'s style \"offensively pedestrian\".\\n\"Atlas Shrugged\" was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative. \"Atlas Shrugged\" received positive reviews from a few publications, but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that \"reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs\", with reviews including comments that it was \"written out of hate\" and showed \"remorseless hectoring and prolixity\". Whittaker Chambers wrote what was later called the novel\\'s most \"notorious\" review for the conservative magazine \"National Review\". He accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming, \"From almost any page of \"Atlas Shrugged\", a voice can be heard ... commanding: \\'To a gas chamber—go!.\\nRand\\'s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, \"For the New Intellectual\", was similar to that for \"Atlas Shrugged\". Philosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to \"the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union\", and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint \"nearly perfect in its immorality\". These reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics. Her subsequent books got progressively less review attention.\\nPopular interest.\\nWith over 37\\xa0million copies sold , Rand\\'s books continue to be read widely. A survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives. Rand\\'s \"Atlas Shrugged\" was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Although Rand\\'s influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.\\nRand\\'s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, like Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith; she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer, Terry Goodkind, and comic book artist Steve Ditko. Rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. Businessmen such as John Allison of BB&amp;T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand\\'s ideas.\\nTelevision shows, movies, and video games have referred to Rand and her works. Throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines, as well as book-length critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W. Robbins. Rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors, including Mary Gaitskill, Matt Ruff, Kay Nolte Smith, and Tobias Wolff. Nick Gillespie, former editor-in-chief of \"Reason\", remarked that, \"Rand\\'s is a tortured immortality, one in which she\\'s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist. Jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture.\" Two movies have been made about Rand\\'s life. A 1997 documentary film, \"\", was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. \"The Passion of Ayn Rand\", a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards. Rand\\'s image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano.\\nRand\\'s works, most commonly \"Anthem\" or \"The Fountainhead\", are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading. Since 2002, the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rand\\'s novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum. The Institute had distributed 4.5\\xa0million copies in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2020. In 2017, Rand was added to the required reading list for the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom.\\nPolitical influence.\\nAlthough she rejected the labels \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\", Rand has had a continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism. Rand is often considered one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) in the early development of modern American libertarianism. David Nolan, one founder of the Libertarian Party, said that \"without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist\". In his history of that movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as \"the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large\". Political scientist Andrew Koppelman called her \"the most widely read libertarian\". Historian Jennifer Burns referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\".\\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party), despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative, like being pro-choice and an atheist. She faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley Jr. and other contributors to the conservative \"National Review\" magazine, which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas. Nevertheless, a 1987 article in \"The New York Times\" referred to her as the Reagan administration\\'s \"novelist laureate\". Republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels. She has influenced some conservative politicians outside the U.S., such as Sajid Javid in the United Kingdom, Siv Jensen in Norway, and Ayelet Shaked in Israel.\\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially \"Atlas Shrugged\", which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis. Opinion articles compared real-world events with the novel\\'s plot. Signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests. There was increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left. Critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan. In 2015, Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan, \"Rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy\". Lisa Duggan said that Rand\\'s novels had \"incalculable impact\" in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas. In 2021, Cass Sunstein said Rand\\'s ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the Trump administration, which he attributed to the \"enduring influence\" of Rand\\'s fiction.\\nAcademic reaction.\\nDuring Rand\\'s lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars. Since her death, interest in her work has increased gradually. In 2009, historian Jennifer Burns identified \"three overlapping waves\" of scholarly interest in Rand, including \"an explosion of scholarship\" since 2000. As of that year, few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study. From 2002 to 2012, over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BB&amp;T Corporation that required teaching Rand\\'s ideas or works; in some cases, the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about Rand.\\nIn 2020, media critic Eric Burns said that, \"Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime\", but \"nobody in the academe pays any attention to her, neither as an author nor a philosopher\". That same year, the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held \"a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule\" her work, but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years.\\nTo her ideas.\\nIn 1967, John Hospers discussed Rand\\'s ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook, \"An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis\". That same year, Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing Objectivism in her book \"An Existentialist Ethics\". When the first full-length academic book about Rand\\'s philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand \"a treacherous undertaking\" that could lead to \"guilt by association\" for taking her seriously. A few articles about Rand\\'s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in \"The Personalist\". One of these was \"On the Randian Argument\" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who criticized her meta-ethical arguments. Other philosophers, writing in the same publication, argued that Nozick misstated Rand\\'s case. In an article responding to Nozick, Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen defended her positions, but described her style as \"literary, hyperbolic and emotional\".\\n\"The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand\", a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by Den Uyl and Rasmussen, was the first academic book about Rand\\'s ideas published after her death. In one essay, political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite \"the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage\", Rand\\'s ethics are \"a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought\". In 1987, the Ayn Rand Society was founded as an affiliate of the American Philosophical Association.\\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in \"Contemporary Women Philosophers\", Jenny A. Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand. She said that Rand\\'s philosophy \"is regularly omitted from academic philosophy. Yet, throughout literary academia, Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher.\" Writing in the 1998 edition of the \"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts. He said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle\\'s ethics, and her political theory \"is of little interest\" because it is marred by an \"ill-thought out and unsystematic\" effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism. \"The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies\", a multidisciplinary, peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of Rand and her ideas, was established in 1999.\\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute, Huemer argued very few people find Rand\\'s ideas convincing, especially her ethics. He attributed the attention she receives to her being a \"compelling writer\", especially as a novelist, noting that \"Atlas Shrugged\" outsells Rand\\'s non-fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism. In 2012, the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of \"The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies\", and the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an \"Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies\" series based on the Society\\'s proceedings. The Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" said that \"only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously\". That same year, political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a \"nonperson\" among academics, an attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as \"the traditional academic view\" of Rand. Philosopher Skye C. Cleary wrote in a 2018 article for \"Aeon\" that, \"Philosophers love to hate Ayn Rand. It\\'s trendy to scoff at any mention of her.\" However, Cleary said that because many people take Rand\\'s ideas seriously, philosophers \"need to treat the Ayn Rand phenomenon seriously\" and provide refutations rather than ignoring her. \\nTo her fiction.\\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy. Mimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rand\\'s novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s. Since her death, scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s. Several academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her works, as do popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes. In \"The Literary Encyclopedia\" entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that \"Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation.\" In 2019, Duggan described Rand\\'s fiction as popular and influential on many readers, despite being easy to criticize for \"her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots, her rigid moralizing, her middle- to lowbrow aesthetic preferences\\xa0... and philosophical strivings\".\\nObjectivist movement.\\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, the Objectivist movement continued in other forms. In the 1970s, Peikoff began delivering courses on Objectivism. In 1979, Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called \"The Intellectual Activist\", which Rand endorsed. She also endorsed \"The Objectivist Forum\", a bimonthly magazine founded by Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger, which ran from 1980 to 1987.\\nIn 1985, Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand\\'s ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society. In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.\\nSelected works.\\nFiction and drama:\\nNon-fiction:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"340\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340\" title=\"Alain Connes\">\\nAlain Connes\\n\\nAlain Connes (; born 1 April 1947) is a French mathematician, and a theoretical physicist, known for his contributions to the study of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry.

The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician.\\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\\nCareer.\\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California, from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 \"Robin Hood\". Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs\\' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in \"Heidi\" (1937) and \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" (1938).\\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone With the Wind\", and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, \"Sands of Iwo Jima\". He directed his last movie in 1961.\\nHe died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\\nDaniel Eagan of \"Film Journal International\" described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\\nFurther reading.\\nPrint E-book \\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"347\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347\" title=\"Algeria/People\">\\nAlgeria/People\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"353\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353\" title=\"Algeria/Transnational Issues\">\\nAlgeria/Transnational Issues\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"358\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358\" title=\"Algeria\">\\nAlgeria\\n\\nAlgeria, officially the People\\'s Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in North Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. It is considered part of the Maghreb region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of , making it the world\\'s tenth largest nation by area, and the largest nation in Africa, being more than 200 times as large as the smallest country in the continent, The Gambia. With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the ninth-most populous country in Africa, and the 32nd-most populous country in the world. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.\\nAlgeria produced and is linked to many civilizations, empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Rustamids, Idrisids, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirids, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and the French colonial empire, with the latter expanded into its present-boundaries. After 132 years of being part of France, tensions between France and the local Algerian populace led to the start of the Algerian War which concluded with Algeria obtaining its independence on 5 July 1962 with the establishment of the People\\'s Democratic Republic on 20 September of that year.\\nThe official languages of Algeria are Arabic and Berber. The majority of Algeria\\'s population is Arab, practicing Islam. The native Algerian Arabic is the main spoken language. French also serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts, but it has no official status.\\nAlgeria is a semi-presidential republic, with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes. Algeria is a regional power in North Africa, and a middle power in global affairs. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world\\'s sixteenth-largest oil reserves and the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria\\'s military is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, the OIC, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member.\\nName.\\nOther forms of the name are: , ; ; ; ; . It is officially the People\\'s Democratic Republic of Algeria (; , , ; , abbreviated as RADP).\\nEtymology.\\nThe country\\'s name derives from the city of Algiers which in turn derives from the Arabic (, \"The Islands\"), a truncated form of the older (, \"Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe\"), employed by medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi.\\nHistory.\\nPrehistory and ancient history.\\nAround ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa. Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9 million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4 million years. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.\\nNeanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the Levant. Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called Aterian (after the archaeological site of Bir el Ater, south of Tebessa).\\nThe earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian (located mainly in the Oran region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the Tassili n\\'Ajjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period. The mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.\\nFrom their principal center of power at Carthage, the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa, east of Cherchell, Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) and Rusicade (modern Skikda). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.\\nAs Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.\\nBy the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the Revolt of the Mercenaries, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage\\'s North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars.\\nIn 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the Moulouya River in modern-day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of Masinissa in the 2nd century BC.\\nAfter Masinissa\\'s death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa\\'s line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire.\\nFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. Saint Augustine was the bishop of Hippo Regius (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), located in the Roman province of Africa. The Germanic Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia. They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes. In fact, by the time the Byzantines arrived Leptis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous Laguatan who had been busy facilitating an Amazigh political, military and cultural revival. Furthermore, during the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Carthaginians, and Ottomans the Berber people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.\\nThe collapse of the Western Roman Empire led to the establishment of a native Kingdom based in Altava (modern day Algeria) known as the Mauro-Roman Kingdom. It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the Kingdom of Altava. During the reign of Kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern-day Fez in the west to the western Aurès and later Kairaouan and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east.\\nMiddle Ages.\\nAfter negligible resistance from the locals, Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate conquered Algeria in the early 8th century.\\nLarge numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the Rustamids, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirids, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads and the Zayyanids. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to Sicily by the Normans and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.\\nDuring the Middle Ages, North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including Judah Ibn Quraysh, the first grammarian to mention Semitic and Berber languages, the great Sufi masters Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan) and Sidi El Houari, and the Emirs Abd Al Mu\\'min and Yāghmūrasen. It was during this time that the Fatimids or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These \"Fatimids\" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of Arabs and Levantines extending from Algeria to their capital state of Cairo. The Fatimid Caliphate began to collapse when its governors the Zirids seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic Tāghribāt. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero Khālīfā Al-Zānatī asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The Zirids, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous Amazigh tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as Fatimid Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Tihamah, Hejaz and Yemen. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.\\nThe Berber people historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, Sanhadja, Houara, Zenata, Masmouda, Kutama, Awarba, and Berghwata). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.\\nSeveral Amazigh dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the Zirid, Ifranid, Maghrawa, Almoravid, Hammadid, Almohad, Merinid, Abdalwadid, Wattasid, Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties. Both of the Hammadid and Zirid empires as well as the Fatimids established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries. The Zirids ruled land in what is now Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Spain, Malta and Italy. The Hammadids captured and held important regions such as Ouargla, Constantine, Sfax, Susa, Algiers, Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region. The Fatimids which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all of North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East.\\nFollowing the Berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the Maghreb. In Algeria the Rustamid Kingdom was established. The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south, central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of Mali and included territory in Mauritania.\\nOnce extending their control over all of the Maghreb, part of Spain and briefly over Sicily, originating from modern Algeria, the Zirids only controlled modern Ifriqiya by the 11th century. The Zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid caliphs of Cairo. El Mu\\'izz the Zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence. The Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms, for example the Maghrawa, a Berber dynasty originating from Algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling over much of Morocco and western Algeria including Fez, Sijilmasa, Aghmat, Oujda, most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M\\'sila and the Zab in Algeria.\\nAs the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the Nile and the Red Sea were living Bedouin nomad tribes expelled from Arabia for their disruption and turbulency. The Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the Nile Valley since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then Fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he couldn\\'t control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Beduouin tribes. The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.\\nWhole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in Cyrenaica, where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in Ifriqiya by the Gabes region, arriving 1051. The Zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of Kairouan, his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield. The Arabs usually didn\\'t take control over the cities, instead looting them and destroying them.\\nThe invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of Constantine where they encircled the Qalaa of Banu Hammad (capital of the Hammadid Emirate), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper Algiers and Oran plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the Almohads in the second half of the 12th century. The influx of Bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural Arabization of the Maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal tribes had become completely arid desert.\\nThe Almohads originating from modern day Morocco, although founded by a man originating from Algeria known as Abd al-Mu\\'min would soon take control over the Maghreb. During the time of the Almohad Dynasty Abd al-Mu\\'min\\'s tribe, the Koumïa, were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire. Defeating the weakening Almoravid Empire and taking control over Morocco in 1147, they pushed into Algeria in 1152, taking control over Tlemcen, Oran, and Algiers, wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs, and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern Algeria.\\nFollowing their decisive defeat in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 the Almohads began collapsing, and in 1235 the governor of modern-day Western Algeria, Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan declared his independence and established the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Zayyanid dynasty. Warring with the Almohad forces attempting to restore control over Algeria for 13 years, they defeated the Almohads in 1248 after killing their Caliph in a successful ambush near Oujda.\\nThe Zayyanids retained their control over Algeria for 3 centuries. Much of the eastern territories of Algeria were under the authority of the Hafsid dynasty, although the Emirate of Bejaia encompassing the Algerian territories of the Hafsids would occasionally be independent from central Tunisian control. At their peak the Zayyanid kingdom included all of Morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as Tunis which they captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin.\\nAfter several conflicts with local Barbary pirates sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans, Spain decided to invade Algeria and defeat the native Kingdom of Tlemcen. In 1505, they invaded and captured Mers el Kébir, and in 1509 after a bloody siege, they conquered Oran. Following their decisive victories over the Algerians in the western-coastal areas of Algeria, the Spanish decided to get bolder, and invaded more Algerian cities. In 1510, they led a series of sieges and attacks, taking over Bejaia in a large siege, and leading a semi-successful siege against Algiers. They also besieged Tlemcen. In 1511, they took control over Cherchell and Jijel, and attacked Mostaganem where although they weren\\'t able to conquer the city, they were able to force a tribute on them.\\nOttoman era.\\nIn 1516, the Ottoman privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa, who operated successfully under the Hafsids, moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the Spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of Tlemcen, Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries. With the aid of this force and native Algerians, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).\\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin\\'s son Hasan, who assumed the position in 1544. He was a Kouloughli or of mixed origins, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse. Until 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by Beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in Algeria as the Ojaq who were led by an agha. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.\\nPlague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and had high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.\\nThe Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and other parts of the Ottoman Empire. In 1544, for example, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari, almost the entire population. In 1551, the Ottoman governor of Algiers, Turgut Reis, enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo. Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera. The introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic.\\nIn July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of Dutch pirate Jan Janszoon sailed as far as Iceland, raiding and capturing slaves. Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from Salé in Morocco had also raided in Iceland. Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland, but some chose to stay in Algeria. In 1629, pirate ships from Algeria raided the Faroe Islands.\\nIn 1671, the taifa of raises, or the company of corsair captains rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of Dey. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the divan, a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the \"ojaq\"; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey\\'s instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the pasha in that role. Although Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, in reality they acted independently from the rest of the Empire, and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the Beylik of Tunis.\\nThe dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system was in place, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency\\'s authority was seldom applied in the Kabylia, although in 1730 the Regency was able to take control over the Kingdom of Kuku in western Kabylia. Many cities in the northern parts of the Algerian desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys, although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control, while the deeper parts of the Sahara were completely independent from Algiers.\\nBarbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, and as a result, the Spanish Navy bombarded Algiers in 1783 and 1784. For the attack in 1784, the Spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of Algiers as Naples, Portugal and the Knights of Malta. Over 20,000 cannonballs were fired, much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the Algerian fleet was sunk.\\nIn 1792, Algiers took back Oran and Mers el Kébir, the two last Spanish strongholds in Algeria. In the same year, they conquered the Moroccan Rif and Oujda, which they then abandoned in 1795.\\nIn the 19th century, Algerian pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a \"license tax\" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels.\\nAttacks by Algerian pirates on American merchantmen resulted in the First and Second Barbary Wars, which ended the attacks on U.S. ships in 1815. A year later, a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet, under the command of Lord Exmouth bombarded Algiers to stop similar attacks on European fishermen. These efforts proved successful, although Algerian piracy would continue until the French conquest in 1830.\\nFrench colonization (1830–1962).\\nUnder the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830. Historian Ben Kiernan wrote on the French conquest of Algeria: \"By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830.\" French losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action. The population of Algeria, which stood at about 2.9 million in 1872, reached nearly 11 million in 1960. French policy was predicated on \"civilising\" the country. The slave trade and piracy in Algeria ceased following the French conquest. The conquest of Algeria by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872. On 17 September 1860, Napoleon III declared \"Our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million Arabs, whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination.\" During this time, only Kabylia resisted, the Kabylians were not colonized until after the Mokrani Revolt in 1871.\\nFrom 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and \"département\" of the nation. One of France\\'s longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, who became known as \"colons\" and later, as \"Pied-Noirs.\" Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria. These settlers benefited from the French government\\'s confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Many Europeans settled in Oran and Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.\\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century, the European share was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonized countries\\' path in central Asia and Caucasus, Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.\\nDuring the Second World War, Algeria came under Vichy control before being liberated by the Allies in Operation Torch, which saw the first large-scale deployment of American troops in the North African campaign.\\nGradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the Sétif and Guelma massacre. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began after the publication of the Declaration of 1 November 1954. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the National Liberation Front (FLN) or by lynch mobs in Algeria. The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals. In addition, the French destroyed over 8,000 villages and relocated over 2 million Algerians to concentration camps.\\nThe war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like Alistair Horne and Raymond Aron, state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1\\xa0million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence. Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000. The war uprooted more than 2\\xa0million Algerians.\\nThe war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum.\\nThe first three decades of independence (1962–1991).\\nThe number of European \"Pied-Noirs\" who fled Algeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964. The exodus to mainland France accelerated after the Oran massacre of 1962, in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city, and began attacking civilians.\\nAlgeria\\'s first president was the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) leader Ahmed Ben Bella. Morocco\\'s claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumédiène, his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. Oil extraction facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis.\\nBoumédienne\\'s successor, Chadli Bendjedid, introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.\\nThe Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.\\nCivil War (1991–2002) and aftermath.\\nIn December 1991 the Islamic Salvation Front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil insurgency between the Front\\'s armed wing, the Armed Islamic Group, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres. At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight 8969, a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.\\nAlgeria held elections in 1999, considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a \"Civil Concord\" initiative, approved in a referendum, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.\\nBouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which was approved in a referendum in September 2005. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.\\nIn November 2008, the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 presidential elections, and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.\\nA continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria\\'s 19-year-old state of emergency. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.\\nOn 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after mass protests against his candidacy for a fifth term in office.\\nIn December 2019, Abdelmadjid Tebboune became Algeria\\'s president, after winning the first round of the presidential election with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria\\'s democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused to be close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. He also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government in August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison.\\nGeography.\\nSince the 2011 breakup of Sudan, and the creation of South Sudan, Algeria has been the largest country in Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara. To the north, the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is Mount Tahat ().\\nAlgeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°N (a small area is north of 37°N and south of 19°N), and longitudes 9°W and 12°E. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural harbours. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.\\nThe Hoggar Mountains (), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about south of the capital, Algiers, and just east of Tamanghasset. Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and Annaba are Algeria\\'s main cities.\\nClimate and hydrology.\\nIn this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.\\nRainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as in some years.\\nFarther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has ergs, or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can go up to .\\nFauna and flora.\\nThe varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal, mountainous and grassy desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilisation. The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars, jackals, and gazelles, although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs (foxes), and jerboas. Algeria also has a small African leopard and Saharan cheetah population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the Barbary stag, inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas. The fennec fox is the national animal of Algeria.\\nA variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey. Snakes, monitor lizards, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the Barbary lions, Atlas bears and crocodiles.\\nIn the north, some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub, olive trees, oaks, cedars and other conifers. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens (Aleppo pine, juniper, and evergreen oak) and some deciduous trees. Fig, eucalyptus, agave, and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas. The grape vine is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the Sahara. Algeria had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.22/10, ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries.\\nCamels are used extensively; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes, scorpions, and numerous insects.\\nGovernment and politics.\\nElected politicians have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military \"décideurs\" (\"deciders\"), known as \"le pouvoir\" (\"the power\"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man might have been Mohamed Mediène, the head of military intelligence, before he was brought down during the 2019 protests. In recent years, many of these generals have died, retired, or been imprisoned. After the death of General Larbi Belkheir, previous president Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that made him re-electable indefinitely, until he was brought down in 2019 during protests.\\nThe head of state is the President of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president is limited to two five-year terms. The most recent presidential election was planned to be in April 2019, but widespread protests erupted on 22 February against the president\\'s decision to participate in the election, which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April. Abdelmadjid Tebboune, an independent candidate, was elected as president after the election eventually took place on 12 December 2019. Protestors refused to recognise Tebboune as president, citing demands for comprehensive reform of the political system. Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age. The President is the head of the army, the Council of Ministers and the High Security Council. He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government.\\nThe Algerian parliament is bicameral; the lower house, the People\\'s National Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the Council of the Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president. According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is \"based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession, or region\". In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.\\nParliamentary elections were last held in May 2017. In the elections, the FLN lost 44 of its seats, but remained the largest party with 164 seats, the military-backed National Rally for Democracy won 100, and the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Movement of the Society for Peace won 33.\\nForeign relations.\\nAlgeria is included in the European Union\\'s European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\\nGiving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.\\nIn 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defence Minister Herve Morin stated that \"It\\'s time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations,\" when presenting the draft law on the payouts. Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.\\nTensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight. On 24 August 2021, Algeria announced the break of diplomatic relations with Morocco.\\nMilitary.\\nThe military of Algeria consists of the People\\'s National Army (ANP), the Algerian National Navy (MRA), and the Algerian Air Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defence Forces. It is the direct successor of the National Liberation Army (Armée de Libération Nationale or ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62).\\nTotal military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate). Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 12 months. The military expenditure was 4.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. Algeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the largest defence budget in Africa ($10 billion). Most of Algeria\\'s weapons are imported from Russia, with whom they are a close ally.\\nIn 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9\\xa0billion. Russia is also building two 636-type diesel submarines for Algeria.\\nHuman rights.\\nAlgeria has been categorised by the US government funded Freedom House as \"not free\" since it began publishing such ratings in 1972, with the exception of 1989, 1990, and 1991, when the country was labelled \"partly free.\" In December 2016, the \"Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor\" issued a report regarding violation of media freedom in Algeria. It clarified that the Algerian government imposed restrictions on freedom of the press; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the media and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticise the ruling government, some media organisations\\' licenses are cancelled.\\nIndependent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the government, with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed. In 2016, a number of unions, many of which were involved in the 2010–2012 Algerian Protests, have been deregistered by the government.\\nHomosexuality is illegal in Algeria. Public homosexual behavior is punishable by up to two years in prison. Despite this, about 26% of Algerians think that homosexuality should be accepted, according to the survey conducted by the BBC News Arabic-Arab Barometer in 2019. Algeria showed largest LGBT acceptance compared to other Arab countries where the survey was conducted.\\nHuman Rights Watch has accused the Algerian authorities of using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to prevent pro-democracy movements and protests in the country, leading to the arrest of youths as part of social distancing.\\nAdministrative divisions.\\nAlgeria is divided into 58 provinces (\"wilayas\"), 553 districts (\"daïras\") and 1,541 municipalities (\"baladiyahs\"). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its seat, which is usually the largest city.\\nThe administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are\\nEconomy.\\nAlgeria\\'s currency is the dinar (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country\\'s socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. These restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about Algeria\\'s slowly-diversifying economy remain.\\nAlgeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government\\'s efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.\\nA wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.\\nThanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund. In addition, Algeria\\'s external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria\\'s budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.\\nAlgeria has not joined the WTO, despite several years of negotiations but is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area and the African Continental Free Trade Area, and has an association agreement with the European Union\\nTurkish direct investments have accelerated in Algeria, with total value reaching $5 billion. As of 2022, the number of Turkish companies present in Algeria has reached 1,400. In 2020, despite the pandemic, more than 130 Turkish companies were created in Algeria.\\nOil and natural resources.\\nAlgeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and 87.7% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had of proven natural-gas reserves. It also ranks 16th in oil reserves.\\nNon-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.\\nIncome from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards. Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962, and 70% of budgetary receipts, or US$71.4 billion.\\nThe Algerian national oil company is Sonatrach, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.\\nAccess to biocapacity in Algeria is lower than world average. In 2016, Algeria had 0.53 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016, Algeria used 2.4 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use just under 4.5 times as much biocapacity as Algeria contains. As a result, Algeria is running a biocapacity deficit. In April 2022, diplomats from Italy and Spain held talks after Rome\\'s move to secure large volume of Algerian gas stoked concerns in Madrid. Under the deal between Algeria\\'s Sonatrach and Italy\\'s Eni, Algeria will send an additional 9 billion cubic metres of gas to Italy by next year and in 2024.\\nResearch and alternative energy sources.\\nAlgeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers. This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power. Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R\\'Mel. Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000. Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.\\nLabour market.\\nThe overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programs introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the program to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d\\'Aide à l\\'Insertion Professionnelle).\\nDespite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high.\\nTourism.\\nThe development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.\\nThere are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qal\\'a of Beni Hammad, the first capital of the Hammadid empire; Tipasa, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and Djémila and Timgad, both Roman ruins; M\\'Zab Valley, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis; and the Casbah of Algiers, an important citadel. The only natural World Heritage Site is the Tassili n\\'Ajjer, a mountain range.\\nTransport.\\nThe Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the East-West Highway, a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a 3-way, highway, linking Annaba in the extreme east to the Tlemcen in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the Trans-Sahara Highway, which is now completely paved. This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, and Tunisia.\\nDemographics.\\nAlgeria has a population of an estimated 44\\xa0million, of which the majority, 75% to 85% are ethnically Arab. At the outset of the 20th century, its population was approximately four million. About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the inhabitants of the Sahara desert are mainly concentrated in oases, although some 1.5\\xa0million remain nomadic or partly nomadic. 28.1% of Algerians are under the age of 15.\\nBetween 90,000 and 165,000 Sahrawis from Western Sahara live in the Sahrawi refugee camps, in the western Algerian Sahara desert. There are also more than 4,000 Palestinian refugees, who are well integrated and have not asked for assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 2009, 35,000 Chinese migrant workers lived in Algeria.\\nThe largest concentration of Algerian migrants outside Algeria is in France, which has reportedly over 1.7 million Algerians of up to the second generation.\\nEthnic groups.\\nArabs and indigenous Berbers as well as Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantine Greeks, Turks, various Sub-Saharan Africans, and French have contributed to the history and culture of Algeria. Descendants of Andalusian refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities. Moreover, Spanish was spoken by these Aragonese and Castillian Morisco descendants deep into the 18th century, and even Catalan was spoken at the same time by Catalan Morisco descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued.\\nThe majority of the population of Algeria are Arabs (75% to 85% of the population). Berbers who make up 15% to 20% of the population are divided into many groups with varying languages. The largest of these are the Kabyles, who live in the Kabylie region east of Algiers, the Chaoui of Northeast Algeria, the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the Shenwa people of North Algeria.\\nDuring the colonial period, there was a large (10% in 1960) European population who became known as \"Pied-Noirs\". They were primarily of French, Spanish and Italian origin. Almost all of this population left during the war of independence or immediately after its end.\\nLanguages.\\nModern Standard Arabic and Berber are the official languages. Algerian Arabic (Darja) is the language used by the majority of the population. Colloquial Algerian Arabic has some Berber loanwords which represent 8% to 9% of its vocabulary.\\nBerber has been recognised as a \"national language\" by the constitutional amendment of 8 May 2002. Kabyle, the predominant Berber language, is taught and is partially co-official (with a few restrictions) in parts of Kabylie. Kabyle has a significant Arabic, French, Latin, Greek, Phoenician and Punic substratum, and Arabic loanwords represent 35% of the total Kabyle vocabulary. In February 2016, the Algerian constitution passed a resolution that made Berber an official language alongside Arabic.\\nAlthough French has no official status in Algeria, it has one of the largest Francophone populations in the world, and French is widely used in government, media (newspapers, radio, local television), and both the education system (from primary school onwards) and academia due to Algeria\\'s colonial history. It can be regarded as a lingua franca of Algeria. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French. An Abassa Institute study in April 2000 found that 60% of households could speak and understand French, or 18 million people out of a total of 30 million at the time. Following a period during which the Algerian government tried to phase out French, in recent decades the government has changed course and reinforced the study of French, and some television programs are broadcast in the language.\\nAlgeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962. Colloquial Algerian Arabic is spoken by about 83% of the population and Berber by 27%.\\nReligion.\\nIslam is the predominant religion in Algeria, with its adherents, mostly Sunnis, accounting for 99% of the population according to a 2021 CIA \"World Factbook\" estimate, and 97.9% according to Pew Research in 2020. There are about 290,000 Ibadis in the M\\'zab Valley in the region of Ghardaia. \\nPrior to independence, Algeria was home to more than 1.3 million Christians (mostly of French ancestry). Many Christian settlers left to France after the independence from France. Today, estimates of the Christian population range from 20,000 to 200,000. Algerian citizens who are Christians predominantly belong to Protestant groups, which have seen increased pressure from the government in recent years including many forced closures.\\nAccording to the Arab Barometer in 2018-2019, the vast majority of Algerians (99.1%) continue to identify as Muslim. The June 2019 Arab Barometer-BBC News report found that the percentage of Algerians identifying as non-religious has grown from around 8% in 2013 to around 15% in 2018. The Arab Barometer December 2019, found that the growth in the percentage of Algerians identifying as non-religious is largely driven by young Algerians, with roughly 25% describing themselves as non-religious. However, the 2021 Arab Barometer report found that those who said they were not religious among Algerians has decreased, with just 2.6% identifying as non-religious. In that same report, 69.5% of Algerians identified as religious and another 27.8% identifying as somewhat religious.\\nAlgeria has given the Muslim world a number of prominent thinkers, including Emir Abdelkader, Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mouloud Kacem Naît Belkacem, Malek Bennabi and Mohamed Arkoun.\\nHealth.\\nIn 2018, Algeria had the highest numbers of physicians in the Maghreb region (1.72 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to \"improved water sources\" was around 97.4% of the population in urban areas and 98.7% of the population in the rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, and around 93.4% of those living in rural areas, had access to \"improved sanitation\". According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of \"reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015\". Given Algeria\\'s young population, policy favours preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunisation program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause tuberculosis, hepatitis, measles, typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.\\nHealth records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the south to their vital record database in 1905 during French rule.\\nEducation.\\nSince the 1970s, in a centralised system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 92.6%. Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five. Apart from the 122 private schools, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the baccalaureate, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.\\nEducation is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was Algiers Province at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was Djelfa Province at 35.5%.\\nAlgeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The University of Algiers, founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). Twenty-five of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.\\nEven if some of them offer instruction in Arabic like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, the University of Mentouri Constantine, and University of Oran Es-Senia. The University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd in Tlemcen and University of Batna Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa. Algeria was ranked 120th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, down from 113rd in 2019.\\nCulture.\\nModern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, Tamazight and French, has been strongly influenced by the country\\'s recent history. Famous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib, Albert Camus, Kateb Yacine and Ahlam Mosteghanemi while Assia Djebar is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were Rachid Mimouni, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and Tahar Djaout, murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views.\\nMalek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization; Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste (modern-day Souk Ahras); and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria. The works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author Apuleius was born in Madaurus (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.\\nContemporary Algerian cinema is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.\\nArt.\\nAlgerian painters, like or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonisation, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, Mohamed Temam, Abdelkhader Houamel have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of M\\'hamed Issiakhem, Mohammed Khadda and Bachir Yelles, appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. Mohammed Khadda and M\\'hamed Issiakhem have been notable in recent years.\\nLiterature.\\nThe historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the Numidian and Roman African era, when Apuleius wrote \"The Golden Ass\", the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known Augustine of Hippo, Nonius Marcellus and Martianus Capella, among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionised the Arab world literature, with authors like Ahmad al-Buni, Ibn Manzur and Ibn Khaldoun, who wrote the Muqaddimah while staying in Algeria, and many others.\\nAlbert Camus was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.\\nToday Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.\\nAs a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the \"Algerian trilogy\" of Mohammed Dib, or even \"Nedjma\" of Kateb Yacine novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include Mouloud Feraoun, Malek Bennabi, Malek Haddad, Moufdi Zakaria, Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, Mouloud Mammeri, Frantz Fanon, and Assia Djebar.\\nIn the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are Rachid Boudjedra, Rachid Mimouni, Leila Sebbar, Tahar Djaout and Tahir Wattar.\\nCurrently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, \"the swallows of Kabul\" and \"the attack\" of Yasmina Khadra, \"the oath of barbarians\" of Boualem Sansal, \"memory of the flesh\" of Ahlam Mosteghanemi and the last novel by Assia Djebar \"nowhere in my father\\'s House\".\\nMusic.\\nChaâbi music is a typically Algerian musical genre characterized by specific rhythms and of Qacidate (popular poems) in Arabic dialect. El Hadj M\\'Hamed El Anka is considered the greatest master of the art in modern times. He wrote over 350 songs and produced some 130 records before his death in 1978. Many of his pupils went on to be renowned musicians. The Constantinois Malouf style is saved by musician from whom Mohamed Tahar Fergani is a performer.\\nFolk music styles include Bedouin music, characterized by the poetic songs based on long kacida (poems); Kabyle music, based on a rich repertoire that is poetry and old tales passed through generations; Shawiya music, a folklore from diverse areas of the Aurès Mountains. Rahaba music style is unique to the Aures. Souad Massi is a rising Algerian folk singer. Other Algerian singers of the diaspora include Manel Filali in Germany and Kenza Farah in France. Tergui music is sung in Tuareg languages generally, Tinariwen had a worldwide success. Finally, the staïfi music is born in Sétif and remains a unique style of its kind.\\nModern music is available in several facets, Raï music is a style typical of western Algeria. Rap, a relatively recent style in Algeria, is experiencing significant growth.\\nCinema.\\nThe Algerian state\\'s interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.3 million) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.\\nThe financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.\\nAccording to the European Audiovisual Observatory\\'s LUMIERE database, 41 Algerian films were distributed in Europe between 1996 and 2013; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions. \"Days of Glory\" (2006) and \"Outside the Law\" (2010) recorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union, 3,172,612 and 474,722, respectively.\\nAlgeria won the Palme d\\'Or for \"Chronicle of the Years of Fire\" (1975), two Oscars for \"Z\" (1969), and other awards for the Italian-Algerian movie \"The Battle of Algiers\".\\nCuisine.\\nAlgerian cuisine is rich and diverse. The country was considered as the \"granary of Rome\". It offers a component of dishes and varied dishes, depending on the region and according to the seasons. The cuisine uses cereals as the main products, since they are always produced with abundance in the country. There is not a dish where cereals are not present.\\nAlgerian cuisine varies from one region to another, according to seasonal vegetables. It can be prepared using meat, fish and vegetables. Among the dishes known, couscous, chorba, rechta, chakhchoukha, berkoukes, shakshouka, mthewem, chtitha, mderbel, dolma, brik or bourek, garantita, lham\\'hlou, etc. Merguez sausage is widely used in Algeria, but it differs, depending on the region and on the added spices.\\nCakes are marketed and can be found in cities either in Algeria, in Europe or North America. However, traditional cakes are also made at home, following the habits and customs of each family. Among these cakes, there are Tamina, Baklawa, Chrik, Garn logzelles, Griouech, Kalb el-louz, Makroud, Mbardja, Mchewek, Samsa, Tcharak, Baghrir, Khfaf, Zlabia, Aarayech, Ghroubiya and Mghergchette. Algerian pastry also contains Tunisian or French cakes. Marketed and home-made bread products include varieties such as Kessra or Khmira or Harchaya, chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue. Other traditional meals sold often as street food include mhadjeb or mahjouba, karantika, doubara, chakhchoukha, hassouna, and t\\'chicha.\\nSports.\\nVarious games have existed in Algeria since antiquity. In the Aures, people played several games such as El Kherba or El khergueba (chess variant). Playing cards, checkers and chess games are part of Algerian culture. Racing (fantasia) and rifle shooting are part of cultural recreation of the Algerians.\\nThe first Algerian and African gold medalist is Boughera El Ouafi in 1928 Olympics of Amsterdam in the Marathon. The second Algerian Medalist was Alain Mimoun in 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Several men and women were champions in athletics in the 1990s including Noureddine Morceli, Hassiba Boulmerka, Nouria Merah-Benida, and Taoufik Makhloufi, all specialized in middle-distance running.\\nFootball is the most popular sport in Algeria. Several names are engraved in the history of the sport, including Lakhdar Belloumi, Rachid Mekhloufi, Hassen Lalmas, Rabah Madjer, Riyad Mahrez, Salah Assad and Djamel Zidane. The Algeria national football team qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, 1986 FIFA World Cup, 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup. In addition, several football clubs have won continental and international trophies as the club ES Sétif or JS Kabylia. The Algerian Football Federation is an association of Algeria football clubs organizing national competitions and international matches of the selection of Algeria national football team.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"359\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359\" title=\"List of Atlas Shrugged characters\">\\nList of Atlas Shrugged characters\\n\\nThis is a list of characters in Ayn Rand\\'s 1957 novel \"Atlas Shrugged.\"\\nMajor characters.\\nThe following are major characters from the novel.\\nProtagonists.\\nDagny Taggart.\\nDagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel. She is vice-president in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. Given James\\' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.\\nFrancisco d\\'Anconia.\\nFrancisco d\\'Anconia is one of the central characters in \"Atlas Shrugged\", an owner by inheritance of the world\\'s largest copper mining operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the \"climax\" of the d\\'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working while still in school, “proving” that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family\\'s wealth and power. Later, Francisco bankrupts the d\\'Anconia business to put it out of others\\' reach. His full name is given as \"Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d\\'Anconia\".\\nJohn Galt.\\nJohn Galt is the primary male hero of \"Atlas Shrugged\". He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees\\' cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie\\'s side of their conversations is given in the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker\\'s true identity.\\nBefore working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel, working a job and living by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. Much of the book\\'s third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the author\\'s philosophy of Objectivism.\\nHenry \"Hank\" Rearden.\\nHenry (known as \"Hank\") Rearden is one of the central characters in \"Atlas Shrugged\". He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an alloy stronger, lighter, cheaper and tougher than steel. He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of self-made man and eventually divorces Lillian, abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers, and joins John Galt\\'s strike.\\nEddie Willers.\\nEdwin \"Eddie\" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt\\'s associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.\\nRagnar Danneskjöld.\\nOne of Galt\\'s first followers, and world-famous as a pirate, who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People\\'s States of Europe. He works to ensure that once those espousing Galt\\'s philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired film star. Considered a misfit by Galt\\'s other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt\\'s perspective.\\nAccording to Barbara Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld\\'s adventures at sea, cut from the final published text. In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld\\'s name was a tribute to Victor Hugo\\'s novel, , wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld. In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.\\nAntagonists.\\nJames Taggart.\\nThe President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book\\'s most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.\\nLillian Rearden.\\nThe unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value. Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband\\'s affair with his sister. This information is used to blackmail Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.\\nDr. Floyd Ferris.\\nFerris is a biologist who works as \"co-ordinator\" at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled \"Why Do You Think You Think?\" He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.\\nDr. Robert Stadler.\\nA former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d\\'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including a sound-based weapon known as Project X (Xylophone). He is killed when Cuffy Meigs (see below) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X, causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius. The character was, in part, modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons.` To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the \"man who knew better\" but chose not to act for the good.\\nWesley Mouch.\\nThe incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington, who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country. Mouch\\'s mantra, whenever a problem arises from his prior policy, is to say, \"I can\\'t help it. I need wider powers.\"\\nSecondary characters.\\nThe following secondary characters also appear in the novel.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"369\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369\" title=\"Topics of note in Atlas Shrugged\">\\nTopics of note in Atlas Shrugged\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"569\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569\" title=\"Anthropology\">\\nAnthropology\\n\\nAnthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics, in both the present and past, including past human species. Social anthropology studies patterns of behavior, while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning, including norms and values. A portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today. Linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.\\nArchaeological anthropology, often termed as “anthropology of the past,” studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence. It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia, while in Europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history and palaeontology.\\nEtymology.\\nThe abstract noun \"anthropology\" is first attested in reference to history. Its present use first appeared in Renaissance Germany in the works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann. Their New Latin \\' derived from the combining forms of the Greek words \"ánthrōpos\" (, \"human\") and \"lógos\" (, \"study\"). Its adjectival form appeared in the works of Aristotle. It began to be used in English, possibly via French \\', by the early 18th century.\\nHistory.\\nThrough the 19th century.\\nIn 1647, the Bartholins, early scholars of the University of Copenhagen, defined \"\" as follows:\\nSporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the French National Museum of Natural History by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The Société Ethnologique de Paris, the first to use the term \"ethnology\", was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848, the \"Société\" was abandoned.\\nMeanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the American Ethnological Society, was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the Ethnological Society of London in 1843, a break-away group of the Aborigines\\' Protection Society. These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-human-rights activists. They maintained international connections.\\nAnthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy, linguistics, and ethnology, making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then. For them, the publication of Charles Darwin\\'s \"On the Origin of Species\" was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild.\\nDarwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. Paul Broca in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the Société d\\'Anthropologie de Paris, meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859. When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to \"Transformisme\", as the French called evolutionism. His definition now became \"the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature\".\\nBroca, being what today would be called a neurosurgeon, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called Broca\\'s area after him. His interest was mainly in Biological anthropology, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, Theodor Waitz, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled \"Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker\", 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as \"The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples\". The last two volumes were published posthumously.\\nWaitz defined anthropology as \"the science of the nature of man\". Following Broca\\'s lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from \"the animals nearest to him\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\".\\nWaitz was influential among British ethnologists. In 1863, the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological Society of London, which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French \"Société\" were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, \"The Anthropological Review\", Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard. Among the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor, inventor of cultural anthropology, and his brother Alfred Tylor, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.\\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionists. One notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin\\'s conclusions lacked empirical foundation.\\nDuring the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898, 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.\\n20th and 21st centuries.\\nThis meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world\\'s higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached a global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), \"a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology\", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.\\nSince the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, \"social\" anthropology in Great Britain and \"cultural\" anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance they place on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas\\' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead\\'s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.\\nIn Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century: \"biological\" or \"physical\" anthropology; \"social\", \"cultural\", or \"sociocultural\" anthropology; and archaeological anthropology; plus linguistic anthropology. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.\\nEuropean countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F. Kollár in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.\\nFields.\\nAnthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of \"Homo sapiens\", human physical traits, human behavior, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of \"Homo sapiens\" has influenced its social organization and culture, and from social sciences, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc. Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity, such as by Al-Biruni of the Islamic Golden Age. As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, global studies, and various ethnic studies.\\nAccording to Clifford Geertz,\\nSociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline. During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.\\nSociocultural.\\nSociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people \"make sense\" of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the \"relationships\" among individuals and groups. Cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy, literature and the arts (how one\\'s culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people\\'s knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history. In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.\\nInquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic (conceptual, vs. etic, or technical) point of view.\\nThe study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal. Sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).\\nComparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) includes 186 such cultures.\\nBiological.\\nBiological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.\\nArchaeological.\\nArchaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.\\nLinguistic.\\nLinguistic anthropology (not to be confused with anthropological linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics, semiotics, discourse analysis, and narrative analysis.\\nEthnography.\\nEthnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction. It often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions. Ethnography views first-hand experience and social context as important.\\nTim Ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience, applicable in general and novel settings, while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity. He argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory, but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another.\\nKey topics by field: sociocultural.\\nArt, media, music, dance and film.\\nArt.\\nOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of \\'art\\' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of \\'painting\\', \\'sculpture\\', or \\'literature\\', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being \\'artistic\\', have certain evident \\'aesthetic\\' qualities. Boas\\' \"Primitive Art\", Claude Lévi-Strauss\\' \"The Way of the Masks\" (1982) or Geertz\\'s \\'Art as Cultural System\\' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of \\'art\\' into an anthropology of culturally specific \\'aesthetics\\'.\\nMedia.\\nMedia anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include cyber anthropology, a relatively new area of internet research, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, social movements, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, the press, new media, and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.\\nMusic.\\nEthnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.\\nEthnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc.\\xa0 While the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, it was formally introduced as \"ethnomusicology\" by Dutch scholar Jaap Kunst around 1950. Later, the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical \"Ethnomusicology\" and the Society of Ethnomusicology.\\nVisual.\\nVisual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film, visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and reception of mass media. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphs, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.\\nEconomic, political economic, applied and development.\\nEconomic.\\nEconomic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, Bronisław Malinowski, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast. Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.\\nPolitical economy.\\nPolitical economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the \"pre-capitalist\" societies that were subject to evolutionary \"tribal\" stereotypes. Sahlin\\'s work on hunter-gatherers as the \"original affluent society\" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world\\'s population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system. More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.\\nApplied.\\nApplied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". Applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to development anthropology (distinct from the more critical anthropology of development).\\nDevelopment.\\nAnthropology of development tends to view development from a \"critical\" perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?\\nKinship, feminism, gender and sexuality.\\nKinship.\\n\"Kinship\" can refer both to \"the study of\" the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to \"the patterns of social relationships\" themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as \"descent\", \"descent groups\", \"lineages\", \"affines\", \"cognates\", and even \"fictive kinship\". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one\\'s social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage. Within kinship you have two different families. People have their biological families and it is the people they share DNA with. This is called consanguineal relations or \"blood ties\". People can also have a chosen family in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family. In some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families.\\nFeminist.\\nFeminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology (archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of Europe, America, and elsewhere. From the perspective of the Western world, historically such \\'peripheral\\' perspectives have been ignored, observed only from an outsider perspective, and regarded as less-valid or less-important than knowledge from the Western world. Exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology.\\nFeminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology, along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the \"patriarchal origins of anthropology (and (academia)\" and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85%, more than 81% were under 35, and only 7.2% to anyone over 40 years old, thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first-wave feminists until later in life. This correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory, history, linguistics, archaeology, and anthropology. Feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexism.\\nAccording to St. Clair Drake, Vera Mae Green was, until \"[w]ell into the 1960s\", the only African-American female anthropologist who was also a Caribbeanist. She studied ethnic and family relations in the Caribbean as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied. However, Zora Neale Hurston, although often primarily considered to be a literary author, was trained in anthropology by Franz Boas, and published \"Tell my Horse\" about her \"anthropological observations\" of voodoo in the Caribbean (1938).\\nFeminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization, which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies.\\nMedical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal.\\nMedical.\\nMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies \"human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation\". It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:\\nOther subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as \"cultural psychiatry\" and \"transcultural psychiatry\" or \"ethnopsychiatry\".\\nNutritional.\\nNutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems, nutritional status and food security, and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.\\nPsychological.\\nPsychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans\\' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group\\xa0– with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories\\xa0– shape processes of human cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and mental health. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.\\nCognitive.\\nCognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural innovation, and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences (especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.\\nTranspersonal.\\nTranspersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture. As with transpersonal psychology, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and transpersonal experience. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues – for instance, the roles of myth, ritual, diet, and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.\\nPolitical and legal.\\nPolitical.\\nPolitical anthropology concerns the structure of political systems, looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more \"complex\" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz\\' comparative work on \"Negara\", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.\\nLegal.\\nLegal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in \"the cross-cultural study of social ordering\". Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as human rights, legal pluralism, and political uprisings.\\nPublic.\\nPublic anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to \"demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change\".\\nNature, science, and technology.\\nCyborg.\\nCyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association\\'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science. Donna Haraway\\'s 1985 \"Cyborg Manifesto\" could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.\\nDigital.\\nDigital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect. It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology, and sometimes considered part of material culture. The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology, digital ethnography, cyberanthropology, and virtual anthropology.\\nEcological.\\nEcological anthropology is defined as the \"study of cultural adaptations to environments\". The sub-field is also defined as, \"the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment\". The focus of its research concerns \"how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environments change across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.\\nEnvironment.\\nSocial sciences, like anthropology, can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment. Professor Kay Milton, Director of the Anthropology research network in the School of History and Anthropology, describes anthropology as distinctive, with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non-industrial indigenous and traditional societies. Anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture; not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition. Milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology: dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective, reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory (nature culture divide), and finally an increased attention to globalization (transcending the barriers or time/space).\\nEnvironmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization. (The troubling problem is borrowing non-indigenous practices and creating standards, concepts, philosophies and practices in western countries.) Anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline. Knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology. Human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change, a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed. Other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts,\\xa0 or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral/universal, etc. In exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected, particularly from the harmful effects of human activities. Environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways. Anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society, understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships, knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by, dependent and independent variables, \"primitive\" ecological wisdom, diverse environments, resource management, diverse cultural traditions, and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture.\\nHistorical.\\nEthnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records. It is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.\\nReligion.\\nThe anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human community that worships it.\\nUrban.\\nUrban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism. Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were \"a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition\". Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the \"Third World\" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of \"specialists in \\'other cultures\\'\" closer to their homes. There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.\\nKey topics by field: archaeological and biological.\\nAnthrozoology.\\nAnthrozoology (also known as \"human–animal studies\") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.\\nBiocultural.\\nBiocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture. Physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective; that is, from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences. After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.\\nEvolutionary.\\nEvolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates. Evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science, combining the human development with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a scientific approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics. It is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.\\nForensic.\\nForensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim\\'s remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective \"forensic\" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.\\nPalaeoanthropology.\\nPaleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints. Genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field. Markers on specimens, such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth, can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations.\\nOrganizations.\\nContemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the American Anthropological Association (AAA), which was founded in 1903. Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.\\nIn 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.\\nHundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music theory, art history, sociology and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.\\nEthics.\\nAs the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.\\nAnthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.\\nSome commentators have contended:\\nCultural relativism.\\nAs part of their quest for scientific objectivity, present-day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology. This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another\\'s values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.\\nEthical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide, infanticide, racism, sexism, mutilation (including circumcision and subincision), and torture. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies, to genes, to acculturation, to colonialism, have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences.\\nTo illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as \"racism\" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.\\nMilitary involvement.\\nAnthropologists\\' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.\\nBut by the 1940s, many of Boas\\' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the Axis Powers (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information). At the same time, David H. Price\\'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.\\nAttempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement. Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA).\\nProfessional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The \"Principles of Professional Responsibility\" issued by the American Anthropological Association and amended through November 1986 stated that \"in relation with their own government and with host governments\\xa0... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.\" The current \"Principles of Professional Responsibility\" does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions.\\nAnthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army\\'s strategy in Afghanistan. \"The Christian Science Monitor\" reports that \"Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs\" in Afghanistan, under the \"Human Terrain System\" (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq. In 2009, the American Anthropological Association\\'s Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, \"When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of \"anthropology\" within DoD.\"\\nPost-World War II developments.\\nBefore WWII British \\'social anthropology\\' and American \\'cultural anthropology\\' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as \\'sociocultural\\' anthropology.\\nBasic trends.\\nThere are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical. The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.\\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.\\nBiological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures). They use many different methods of study, but modern population genetics, participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists \"into the field,\" which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called \"fieldwork.\" On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.\\nAlong with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.\\nCommonalities between fields.\\nBecause anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting, exploring, documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and religious studies, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.\\nSome authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of \"other cultures\", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies). For example, the classic of urban anthropology, Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal \"Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology\" mentions that the \"Third World\" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in \"other cultures\" looked for them far away and started to look \"across the tracks\" only in late 1960s.\\nNow there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author\\'s \"home\". It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and Sociology, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.\\nIn France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like \"Terrain\" (\"fieldwork\"), and developing with the center founded by Marc Augé (\"Le Centre d\\'anthropologie des mondes contemporains\", the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).\\nSince the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.\\nSee also.\\nLists\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"572\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=572\" title=\"Agricultural science\">\\nAgricultural science\\n\\nAgricultural science (or agriscience for short) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture.

In its Western form, alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries AD.\\nAlchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \"base metals\" (e.g., lead) into \"noble metals\" (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical \"magnum opus\" (\"Great Work\"). The concept of creating the philosophers\\' stone was variously connected with all of these projects.\\nIslamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques, theories, and terms, some of which are still in use today. They did not abandon the Ancient Greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements, and they tended to guard their work in secrecy, often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism. In Europe, the 12th-century translations of medieval Islamic works on science and the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy. This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science (particularly chemistry and medicine).\\nModern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects, despite criticisms by scholars such as Eric J. Holmyard and Marie-Louise von Franz that they should be understood as complementary. The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences, who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry, medicine, and charlatanism, and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of esotericism, psychologists, and some philosophers and spiritualists. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.\\nEtymology.\\nThe word alchemy comes from old French \"alquemie\", \"alkimie\", used in Medieval Latin as . This name was itself adopted from the Arabic word (). The Arabic in turn was a borrowing of the Late Greek term \"khēmeía\" (), also spelled \"khumeia\" () and \"khēmía\" (), with \"al-\" being the Arabic definite article \\'the\\'. Together this association can be interpreted as \\'the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form\\'. Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term. The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis (3rd–4th centuries), who derived it from the name of a book, the \"Khemeu.\" Hermanm Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from χύμα, used to describe metallic objects formed by casting.\\nOthers trace its roots to the Egyptian name \\' (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 \\' ), meaning \\'black earth\\', which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand. According to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, the Arabic word \"ʾ\" actually means \"the Egyptian [science]\", borrowing from the Coptic word for \"Egypt\", \\' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic, \\'). This Coptic word derives from Demotic \\', itself from ancient Egyptian \\'. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour \"black\" (Egypt was the \"black Land\", by contrast with the \"red Land\", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname \"Egyptian black arts\".\\nHistory.\\nAlchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions\\' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and \"genetic\" relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be mostly independent, at least in their earlier stages: Chinese alchemy, centered in China; Indian alchemy, centered on the Indian subcontinent; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from Greco-Roman Egypt to the Islamic world, and finally medieval Europe. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism and Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths. In contrast, Western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various Western religions. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.\\nHellenistic Egypt.\\nThe start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt, where the city of Alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. Following the work of André-Jean Festugière, modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire as originating from the Egyptian goldsmith\\'s art, Greek philosophy and different religious traditions. Tracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus. The treatises of Zosimos of Panopolis, the earliest historically attested author (fl. c. 300 CE), can help in situating the other authors. Zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors, such as Mary the Jewess, Pseudo-Democritus, and Agathodaimon, but very little is known about any of these authors. The most complete of their works, The \"Four Books\" of Pseudo-Democritus, were probably written in the first century AD.\\nRecent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of Zosimus, who traced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices. It has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way. Zosimos of Panopolis wrote in the \"Final Abstinence\" (also known as the \"Final Count\"). Zosimos explains that the ancient practice of \"tinctures\" (the technical Greek name for the alchemical arts) had been taken over by certain \"demons\" who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices. Since Zosimos also called the demons \"the guardians of places\" (, ) and those who offered them sacrifices \"priests\" (, ), it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests. While critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the Egyptian priests and their followers, Zosimos nonetheless saw the tradition\\'s recent past as rooted in the rites of the Egyptian temples.\\nMythology – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion. Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation. These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, Isis, Osiris, Jason, and many others.\\nThe central figure in the mythology of alchemy is Hermes Trismegistus (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the god Thoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes. Hermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff, were among alchemy\\'s principal symbols. According to Clement of Alexandria, he wrote what were called the \"forty-two books of Hermes\", covering all fields of knowledge. The \"Hermetica\" of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.\\nTechnology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy, extending back to 3500\\xa0BC. Many writings were lost when the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (AD\\xa0292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X. Dating from AD\\xa0250–300, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver. These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements. Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.\\nPhilosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy\\'s character. An important example of alchemy\\'s roots in Greek philosophy, originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed. The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; \"...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.\" Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.\\nAlchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity. Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. St\\xa0Augustine later affirmed this in the 4th &amp; 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry. Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.\\nMost of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as Moses, Isis, Cleopatra, Democritus, and Ostanes. Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we only know through fragments of text. After AD\\xa0400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors. By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline. It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.\\nByzantium.\\nGreek alchemy is preserved in medieval Greek (Byzantine) manuscripts, and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of Greek alchemy in the Byzantine period.\\nIndia.\\nThe 2nd millennium BC text Vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold. A considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third-century CE text called Arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives (Agniyoga) and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains (Yavakshara) such as saltpetre/nitre, perfume making (different qualities of perfumes are mentioned), granulated (refined) Sugar. Buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold. According to some scholars Greek alchemy may have influenced Indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim.\\nThe 11th-century Persian chemist and physician Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī, who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni, reported that they\\nThe goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit \"divya-deham\") and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit \"jīvan-mukti\"). Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī.\\nSome early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath. Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise \"Kalyāṇakārakam\" of Ugrāditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.\\nTwo famous early Indian alchemical authors were Nāgārjuna Siddha and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, \"Rasendramangalam\", is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote \"Rasaratnākara\", also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, \"rasa\" translates to \"mercury\", and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.\\nScholarship on Indian alchemy is in the publication of \"The Alchemical Body\" by David Gordon White. \\nA modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has been written by White.\\nThe contents of 39 Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in G. Jan Meulenbeld\\'s \"History of Indian Medical Literature\". The discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each work, their special features, and where possible the evidence concerning their dating. Chapter 13 of HIML, \"Various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra\" (or \"Various works on alchemy and gems\") gives brief details of a further 655 (six hundred and fifty-five) treatises. In some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles.\\nA great deal remains to be discovered about Indian alchemical literature. The content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet (2014) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy.\\nIslamic world.\\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations. The word \"alchemy\" itself was derived from the Arabic word \"al-kīmiyā\" (الكيمياء). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. Platonic and Aristotelian thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship.\\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Arabic works attributed to Jābir ibn Hayyān (Latinized as \"Geber\" or \"Geberus\") introduced a new approach to alchemy. Paul Kraus, who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir, put it as follows:\\nIslamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir\\'s ultimate goal was \"Takwin\", the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of \"hotness\", \"coldness\", \"dryness\", and \"moistness\". According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. By this reasoning, the search for the philosopher\\'s stone was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance\\'s name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element\\'s physical properties.\\nThe elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five classical elements (aether, air, earth, fire, and water) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals: sulphur, \"the stone which burns\", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and mercury, which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and salt giving solidity. The atomic theory of corpuscularianism, where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.\\nFrom the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including Alkindus, Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun. In particular, they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals.\\nFrom the 14th century onwards, many materials and practices originally belonging to Indian alchemy (Rasayana) were assimilated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars.\\nEast Asia.\\nResearchers have found evidence that Chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with Arab alchemists during the medieval period. Discovered in BC China, the \"magic square of three\" was an propagated to followers of Abū Mūsā Jābir ibn Ḥayyān at some point over the proceeding several hundred years. Other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements. The silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods, ideas, ingredients, religion, and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined.\\nWhereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The philosopher\\'s stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists. In the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher\\'s stone was often equated with the universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.\\nAs early as 317 AD, Ge Hong documented the use of metals, minerals, and elixirs in early Chinese medicine. Hong identified three ancient Chinese documents, titled \"Scripture of Great Clarity, Scripture of the Nine Elixirs\", and \"Scripture of the Golden Liquor,\" as texts containing fundamental alchemical information. He also described alchemy, along with meditation, as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend. In his work \"Inner Chapters of the Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature\" (317 AD), Hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide. In the centuries following Ge Hong\\'s death, the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among Chinese Daoists was reduced. In 499 AD, Tao Hongjing refuted Hong\\'s statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as Shangqing meditation. While Hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection, he ultimately the found the \"Scripture of the Nine Elixirs\" to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling, aiming to implement more accessible practicing techniques.\\nIn the early 700s, Neidan (also known as internal alchemy) was adopted by Daoists as a new form of alchemy. Neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practicing alchemy with compounds found in the body, rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early Dao alchemy. For example, saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and didn\\'t require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce. The inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person, but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region. Although those who practiced Neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies, many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous Daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation. Eternal life remained a consideration for Neidan alchemists, as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfillment.\\nBlack powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts and used in fireworks in China by the 10th century, it was used in cannons by 1290. From China, the use of gunpowder spread to Japan, the Mongols, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.\\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion. In the early Song dynasty, followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest mercuric sulfide, which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide. Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the qi, etc.) Chinese alchemy was introduced to the West by Obed Simon Johnson.\\nMedieval Europe.\\nThe introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of Robert of Chester\\'s translation of the Arabic \"Book of the Composition of Alchemy\". Although European craftsmen and technicians pre-existed, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy (though here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself) was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo, Spain, through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath. Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum, and the works of Avicenna and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.\\nMeanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century St\\xa0Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, Peter Abelard followed Anselm\\'s work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, Robert Grosseteste used Abelard\\'s methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.\\nThrough much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms. Albertus Magnus, a Dominican friar, is known to have written works such as the \"Book of Minerals\" where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist. Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert\\'s student Thomas Aquinas.\\nRoger Bacon, a Franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics, comparative linguistics, and medicine, composed his \"Great Work\" () for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy\\'s connections to soteriology and Christian theology. Bacon\\'s writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy. Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical confirmed the theoretical, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine. In later European legend, he became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner\\'s questions.\\nSoon after Bacon, the influential work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His \"Summa Perfectionis\" remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man\\'s soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man\\'s soul, man could be reunited with God.\\nIn the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves. Dante, Piers Plowman, and Chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. Pope John XXII\\'s 1317 edict, \"Spondent quas non-exhibent\" forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists. Roman Catholic Inquisitor General Nicholas Eymerich\\'s \"Directorium Inquisitorum\", written in 1376, associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals, which Eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture. This did not, however, lead to any change in the Inquisition\\'s monitoring or prosecution of alchemists. In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus, John of Rupescissa, and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.\\nNicolas Flamel is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Although the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher\\'s stone. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of \\'his\\' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher\\'s stone. Through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers\\' stone. Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.\\nRenaissance and early modern Europe.\\nDuring the Renaissance, Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.\\nIn the late 15th century, Marsilio Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. Renaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.\\nEsoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala. A key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his \"De Occulta Philosophia\", he attempted to merge Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.\\nParacelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa\\'s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, \"Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.\"\\nHis hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. Iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.\\nJohn Dee (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa\\'s occult tradition. Although better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as astrologer, cryptographer, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I, Dee\\'s alchemical \"Monas Hieroglyphica\", written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work. His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom \"As above so below\". During the 17th century, a short-lived \"supernatural\" interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the Royal Society: Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher\\'s stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.\\nEntrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley. King James IV of Scotland, Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists. John\\'s son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book \"Fasciculus Chemicus\".\\nAlthough most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. \"Betrüger\" would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the con artists. False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.\\nThe terms \"chemia\" and \"alchemia\" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations, had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute. Michael Sendivogius (\"Michał Sędziwój\", 1566–1636), a Polish alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see Isaac Newton\\'s occult studies) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include Robert Boyle, and Jan Baptist van Helmont. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.\\nLater modern period.\\nThe decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for \"ancient wisdom\". Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 James Price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: \"Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof.\"\\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant. This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of Lavoisier and John Dalton.\\nBeginning around 1720, a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between \"alchemy\" and \"chemistry\". By the 1740s, \"alchemy\" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud. In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the 18th-century scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to divorce and separate the \"new\" chemistry from the \"old\" practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\\nDuring the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science. The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience. This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.\\nIn the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: \"No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy.\" Atwood\\'s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner. Hitchcock, in his \"Remarks Upon Alchymists\" (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron Carl Reichenbach, published his studies on Odic force, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.\\nIn 1946, Louis Cattiaux published the Message Retrouvé, a work that was at once philosophical, mystical and highly influenced by alchemy. In his lineage, many researchers, including Emmanuel and Charles d\\'Hooghvorst, are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium.\\nWomen.\\nSeveral women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. Michael Maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers\\' stone: Mary the Jewess, Cleopatra the Alchemist, Medera, and Taphnutia. Zosimos\\' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and Isis the Prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts.\\nThe first alchemist whose name we know was Mary the Jewess (). Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry. Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes. The laboratory water-bath, known eponymously (especially in France) as the bain-marie, is said to have been invented or at least improved by her. Essentially a double-boiler, it was (and is) used in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating. The tribikos (a modified distillation apparatus) and the kerotakis (a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her. Although we have no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the early-fourth-century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis. After the Greco-Roman period, women\\'s names appear less frequently in alchemical literature.\\nTowards the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Renaissance, due to the emergence of print, women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries. Caterina Sforza, the Countess of Forlì and Lady of Imola, is one of the few confirmed female alchemists after Mary the Jewess. As she owned an apothecary, she would practice science and conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories. Being knowledgable in alchemy and pharmacology, she recorded all of her alchemical ventures in a manuscript named (\\'Experiments\\'). The manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes covering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine. One of these recipes was for the water of talc. Talc, which makes up talcum powder, is a mineral which, when combined with water and distilled, was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits. These supposed benefits included turning silver to gold and rejuvenation. When combined with white wine, its powder form could be ingested to counteract poision. Furthermore, if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine, it was said to be a source of protection from any poison, sickness, or plague. Other recipes were for making hair dyes, lotions, lip colors. There was also information on how to treat a variety of ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer. In addition, there were instructions on producing the quintessence (or aether), an elixir which was believed to be able to heal all sicknesses, defend against diseases, and perpetuate youthfulness. She also wrote about creating the illustrious philosophers\\' stone.\\nDue to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. As the sixteenth century went on, scientific culture flourished and people began collecting \"secrets\". During this period \"secrets\" referred to experiments, and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre, but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome. Some women known for their interest in alchemy were Catherine de\\' Medici, the Queen of France, and Marie de\\' Medici, the following Queen of France, who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory. Also, Isabella d\\'Este, the Marchioness of Mantua, made perfumes herself to serve as gifts. In this period, the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was (\\'The Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese\\'). This book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold, medicine, and cosmetics. However, it is rumored that a man, Girolamo Ruscelli, was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers. This contributed to a bigger problem in which male authors would credit prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience. For example, in (\"Gallant Recipe-Book\"), the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to Elisabetta Gonzaga, the duchess of Urbino. In the same book, Isabella d\\'Aragona, the daughter of Alfonso II of Naples, is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury. Ippolita Maria Sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones.\\nMary Anne Atwood\\'s \"A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery\" (1850) marks the return of women during the nineteenth-century occult revival.\\nModern historical research.\\nThe history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study. As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and philosophy, the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, kabbalism, spiritualism, Rosicrucianism, and other mystic movements. Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University, the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (ESSWE), and the University of Amsterdam\\'s Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam. A recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold. The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.\\nJournals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include \\'Ambix\\', published by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, and \\'Isis\\', published by The History of Science Society.\\nCore concepts.\\nWestern alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from Neoplatonism and earlier Greek cosmology. As such, the classical elements appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher\\'s stone.\\nMagnum opus.\\nThe Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.\\nModernity.\\nDue to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry, the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the \\'decknamen\\' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts. At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as Florin George Călian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.\\nNew interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements. Groups like the Rosicrucians and Freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, \"occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances\", which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought.\\nEsoteric interpretations of historical texts.\\nIn the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and Neo-Hermeticist practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. In this interpretation, transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.\\nAccording to this view, early alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis () highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul. This approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of \\'Alchemical Formulas\\' were like a veil, hiding their true spiritual philosophy. In the Neo-Hermeticist interpretation, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher\\'s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist, the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are held to have been written according to this view, the cryptic alchemical symbols, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.\\nIn his 1766 \"Alchemical Catechism\", Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:\\nPsychology.\\nAlchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\", a Chinese alchemical text translated by his friend Richard Wilhelm, he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in his patients\\' dreams, visions, or fantasies. He observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation, a process that Jung called \"individuation.\" Specifically, he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or Lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this \"process of individuation.\" Together with his alchemical \"mystica soror\" (mystical sister) Jungian Swiss analyst Marie-Louise von Franz, Jung began collecting old alchemical texts, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references, and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy\\'s popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the \"hieros gamos\", or divine marriage. His writings are influential in general psychology, but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols, and the unconscious archetypal forces (archetypes) that comprise all psychic life.\\nBoth von Franz and Jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Among the volumes Jung wrote on alchemy, his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, \"Mysterium Coniunctionis\".\\nLiterature.\\nAlchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. \"Literary alchemy\" appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to J. K. Rowling, and also the popular Japanese manga \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir Terry Pratchett.\\nVisual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.\\nScience.\\nOne goal of alchemy, the transmutation of base substances into gold, is now known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means. Although not financially worthwhile, Gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as 1941.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"579\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=579\" title=\"Alien\">\\nAlien\\n\\nAlien primarily refers to:\\nAlien(s), or The Alien(s) may also refer to:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"580\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=580\" title=\"Astronomer\">\\nAstronomer\\n\\nAn astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth. They observe astronomical objects such as stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies – in either observational (by analyzing the data) or theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. A related but distinct subject is physical cosmology, which studies the Universe as a whole.\\nTypes.\\nAstronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and theoretical. Observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work.\\nFurther subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy, galactic astronomy, or physical cosmology.\\nAcademic.\\nHistorically, astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms \"astronomer\" and \"astrophysicist\" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities. They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.\\nThe American Astronomical Society, which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy. The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.\\nContrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time. Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers\\' time.\\nAstronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field.\\nThose who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write, and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics.\\nAmateur astronomers.\\nWhile there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among amateurs. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations. Like any hobby, most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called \"armchair astronomers\" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"583\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=583\" title=\"Ameboid stage\">\\nAmeboid stage\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"586\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586\" title=\"ASCII\">\\nASCII\\n\\nASCII ( ), abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented, ASCII has just 128 code points, of which only 95 are , which severely limited its scope. All modern computer systems instead use Unicode, which has millions of code points, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set.\\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding. \\nASCII is one of the IEEE milestones.\\nOverview.\\nASCII was developed from telegraph code. Its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association\\'s (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters.\\nThe use of ASCII format for Network Interchange was described in 1969. That document was formally elevated to an Internet Standard in 2015.\\nOriginally based on the (modern) English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above. Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits \"0\" to \"9\", lowercase letters \"a\" to \"z\", uppercase letters \"A\" to \"Z\", and punctuation symbols. In addition, the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing control codes which originated with Teletype machines; most of these are now obsolete, although a few are still commonly used, such as the carriage return, line feed, and tab codes.\\nFor example, lowercase \"i\" would be represented in the ASCII encoding by binary 1101001 = hexadecimal 69 (\"i\" is the ninth letter) = decimal 105.\\nDespite being an American standard, ASCII does not have a code point for the cent (¢). It also does not support English terms with diacritical marks such as résumé and jalapeño, or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as Beyoncé.\\nHistory.\\nThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee\\'s X3.2.4 working group (now INCITS). The ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI), and ultimately became the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\\nWith the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code. There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet. The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to \"sticks\" 6 and 7, and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard. The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting. Locating the lowercase letters in \"sticks\" 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.\\nThe X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the brace and vertical bar characters), renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed). ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967, then USAS X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.\\nRevisions of the ASCII standard:\\nIn the X3.15 standard, the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (least significant bit first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a 9-track standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some punched card formats.\\nDesign considerations.\\nBit width.\\nThe X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols (i.e. graphemes and control characters). This allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters, 10 numerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT) International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) standard of 1924, FIELDATA (1956), and early EBCDIC (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.\\nITA2 was in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code that Émile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.\\nThe committee debated the possibility of a shift function (like in ITA2), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission, as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.\\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits (octets) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired. Eight-bit machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.\\nInternal organization.\\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two so-called \"ASCII sticks\" (32 positions) were reserved for control characters. The \"space\" character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier, so it became position 20hex; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64-character alphabets, and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes, as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code (1963). Lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter \"A\" was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard. The digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward.\\nMany of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on \"mechanical\" typewriters, not \"electric\" typewriters. Mechanical typewriters followed the de facto standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted \"0\" and \"1\", using \"O\" (capital letter \"o\") and \"l\" (lowercase letter \"L\") instead, but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII codice_5 were placed in the second stick, positions 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick. The parentheses could not correspond to \"9\" and \"0\", however, because the place corresponding to \"0\" was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing codice_6 (underscore) from \"6\" and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with \"8\" and \"9\". This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, differently from traditional mechanical typewriters. \\nElectric typewriters, notably the IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The codice_7 pair also dates to the No. 2, and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift codice_9 (comma) or codice_10 (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the codice_11 pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly codice_12) to codice_13.\\nSome then-common typewriter characters were not included, notably codice_14, while codice_15 were included as diacritics for international use, and codice_16 for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters codice_17 (in addition to common codice_18). The \"@\" symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented \"À\" in the French variation, so the \"@\" was placed in position 40hex, right before the letter A.\\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), end of message (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), \"who are you?\" (WRU), \"are you?\" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the Hamming distance between their bit patterns.\\nCharacter order.\\nASCII-code order is also called \"ASCIIbetical\" order. Collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than \"standard\" alphabetical order (collating sequence). The main deviations in ASCII order are:\\nAn intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.\\nCharacter groups.\\nControl characters.\\nASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for control characters: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.\\nFor example, character 10 represents the \"line feed\" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents \"backspace\". refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters. Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as markup languages, address page and document layout and formatting.\\nThe original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream, and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of \"delete\".\\nProbably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (delete) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (control-O, shift in) interpreted as \"delete previous character\" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.\\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-Q (XON, transmit on) caused the tape reader to resume. This so-called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a \"handshaking\" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems, control-S retains its meaning but control-Q is replaced by a second control-S to resume output. \\nThe 33 ASR also could be configured to employ control-R (DC2) and control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.\\nDelete vs backspace.\\nThe Teletype could not move its typehead backwards, so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead, there was a key marked that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually-input paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored. Teletypes were commonly used with the less-expensive computers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC); these systems had to use what keys were available, and thus the DEL code was assigned to erase the previous character. Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked \"Backspace\" while the separate key marked \"Delete\" sent an escape sequence; many other competing terminals sent a BS code for the backspace key. \\nThe Unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character, this could be set to BS \"or\" DEL, but not both, resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using (shells that allow line editing, such as ksh, bash, and zsh, understand both). The assumption that no key sent a BS code allowed control+H to be used for other purposes, such as the \"help\" prefix command in GNU Emacs.\\nEscape.\\nMany more of the control codes have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones. The \"escape\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning, an \"escape sequence\". This is the same meaning of \"escape\" encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this interpretation has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. \\nIn modern usage, an ESC sent \"to\" the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called \"ANSI escape code\" (or, more properly, a \"Control Sequence Introducer\") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a \"[\" (left-bracket) character. In contrast, an ESC sent \"from\" the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation or special mode, as in the TECO and vi text editors. In graphical user interface (GUI) and windowing systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit (terminate) altogether.\\nEnd of line.\\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring \"plain text\" files between systems. The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both \"carriage return\" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and \"line feed\" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name \"carriage return\" comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary. The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the paper for the next line.\\nDEC operating systems (OS/8, RT-11, RSX-11, RSTS, TOPS-10, etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines) would work. By the time so-called \"glass TTYs\" (later called CRTs or \"dumb terminals\") came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it. When Gary Kildall created CP/M, he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in DEC\\'s RT-11 operating system. \\nUntil the introduction of PC DOS in 1981, IBM had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC encoding instead of ASCII, and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of \"carriage return\" was meaningless. IBM\\'s PC DOS (also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M, and Windows in turn inherited it from MS-DOS.\\nRequiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself. To simplify matters, plain text data streams, including files, on Multics used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator. Unix and Unix-like systems, and Amiga systems, adopted this convention from Multics. On the other hand, the original Macintosh OS, Apple DOS, and ProDOS used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the Unix-based macOS operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack TRS-80 also used a lone CR to terminate lines.\\nComputers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and TENEX using CR-LF line endings; machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings; and machines running operating systems such as OS/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used EBCDIC rather than ASCII encoding. The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII \"Network Virtual Terminal\" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT. The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode. This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT\\'s CR-LF line-ending convention.\\nEnd of file/stream.\\nThe PDP-6 monitor, and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10, used control-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal. Some operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks, and used control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file. For these reasons, EOF, or end-of-file, was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-Z instead of SUBstitute. The end-of-text code (ETX), also known as control-C, was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to its position at the end of the alphabet, and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.\\nIn C library and Unix conventions, the null character is used to terminate text strings; such null-terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for \"zero\".\\nControl code chart.\\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example ISO 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers.\\nPrintable characters.\\nCodes 20hex to 7Ehex, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.\\nCode 20hex, the \"space\" character, denotes the space between words, as produced by the space bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section.\\nCode 7Fhex corresponds to the non-printable \"delete\" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section\\'s chart. Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret (5Ehex) and the left arrow instead of the underscore (5Fhex).\\n]]\\nUsage.\\nASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph\\'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2, which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system. Bob Bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence. His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer, \"so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the \"Bemer–Ross Code\" in Europe\". Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called \"the father of ASCII\".\\nOn March 11, 1968, US President Lyndon B. Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States Federal Government support ASCII, stating:\\nI have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce [Luther H. Hodges] regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.\\nAll computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.\\nASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007, when UTF-8 encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII.\\nVariants and derivations.\\nAs computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as \"ASCII extensions\", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII\\'s character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.\\n7-bit codes.\\nFrom early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.\\nOther international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom\\'s pound sterling (£); e.g. with code page 1104. Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.\\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. é, ñ, ß, Ł), currency symbols (e.g. £, ¥), etc. See also YUSCII (Yugoslavia).\\nIt would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for \"national use\". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO\\'s first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII\\'s choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.\\nISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.\\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to \"national use\" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and, thus, read, something such as\\ninstead of\\nC trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C, although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or Usenet) contained \"{, }\" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get \"N{ jag har sm|rg}sar\" as the answer, which should be \"Nä jag har smörgåsar\" meaning \"No I\\'ve got sandwiches\".\\nIn Japan and Korea, still a variation of ASCII is used, in which the backslash (5C hex) is rendered as ¥ (a Yen sign, in Japan) or ₩ (a Won sign, in Korea). This means that, for example, the file path C:\\\\Users\\\\Smith is shown as C:¥Users¥Smith (in Japan) or C:₩Users₩Smith (in Korea).\\n8-bit codes.\\nEventually, as 8-, 16-, and 32-bit (and later 64-bit) computers began to replace 12-, 18-, and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.\\nEncodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.\\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. Kaypro CP/M computers used the \"upper\" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.\\nThe PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer. Atari 8-bit computers and Galaksija computers also used ASCII variants.\\nThe IBM PC defined code page 437, which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware. Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.\\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, Windows-1252 (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing. ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common.\\nISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.\\nUnicode.\\nUnicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using natural numbers called \"code points\") and encoding (to 8-, 16-, or 32-bit binary formats, called UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, respectively).\\nASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters. Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"589\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=589\" title=\"Ashmore And Cartier Islands\">\\nAshmore And Cartier Islands\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"590\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590\" title=\"Austin (disambiguation)\">\\nAustin (disambiguation)\\n\\nAustin is the capital of Texas in the United States.\\nAustin may also refer to:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"593\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593\" title=\"Animation\">\\nAnimation\\n\\nAnimation is a method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.\\nA cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life.\\nThe illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.\\nAnalog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.\\nIn addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects.\\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.\\nEtymology.\\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"animātiōn\", stem of \"animātiō\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\". The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\\nHistory.\\nBefore cinematography.\\nHundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry, automata, shadow play, and the magic lantern. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in European theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion.\\nIn 1833, the stroboscopic disc (better known as the phénakisticope) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures. Series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years, but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements. The stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope (1866), the flip book (1868) and the praxinoscope (1877). A typical 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually. The flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds. The first to create much longer sequences seems to have been Charles-Émile Reynaud, who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long \"Pantomimes Lumineuses\".\\nSilent era.\\nWhen cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. Animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys, with chromolithography film loops (often traced from live-action footage) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home. It would take some more years before animation reached movie theaters.\\nAfter earlier experiments by movie pioneers J. Stuart Blackton, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, Segundo de Chomón, and Edwin S. Porter (among others), Blackton\\'s \"The Haunted Hotel\" (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail, without signs of any known stage trick.\\nÉmile Cohl\\'s \"Fantasmagorie\" (1908) is the oldest known example of a standard cinematographic film composed entirely of what became known as traditional (hand-drawn) animation. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by Ladislas Starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by Winsor McCay with detailed drawn animation in films such as \"Little Nemo\" (1911) and \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" (1914).\\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"cartoons\" became an industry in the US. Successful producer John Randolph Bray and animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century. Felix the Cat, who debuted in 1919, became the first fully realized animal character in the history of American film animation.\\nAmerican golden age.\\nIn 1928, \"Steamboat Willie\", featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, popularized film with synchronized sound and put Walt Disney\\'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. Although Disney Animation\\'s actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very small, the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the \"aesthetic norms\" of animation ever since. \\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of American animation that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including Walt Disney Productions\\' Goofy (1932) and Donald Duck (1934), Warner Bros. Cartoons\\' Looney Tunes characters like Porky Pig (1935), Daffy Duck (1937), Bugs Bunny (1938–1940), Tweety (1941–1942), Sylvester the Cat (1945), Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner (1949), Fleischer Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios\\' Betty Boop (1930), Popeye (1933), Superman (1941) and Casper (1945), MGM cartoon studio\\'s Tom and Jerry (1940) and Droopy, Walter Lantz Productions/Universal Studio Cartoons\\' Woody Woodpecker (1940), Terrytoons/20th Century Fox\\'s Gandy Goose (1938), Dinky Duck (1939), Mighty Mouse (1942) and Heckle and Jeckle (1946) and United Artists\\' Pink Panther (1963).\\nFeatures before CGI.\\nIn 1917, Italian-Argentine director Quirino Cristiani made the first feature-length film \"El Apóstol\" (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani\\'s \"Sin dejar rastros\" in 1918, but one day after its premiere, the film was confiscated by the government.\\nAfter working on it for three years, Lotte Reiniger released the German feature-length silhouette animation \"Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed\" in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\\nIn 1937, Walt Disney Studios premiered their first animated feature, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features . The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with \"Gulliver\\'s Travels\" with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney\\'s next features \"Pinocchio\", \"Fantasia\" (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios\\' second animated feature \"Mr. Bug Goes to Town\" (1941–1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterward, Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until Ralph Bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with \"An American Tail\" in 1986.\\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney\\'s features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques. Russia\\'s Soyuzmultfilm animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France, and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation.\\nTelevision.\\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most developed countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching Saturday-morning cartoons. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. Hanna-Barbera Productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as \"The Flintstones\" (1960–1966) (the first prime time animated series), \"Scooby-Doo\" (since 1969) and Belgian co-production \"The Smurfs\" (1981–1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as \"The Simpsons\" (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\\nWhile US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation. Japanese anime TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as \"Barbapapa\" (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977), \"Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ (Vicky the Viking)\" (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), and \"The Jungle Book\" (Italy/Japan 1989).\\nSwitch from cels to computers.\\nComputer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller \"Futureworld\" (1976).\\n\"The Rescuers Down Under\" was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera. It was produced in a style that\\'s very similar to traditional cel animation on the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), developed by The Walt Disney Company in collaboration with Pixar in the late 1980s.\\nThe so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, became the dominant technique following the release of Pixar\\'s \"Toy Story\" (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.\\nMost of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.\\nEconomic status.\\nIn 2010, the animation market was estimated to be worth circa US$80 billion. By 2020, the value had increased to an estimated US$270 billion. Animated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins (around 52%) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013. Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s.\\nEducation, propaganda and commercials.\\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment.\\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. Many American studios, including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts.\\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as Snap, Crackle and Pop in advertisements for Kellogg\\'s cereals. Tex Avery was the producer of the first Raid \"Kills Bugs Dead\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.\\nOther media, merchandise and theme parks.\\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.\\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen (which is often the case in Japan, where many manga are adapted into anime), original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for video games (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from films and vice versa.\\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children\\'s books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children\\'s writing tablet in 1929, their Mickey Mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products, as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some pejorative use of Mickey\\'s name, but licensed Disney products sell well, and the so-called Disneyana has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\\nDisneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney\\'s cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Disney\\'s earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\\nCriticism.\\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films. Criticisms regarding cultural representation and psychological effects on children have been raised around the animation industry, which some claim has remained politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.\\nAwards.\\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. Many are part of general or regional film award programs, like the China\\'s Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation (since 1981). Awards programs dedicated to animation, with many categories, include ASIFA-Hollywood\\'s Annie Awards, the Emile Awards in Europe and the Anima Mundi awards in Brazil.\\nAcademy Awards.\\nApart from Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film (since 1932) and Best Animated Feature (since 2002), animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories, relatively often for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.\\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture, in 1991. \"Up\" (2009) and \"Toy Story 3\" (2010) also received Best Picture nominations, after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\\nProduction.\\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of filmmaking, with certain unique aspects. Traits common to both live-action and animated feature-length films are labor intensity and high production costs.\\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films. It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation). It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film. Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).\\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film\\'s consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film. Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.\\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles. On traditionally animated projects, maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.\\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film. In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\\nTechniques.\\nTraditional.\\nTraditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators\\' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film.\\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators\\' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional 35\\xa0mm film and newer media with digital video. The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the character animators\\' work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years. Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include \"Pinocchio\" (United States, 1940), \"Animal Farm\" (United Kingdom, 1954), \"Lucky and Zorba\" (Italy, 1998), and \"The Illusionist\" (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include \"The Lion King\" (US, 1994), \"The Prince of Egypt\" (US, 1998), \"Akira\" (Japan, 1988), \"Spirited Away\" (Japan, 2001), \"The Triplets of Belleville\" (France, 2003), and \"The Secret of Kells\" (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\\nFull.\\nFull animation is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement, having a smooth animation. Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the Walt Disney studio (\"The Little Mermaid\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\") to the more \\'cartoon\\' styles of the Warner Bros. animation studio. Many of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, \"The Secret of NIMH\" (US, 1982), \"The Iron Giant\" (US, 1999), and \"Nocturna\" (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are often animated on \"twos\", sometimes on \"ones\", which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film. \\nLimited.\\nLimited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation. Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America, limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in \"Gerald McBoing-Boing\" (US, 1951), \"Yellow Submarine\" (UK, 1968), and certain anime produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, and other TV animation studios) and later the Internet (web cartoons).\\nRotoscoping.\\nRotoscoping is a technique patented by Max Fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors\\' outlines into animated drawings, as in \"The Lord of the Rings\" (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in \"Waking Life\" (US, 2001) and \"A Scanner Darkly\" (US, 2006). Some other examples are \"Fire and Ice\" (US, 1983), \"Heavy Metal\" (1981), and \"Aku no Hana\" (Japan, 2013).\\nLive-action blending.\\nLive-action/animation is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots. One of the earlier uses was in Koko the Clown when Koko was drawn over live-action footage. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of \"Alice Comedies\" (1923–1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include \"Allegro Non Troppo\" (Italy, 1976), \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (US, 1988), \"Volere volare\" (Italy 1991), \"Space Jam\" (US, 1996) and \"Osmosis Jones\" (US, 2001).\\nStop motion.\\nStop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.\\nComputer.\\nComputer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer. 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.\\n2D.\\n2D animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D bitmap graphics and 2D vector graphics. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, interpolated morphing, onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping.\\n2D animation has many applications, including analog computer animation, Flash animation, and PowerPoint animation. Cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated GIF file of which part is animated.\\nFinal line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation, to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department. Speaking about using this approach in \"Paperman\", John Kahrs said that \"Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm.\"\\n3D.\\n3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The 3D model maker usually starts by creating a 3D polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate. A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment. Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices. This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement.\\nOther techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and water simulations. These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"594\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=594\" title=\"Apollo\">\\nApollo\\n\\nApollo is one of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the \"kouros\" (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \"Apulu\".\\nAs the patron deity of Delphi (\"Apollo Pythios\"), Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the \"averter of evil\".\\nMedicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows. Apollo\\'s capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a protector of the young (), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age () and dedicated to Apollo.\\nApollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over colonists. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city.\\nAs the god of \"mousike\", Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as \"Apollo Helios\" he became identified among Greeks with Helios, the personification of the Sun. In Latin texts, however, there was no conflation of Apollo with Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE. Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.\\nEtymology.\\nApollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , ( ); Doric: , ; Arcadocypriot: , ; Aeolic: , ; )\\nThe name \"Apollo\"—unlike the related older name \"Paean\"—is generally not found in the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form \"]pe-rjo-[\" (Linear B: ]-[) on the KN E 842 tablet, though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read \"Hyperion\" ([u]-pe-rjo-[ne]).\\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain. The spelling ( in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form, (), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month \"Apellaios\" (), and the offerings () at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival (). According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word (), which originally meant \"wall,\" \"fence for animals\" and later \"assembly within the limits of the square.\" Apella () is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the (). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *\"Apalyun\".\\nSeveral instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo\\'s name with the Greek verb (), \"to destroy\". Plato in \"Cratylus\" connects the name with (), \"redemption\", with (\"apolousis\"), \"purification\", and with (), \"simple\", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, , and finally with (), \"ever-shooting\". Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric (), which means \"assembly\", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation (), \"fold\", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds. In the ancient Macedonian language () means \"stone,\" and some toponyms may be derived from this word: (Pella, the capital of ancient Macedonia) and (\"Pellēnē\"/\"Pellene\").\\nThe Hittite form \"Apaliunas\" (\"d\") is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter. The Hittite testimony reflects an early form \"\", which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . The name of the Lydian god \"Qλdãns\" /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y \"&gt;\" d. Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric \"Ἀπέλjων\" and Hittite \"Apaliunas\".\\nA Luwian etymology suggested for \"Apaliunas\" makes Apollo \"The One of Entrapment\", perhaps in the sense of \"Hunter\".\\nGreco-Roman epithets.\\nApollo\\'s chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , \"Phoibos\" ), literally \"bright\". It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo\\'s role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in Latin literature.\\nOrigin and birth.\\nApollo\\'s birthplace was Mount Cynthus on the island of Delos.\\nPlace of worship.\\nDelphi and Actium were his primary places of worship.\\nCeltic epithets and cult titles.\\nApollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire. In the traditionally Celtic lands, he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with Celtic gods of similar character.\\nOrigins.\\nThe cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo\\'s twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent Python. For the Greeks, Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods, and through the centuries he acquired different functions. In Archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with \"healing\". In Classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil. Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed \"a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.\"\\nHealer and god-protector from evil.\\nIn classical times, his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and he was therefore called \"apotropaios\" (, \"averting evil\") and \"alexikakos\" ( \"keeping off ill\"; from v. + n. ). Apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer. Some commonly-used examples are \"paion\" ( literally \"healer\" or \"helper\") \"epikourios\" (, \"succouring\"), \"oulios\" (, \"healer, baleful\") and \"loimios\" (, \"of the plague\"). In later writers, the word, \"paion\", usually spelled \"Paean\", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.\\nApollo in his aspect of \"healer\" has a connection to the primitive god Paean (), who did not have a cult of his own. Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the \"Iliad\", and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion. It is suggested, though unconfirmed, that he is connected to the Mycenaean figure \"pa-ja-wo-ne\" (Linear B: ). Paean was the personification of holy songs sung by \"seer-doctors\" (), which were supposed to cure disease.\\nHomer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph. Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollo\\'s son Asclepius the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo\\'s role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.\\nIn the \"Iliad\", Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra. He sends a plague () to the Achaeans. Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent, they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows, called a hecatomb.\\nDorian origin.\\nThe \"Homeric Hymn to Apollo\" depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north. The connection with the northern-dwelling Dorians and their initiation festival \"apellai\" is reinforced by the month \"Apellaios\" in northwest Greek calendars. The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (Doric: ). \"Apellaios\" is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the \"megistos kouros\" (the great Kouros). However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word \"pella\" (Pella), \"stone\". Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).\\nMinoan origin.\\nGeorge Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon, worshipped in Crete, to have originated at Delphi. In the \"Homeric Hymn\", Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. \"Apollo Delphinios\" or \"Delphidios\" was a sea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands. Apollo\\'s sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan \"Mistress of the animals\". In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the \"Master of the animals\", a bow-wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo.\\nAnatolian origin.\\nA non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship. The name of Apollo\\'s mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts. These rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites, and from there into Greece.\\nHomer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to \"Appaliunas\", a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete. The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of \"Artimus\" (Artemis) and \"Qλdãns\", whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving Lydian texts\".\" However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of \"Qλdãns\" with Apollo.\\nThe Greeks gave to him the name \"agyieus\" as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column. However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (\"sibutu\") indicates a Babylonian origin.\\nThe Late Bronze Age (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) Hittite and Hurrian \"Aplu\" was a god of plague, invoked during plague years. Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning \"the son of\", was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash. Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god () who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods. In \"Iliad\", his priest prays to \"Apollo Smintheus\", the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats. All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.\\nProto-Indo-European.\\nThe Vedic Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called \"the archer\" and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva. Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god. However the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.\\nOracular cult.\\nUnusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality. Lycia was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian. Apollo\\'s cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as \"Apollodorus\" or \"Apollonios\" and cities named \"Apollonia\" testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Claros pronounced the so-called \"theological oracles\", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity. \"In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. Julian the Apostate (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.\"\\nOracular shrines.\\nApollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Claros and Didyma. His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet \"Abaeus\" (, \"Apollon Abaios\"), was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.\\nHis oracular shrines include:\\nOracles were also given by sons of Apollo.\\nTemples of Apollo.\\nMany temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.\\nThe Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn\\'t be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.\\nThe most important temples are:\\nMythology.\\nApollo appears often in the myths, plays and hymns. As Zeus\\' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.\\nBirth.\\nApollo was the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife or one of his mistresses. Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and Aletheia, the personification of truth.\\nWhen Zeus\\' wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant, she banned Leto from giving birth on \"terra firma\". Leto sought shelter in many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named Delos that had once been Asteria, Leto\\'s own sister. Since it was neither a mainland nor an island, Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree. All the goddesses except Hera were present to witness the event. It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long.\\nWhen Apollo was born, clutching a golden sword, everything on Delos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance. Swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight. He was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him. Since Leto was unable to feed him, Themis, the goddess of divine law, fed him with nectar, or ambrosia. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind. Zeus, who had calmed Hera by then, came and adorned his son with a golden headband.\\nApollo\\'s birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth. Leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the Delians. According to some, Apollo secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time. This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.\\nApollo was born on the seventh day (, \"hebdomagenes\") of the month Thargelion—according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him. Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo or was born on the island of Ortygia then helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.\\nHyperborea.\\nHyperborea, the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted Pythian games. There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called \"the garden of Apollo\". Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans. His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time. He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The \"Theophania\" festival was held in Delphi to celebrate his return.\\nIt is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo\\'s winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet \"Lyceus\", meaning \"wolf-like\". But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo\\'s cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman. Shamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.\\nIn myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died became the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the Cyclopes. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.\\nChildhood and youth.\\nAs a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later came to be known as Archegetes, \"the founder (of towns)\" and god who guided men to build new cities. From his father Zeus, Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans.\\nIn his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by Thriae, the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills. Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery. Phoebe, his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift. Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon.\\nPython.\\nPython, a chthonic serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the Delphic Oracle, whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto\\'s womb. Python was the nurse of the giant Typhon. In most of the traditions, Apollo was still a child when he killed Python.\\nPython was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant Leto to death, and had assaulted her. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from Hephaestus. The Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during the battle with the cry \"Hie Paean\". After Apollo was victorious, they also brought him gifts and gave the Corycian cave to him. According to Homer, Apollo had encountered and killed the Python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine.\\nAccording to another version, when Leto was in Delphi, Python had attacked her. Apollo defended his mother and killed Python. Euripides in his \"Iphigenia in Aulis\" gives an account of his fight with Python and the event\\'s aftermath. \\nA detailed account of Apollo\\'s conflict with Gaia and Zeus\\' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given. \\nApollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his, a wish that Zeus granted him readily. Because of this, Athena, who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles, cast her pebbles away in displeasure.\\nHowever, Apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified. Because Python was a child of Gaia, Gaia wanted Apollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment. Zeus didn\\'t agree and instead exiled his son from Olympus, and instructed him to get purified. Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years. After the servitude was over, as per his father\\'s order, he travelled to the Vale of Tempe to bath in waters of Peneus. There Zeus himself performed purificatory rites on Apollo. Purified, Apollo was escorted by his half sister Athena to Delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaia. According to a variation, Apollo had also travelled to Crete, where Carmanor purified him. Apollo later established the Pythian games to appropriate Gaia. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.\\nSoon after, Zeus instructed Apollo to go to Delphi and establish his law. But Apollo, disobeying his father, went to the land of Hyperborea and stayed there for a year. He returned only after the Delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back. Zeus, pleased with his son\\'s integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gave to Apollo various gifts, like a golden tripod, a golden bow and arrows, a golden chariot and the city of Delphi.\\nSoon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The Pythia was Apollo\\'s high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals.\\nTityos.\\nHera once again sent another giant, Tityos to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to other version, Artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows. After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver.\\nAdmetus.\\nAdmetus was the king of Pherae, who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay. After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.\\nBecause Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo\\'s mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins. Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias, by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus\\' chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister. When Apollo learnt of Admetus\\' untimely death, he convinced or tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time.\\nAccording to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo\\'s son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus for this, but his mother Leto intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor once again under Admetus.\\nThe love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius.\\nNiobe.\\nThe fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto\\'s womb. Niobe was the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion. She displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo\\'s effeminate appearance and Artemis\\' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe\\'s sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.\\nA devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river Achelous. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.\\nWhen Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son Nestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.\\nBuilding the walls of Troy.\\nOnce Apollo and Poseidon served under the Trojan king Laomedon in accordance to Zeus\\' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris. Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy. Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid\\'s account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.\\nIn Pindar\\'s odes, the gods took a mortal named Aeacus as their assistant. When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that Troy would fall at the hands of Aeacus\\'s descendants, the Aeacidae (i.e. his son Telamon joined Heracles when he sieged the city during Laomedon\\'s rule. Later, his great-grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy).\\nHowever, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster Cetus. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione (who would later be saved by Heracles).\\nDuring his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.\\nTrojan War.\\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan War waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.\\nDuring the war, the Greek king Agamemnon captured Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo\\'s priest Chryses, and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the \"anger of Achilles\", which is the theme of the \"Iliad\".\\nReceiving the aegis from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father\\'s command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as \"the rouser of armies\" because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.\\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn\\'t fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.\\nWhen the Greek hero Diomedes injured the Trojan hero Aeneas, Aphrodite tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy, where he was healed.\\nAfter the death of Sarpedon, a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father\\'s wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.\\nThe Trojan hero Hector (who, according to some, was the god\\'s own son by Hecuba) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector\\'s fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles\\' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse, shielding it from the rays of the sun.\\nApollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son Tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son Troilus in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles\\' attempt to mutilate Hector\\'s dead body.\\nFinally, Apollo caused Achilles\\' death by guiding an arrow shot by Paris into Achilles\\' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.\\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors, including Agenor, Polydamas, Glaucus in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.\\nHeracles.\\nAfter Heracles (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king Eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him as Heracles.\\nTo complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the Ceryneian Hind, a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring back it alive. After chasing the hind for one year, the animal eventually got tired, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon, Heracles captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.\\nAfter he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under Omphale, queen of Lydia for one year in order to purify himself.\\nPeriphas.\\nPeriphas was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo\\'s words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas\\' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.\\nPlato\\'s concept of soulmates.\\nA long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and fours legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. Otis and Ephialtes even dared to scale Mount Olympus.\\nTo check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the abdomen, and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call navel today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.\\nNurturer of the young.\\nApollo \"Kourotrophos\" is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the Muses. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.\\nChiron, the abandoned centaur, was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.\\nAsclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.\\nAnius, Apollo\\'s son by Rhoeo, was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.\\nIamus was the son of Apollo and Evadne. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the Moirai to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.\\nIdmon was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the Argonauts, he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son\\'s bravery, Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.\\nApollo adopted Carnus, the abandoned son of Zeus and Europa. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.\\nWhen his son Melaneus reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess Stratonice to be his son\\'s bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.\\nApollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.\\nGod of music.\\nImmediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean, thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. Plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses. According to Socrates, ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called \"Homopolon\" before the \"Homo\" was replaced by \"A\". Apollo\\'s harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator. The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the \"singers of Apollo\". They are Apollo\\'s sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to Hyperborea. Aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.\\nAmong the Pythagoreans, the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity. Their belief was that the music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres.\\nApollo appears as the companion of the Muses, and as Musagetes (\"leader of Muses\") he leads them in dance. They spend their time on Parnassus, which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like Orpheus and Linus.\\nApollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre. In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods, like the marriage of Eros and Psyche, Peleus and Thetis. He is a frequent guest of the Bacchanalia, and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs. Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris.\\nApollo\\'s lyre.\\nThe invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself. Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.\\nMyths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo\\'s cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow\\'s intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre.\\nUpon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.\\nAccording to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas. Hermes\\' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.\\nContest with Pan.\\nOnce Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god Tmolus was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.\\nContest with Marsyas.\\nMarsyas was a satyr who was punished by Apollo for his hubris. He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the Muses, or the nymphs of Nysa. Athena was also present to witness the contest.\\nMarsyas taunted Apollo for \"wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts\". He also further said,\\nThe Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could \"do whatever he wanted\" to the loser.\\nAccording to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo\\'s argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas\\' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.\\nAccording to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack. Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.\\nApollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas\\' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas\\' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo\\'s sons Linus and Orpheus. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea.\\nContest with Cinyras.\\nCinyras was a ruler of Cyprus, who was a friend of Agamemnon. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.\\nPatron of sailors.\\nApollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with Poseidon. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for safe journey.\\nWhen Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.\\nWhen the Argonauts faced a terrible storm, Jason prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed \"Anaphe\", which means \"He revealed it\".\\nApollo helped the Greek hero Diomedes, to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius (\"the embarker\").\\nDuring the Trojan War, Odysseus came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo\\'s priest Chryses, and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.\\nArion was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god\\'s help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.\\nWars.\\nTitanomachy.\\nOnce Hera, out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against Zeus and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb Mount Olympus, Zeus with the help of Apollo, Artemis and Athena, defeated them and cast them into tartarus.\\nTrojan War.\\nApollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon. He killed the Greek heroes Patroclus, Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being Hector. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.\\nTelegony war.\\nA war broke out between the Brygoi and the Thesprotians, who had the support of Odysseus. The gods Athena and Ares came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them.\\nIndian war.\\nWhen Zeus suggested that Dionysus defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of Bacchantes and satyrs. Among the warriors was Aristaeus, Apollo\\'s son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm. After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield. Seeing several of his nymphs and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them. He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.\\nTheban war.\\nDuring the war between the sons of Oedipus, Apollo favored Amphiaraus, a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus\\' last hours glorious by \"lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam\". When Hypseus tried to kill the hero by a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like Melaneus, Antiphus, Aetion, Polites and Lampus. At last when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.\\nSlaying of giants.\\nApollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.\\nGigantomachy.\\nDuring the gigantomachy, Apollo and Heracles blinded the giant Ephialtes by shooting him in his eyes, Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right. He also killed Porphyrion, the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.\\nAloadae.\\nThe Aloadae, namely Otis and Ephialtes, were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods. They attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains, and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land. They even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows. According to another tale, Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them; as they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.\\nPhorbas.\\nPhorbas was a savage giant king of Phlegyas who was described as having swine like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.\\nOther stories.\\nIn the first Olympic games, Apollo defeated Ares and became the victor in wrestling. He outran Hermes in the race and won first place.\\nApollo divides months into summer and winter. He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of Dionysus, and no prophecies were given during winters.\\nMolpadia and Parthenos.\\nMolpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of Rhoeo, a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father\\'s ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father\\'s wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia\\'s name was changed to Hemithea upon her deification.\\nPrometheus.\\nPrometheus was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus\\' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo\\'s words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.\\nThe rock of Leukas.\\nLeukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting out from the island of Leukas into the sea. It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates. A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love.\\nOnce, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis, a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought for the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera.\\nAnother tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.\\nIt was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island. This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.\\nFemale lovers.\\nLove affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology. Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.\\nDaphne was a nymph who scorned Apollo\\'s advances and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and Gaia helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place. According to Roman poet Ovid, the chase was brought about by Cupid, who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred. The myth explains the origin of the laurel and connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at Delphi. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the Pythian games.\\nApollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses, and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed. He fathered the Corybantes by the Muse Thalia, Orpheus by Calliope, Linus of Thrace by Calliope or Urania and Hymenaios (Hymen) by one of the Muses.\\nIn the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesoid, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate.\\nCyrene was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, Aristaeus, and Idmon.\\nEvadne was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, Iamos. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth to assist her.\\nRhoeo, a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named Anius. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.\\nOurea, a daughter of Poseidon, fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king Laomedon. They both united on the day the walls of Troy were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion (Troy). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.\\nThero, daughter of Phylas, a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. By their union, she became mother of Chaeron, who was famed as \"the tamer of horses\". He later built the city Chaeronea.\\nHyrie or Thyrie was the mother of Cycnus. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.\\nHecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy, and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by Achilleus, and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo.\\nCoronis was daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. While pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his raven who informed him, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis\\' belly and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise.\\nDryope, the daughter of Dryops, was impregnated by Apollo in the form of a snake. She gave birth to a son named Amphissus.\\nIn Euripides\\' play \"Ion\", Apollo fathered Ion by Creusa, wife of Xuthus. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess.\\nApollo loved and kidnapped an Oceanid nymph, Melia. Her father Oceanus sent one of his sons, Caanthus, to find her, but Caanthus could not take her back from Apollo, so he burned Apollo\\'s sanctuary. In retaliation, Apollo shot and killed Caanthus.\\nMale lovers.\\nHyacinth (or Hyacinthus), a beautiful and athletic Spartan prince, was one of Apollo\\'s favourite lovers. The pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus\\' blood, Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning \"alas\". He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.\\nAnother male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.\\nAdmetus, the king of Pherae, was also Apollo\\'s lover. During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years, Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was \"fired with love\" for Admetus. Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo\\'s lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him. Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus. Tibullus describes Apollo\\'s love to the king as \"servitium amoris\" (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.\\nWhen Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis, Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis\\' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis\\' wrath and also convinced the Moirai to postpone Admetus\\' death once.\\nBranchus, a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god\\'s beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.\\nOther male lovers of Apollo include:\\nChildren.\\nApollo sired many children, from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.\\nAsclepius is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo\\'s. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo\\'s request, he was resurrected as a god. \\nAristaeus was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity. The Corybantes were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.\\nThe sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes Hector and Troilus, as well as Tenes, the king of Tenedos, all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.\\nApollo\\'s children who became musicians and bards include Orpheus, Linus, Ialemus, Hymenaeus, Philammon, Eumolpus and Eleuther. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, Apollonis, Borysthenis and Cephisso, who formed a group of minor Muses, the \"Musa Apollonides\". They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre. Phemonoe was a seer and a poetess who was the inventor of Hexameter.\\nApis, Idmon, Iamus, Tenerus, Mopsus, Galeus, Telmessus and others were gifted seers. Anius, Pythaeus and Ismenus lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.\\nArabus, Delphos, Dryops, Miletos, Tenes, Epidaurus, Ceos, Lycoras, Syrus, Pisus, Marathus, Megarus, Patarus, Acraepheus, Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.\\nHe also had a son named Chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist. His other daughters include Eurynome, Chariclo wife of Chiron, Eurydice the wife of Orpheus, Eriopis, famous for her beautiful hair, Melite the heroine, Pamphile the silk weaver, Parthenos, and by some accounts, Phoebe, Hilyra and Scylla. Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.\\nAdditionally, Apollo fostered and educated Chiron, the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo\\'s sons. Apollo also fostered Carnus, the son of Zeus and Europa.\\nFailed love attempts.\\nMarpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well. Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.\\nSinope, a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.\\nBolina was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph, saving her life.\\nCastalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the spring at Delphi, at the base of Mt. Parnassos, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.\\nCassandra, was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.\\nHestia, the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo\\'s and Poseidon\\'s marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.\\nFemale counterparts.\\nArtemis.\\nArtemis as the sister of Apollo, is \"thea apollousa\", that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual, which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period.\\nArtemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang. The laurel (\"daphne\") was sacred to both. \"Artemis Daphnaia\" had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi. \\n\"Apollo Daphnephoros\" had a temple in Eretria, a \"place where the citizens are to take the oaths\". In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios, Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon.\\nHecate.\\nHecate, the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers - Leto and Asteria - are sisters. One of Apollo\\'s epithets, \"Hecatos\", is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean \"working from afar\". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness. If Hecate is the \"gate-keeper\", Apollo \"Agyieus\" is the \"door-keeper\". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.\\nThe oldest evidence found for Hecate\\'s worship is at Apollo\\'s temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo\\'s sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis. Hecate\\'s lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo\\'s solar nature.\\nAthena.\\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena. Being Zeus\\' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of Athens, Apollo was the principle god of Sparta.\\nAs patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the Muses, the former a much more frequent companion than the latter. Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus.\\nIn the Trojan war, as Zeus\\' executive, Apollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does. Apollo\\'s decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.\\nApollo in the \"Oresteia\".\\nIn Aeschylus\\' \"Oresteia\" trilogy, Clytemnestra kills her husband, King Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon\\'s son, Orestes, is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes or Furies (female personifications of vengeance).\\nApollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo\\'s supplicant. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.\\nRoman Apollo.\\nThe Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. As a quintessentially Greek god, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus. There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.\\nOn the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo\\'s first temple at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the \"Apollinare\". During the Second Punic War in 212 BCE, the \"Ludi Apollinares\" (\"Apollonian Games\") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius. In the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.\\nAfter the battle of Actium, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo\\'s temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple to the god on the Palatine hill. Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the Secular Games, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.\\nFestivals.\\nThe chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games. Also of major importance was the Delia held every four years on Delos.\\nAthenian annual festivals included the Boedromia, Metageitnia, Pyanepsia, and Thargelia.\\nSpartan annual festivals were the Carneia and the Hyacinthia.\\nThebes every nine years held the Daphnephoria.\\nAttributes and symbols.\\nApollo\\'s most common attributes were the bow and arrow. Other attributes of his included the kithara (an advanced version of the common lyre), the plectrum and the sword. Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The Pythian Games were held in Apollo\\'s honor every four years at Delphi. The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games.\\nThe palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), ravens, hawks, crows (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers), snakes (referencing Apollo\\'s function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.\\nHomer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger. In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk. In addition, Claudius Aelianus wrote that in Ancient Egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called \"hawk-keepers\" (ἱερακοβοσκοί) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god. Eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city\\'s symbol is a man with a hawklike face (Horus). Claudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called Apollo Horus in their own language.\\nAs god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite cuneiform texts mention an Asia Minor god called \"Appaliunas\" or \"Apalunas\" in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo\\'s title of \"Lykegenes\" can simply be read as \"born in Lycia\", which effectively severs the god\\'s supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology).\\nIn literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase.\\nApollo is often associated with the Golden Mean. This is the Greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony.\\nIn antiquity, Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury. The ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before. The morning planet was called Apollo, and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they were the same, thereupon the name \\'Mercury/Hermes\\' was kept, and \\'Apollo\\' was dropped.\\nApollo in the arts.\\nApollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance. The earliest Greek word for a statue is \"delight\" (, \"agalma\"), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.\\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.\\nArchaic sculpture.\\nNumerous free-standing statues of male youths from Archaic Greece exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals. In 1895, V. I. Leonardos proposed the term \"kouros\" (\"male youth\") to refer to those from Keratea; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format.\\nThe earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of \"Apollo Ptoios\", Boeotia alone. Significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues. One of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as \"a miracle\" by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze, \"Piraeus Apollo\". It was found in Piraeus, a port city close to Athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern Peloponnesus. It is the only surviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue.\\nClassical sculpture.\\nThe famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara, a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm. While none of the Greek originals have survived, several Roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist.\\nOther notable forms are the Apollo Citharoedus and the Apollo Barberini.\\nHellenistic Greece-Rome.\\nApollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types). The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans, from the Renaissance through the 19th century. The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, made between 350 and 325 BCE.\\nThe life-size so-called \"Adonis\" found in 1780 on the site of a \"villa suburbana\" near the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem, Roman \"Thysdrus\", he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo, though now even a god\\'s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire.\\nAnother haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse. The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great. Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.\\nModern reception.\\nApollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry.\\nPostclassical art and literature.\\nDance and music.\\nApollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture. Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a \"Hymn of Apollo\" (1820), and the god\\'s instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky\\'s \"Apollon musagète\" (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs \"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom\"/\"Dionysus: Bringer of Love\".\\nBooks.\\nApollo been portrayed in modern literature, such as when Charles Handy, in \"Gods of Management\" (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture. Apollo represents a \\'role\\' culture where order, reason, and bureaucracy prevail. In 2016, author Rick Riordan published the first book in the Trials of Apollo series, publishing four other books in the series in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.\\nFilm.\\nApollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance, by Keith David in the 1997 animated feature film \"Hercules,\" by Luke Evans in the 2010 action film \"Clash of the Titans\", and by Dimitri Lekkos in the 2010 film \"\".\\nVideo games.\\nApollo has appeared in many modern video games. Apollo appears as a minor character in Santa Monica Studio\\'s 2010 action-adventure game \"God of War III\" with his bow being used by Peirithous. He also appears in the 2014 Hi-Rez Studios Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game \"Smite\" as a playable character.\\nPsychology and philosophy.\\nIn philosophical discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. Psychologist Carl Jung\\'s Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.\\nSpaceflight.\\nIn spaceflight, the 1960s and 1970s NASA program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the Moon was named after Apollo, by NASA manager Abe Silverstein:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"595\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=595\" title=\"Andre Agassi\">\\nAndre Agassi\\n\\nAndre Kirk Agassi ( ; born April 29, 1970) is an American former world No. 1 tennis player. He is an eight-time major champion and an Olympic gold medalist, as well as a runner-up in seven other majors.\\nAgassi is the second of five men to achieve the career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the fifth of eight overall to make the achievement. He is also the first of two men to achieve the career Golden Slam (career Grand Slam and Olympic gold medal), as well as the only man to win a career Super Slam (career Grand Slam, plus the Olympic gold medal and the year-end championships).\\nAgassi was the first man to win all four singles majors on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and remains the most recent American man to win the French Open (in 1999) and the Australian Open (in 2003). He also won 17 Masters titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990, 1992 and 1995. Agassi reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995, but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to No. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over. Agassi returned to No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years. During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname \"The Punisher\".\\nAfter suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open. He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60\\xa0million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada. In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K–12 public charter school for at-risk children. He has been married to fellow tennis player Steffi Graf since 2001.\\nEarly life.\\nAndre Agassi was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Emmanuel \"Mike\" Agassi (Aghassian), a former Olympic boxer from Iran and American Elizabeth \"Betty\" Agassi (née Dudley). His father is of Armenian and Assyrian heritage. Andre Agassi\\'s mother, Betty, is a breast cancer survivor. He has three older siblings – Rita (last wife of former number one Pancho Gonzales), Philip and Tami. Andre was given the middle name Kirk after Kirk Kerkorian, an Armenian American billionaire. Emmanuel Agassi, then a waiter at Tropicana Las Vegas, had met Kerkorian in 1963.\\nAt the age of 12, Agassi and his good friend and doubles partner, Roddy Parks, won the 1982 National Indoor Boys 14s Doubles Championship in Chicago. Agassi describes memorable experiences and juvenile pranks with Roddy in his book \"Open\".\\nWhen he was 13, Agassi was sent to Nick Bollettieri\\'s Tennis Academy in Florida. He was meant to stay for only three months, because that was all his father could afford. After thirty minutes of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri, deeply impressed by his talent, called Mike and said: \"Take your check back. He\\'s here for free.\" Agassi then dropped out of school in the ninth grade to pursue a full-time tennis career.\\nProfessional career.\\n1986–1993: Breakthrough and the first major title.\\nAgassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at La Quinta, California. He won his first match against John Austin, but then lost his second match to Mats Wilander. By the end of 1986, Agassi was ranked No. 91. He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the Sul American Open in Itaparica and ended the year ranked No. 25. He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, U.S. Men\\'s Clay Court Championships, Forest Hills WCT, Stuttgart Outdoor, Volvo International and Livingston Open), and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1\\xa0million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level. During 1988, he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager (a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005). His year-end ranking was No. 3, behind second-ranked Ivan Lendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander. Both the Association of Tennis Professionals and \"Tennis\" magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.\\nIn addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event\\'s traditionalism, particularly its \"predominantly white\" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.\\nStrong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semi-finals in 1989. He began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semi-finals. His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets. The Agassi-Sampras rivalry became the biggest one in tennis over the rest of the decade. Agassi ended 1990 on a high note as he helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.\\nIn 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier. Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to David Wheaton.\\nAgassi\\'s Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final. Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: Boris Becker and John McEnroe. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until Lleyton Hewitt ten years later. Agassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States\\' Davis Cup winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years. Agassi famously played the game wearing Oakley brand sunglasses, and a photo of him from the day appeared on the cover of \"Tennis\" magazine. In his memoir, he wrote that he was covering up bloodshot eyes from a hangover and claimed that the founder of Oakley, Jim Jannard, had sent him a Dodge Viper to thank him for the inadvertent publicity.\\nIn 1993, Agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the Cincinnati Masters, partnered with Petr Korda. He missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and No. 1 Pete Sampras in five sets. Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.\\n1994–1997: Rise to the top, Olympic Gold and the fall.\\nWith new coach Brad Gilbert on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the Canadian Open. His comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open with a five-set fourth-round victory against Michael Chang. He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an unseeded player, beating Michael Stich in the final. Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.\\nIn 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old \"image is everything\" style. He competed in the 1995 Australian Open (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating defending champion Sampras in a four-set final. Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on hardcourt, with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 (Cincinnati, Key Biscayne, and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total. He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late-night four-set semi-final of the US Open against Boris Becker. The streak ended the next day when Agassi lost the final to Sampras. Agassi admitted this loss, which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their head-to-head meetings, took two years for him to get over it mentally.\\nAgassi reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. Agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked No. 1 at the year-end ranking. In terms of win–loss record, 1995 was Agassi\\'s best year. He won 73 and lost 9 matches, and was also once again a key player on the United States\\' Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of his career.\\n1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early-round losses to Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi-finals. At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final. The high point for Agassi was winning the men\\'s singles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final. Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.\\n1997 was the low point of Agassi\\'s career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend. He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink. The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning. In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie. He quit the drug soon after. At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress, model, and socialite Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game. He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to No. 141 on November 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport\\'s premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships.\\n1998–2003: Return to glory and Career Super Slam.\\nIn 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world\\'s top 50. After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter.\\nIn 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from No. 110 to No. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year. At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to Tommy Haas. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne, losing to Marcelo Ríos, who became No. 1 as a result. At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).\\nAgassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career. Only Laver, Agassi, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have achieved this feat during the Open Era. This win also made him the first (of only four, the next being Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts). Agassi also became the only male player to win the Career Super Slam, consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year-end championship.\\nAgassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets. He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open, beating Todd Martin in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final. Overall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the ATP Masters Series in Paris, where he beat Marat Safin. Agassi ended 1999 as the No. 1, ending Sampras\\'s record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–98). This was the only time Agassi ended the year at No. 1. Agassi was runner-up to Sampras at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup losing 1–6, 5–7, 4–6 despite beating Sampras in the round-robin 6–2, 6–2.\\nHe began the next year 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semi-final and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final. He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969. At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.. 2000 also saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon. At the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat Safin in the semi-finals to end the Russian\\'s hopes to become the youngest No. 1 in the history of tennis. Agassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end No. 1.\\nAgassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément. En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie\\'s last Australian Open. At Wimbledon, they met again in the semi-finals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set. In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3-hour, 33\\xa0minute epic match with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7, with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match. Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked No. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades.\\n2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion. Agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key Biscayne title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final. At the US Open, Agassi overcame No.1 ranked and defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals. This led to what turned out to be the last duel between Agassi and Sampras in final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings. The match was the last of Sampras\\'s career. Agassi\\'s US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, Rome and Madrid, helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.\\nIn 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final.\\nOn April 28, 2003, he recaptured the No. 1 ranking to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. The record was later surpassed by Roger Federer in 2018. He had held the No. 1 ranking for two weeks, when Lleyton Hewitt took it back on May 12, 2003. Agassi then recaptured the No. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003. There he managed to reach the US Open semi-finals, where he lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero, surrendering his No. 1 ranking to him. During his career, Agassi held the ranking for a total of 101 weeks. Agassi\\'s ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from a number of events. At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer, his third time to finish as runner-up in the event after losses in 1999 and 2000, and finished the year ranked No. 4. At age 33, he had been one of the oldest players to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was No. 4 in 1987.\\n2004–2006: Final years.\\nIn 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semi-finals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin; the loss ended Agassi\\'s 26-match winning streak at the event. He won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), tied with Roger Federer and surpassed only by Ken Rosewall, who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked No. 8, one of the oldest players to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was No. 7 in 1988. At the time, Agassi also became the sixth male player during the open era to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles.\\nAgassi\\'s 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the Rogers Cup, before falling to No. 2 Rafael Nadal.\\nAgassi\\'s 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake, where he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker. His other five-set victories were on Xavier Malisse in the fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semi-finals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets. Agassi finished 2005 ranked No. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year\\'s end.\\nAgassi had a poor start to 2006, as he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time. Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then Wimbledon. He was defeated in the third round by world No. 2 (and eventual runner-up) Rafael Nadal. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match. At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open. Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open.\\nAgassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel, Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the second round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semi-finals. Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets. Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.\\nRivalries.\\nAgassi vs. Sampras.\\nThe rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 1990s, as Sampras and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade. They also had very contrasting playing styles, with Sampras being considered the greatest server and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time. Agassi and Sampras met 34 times on the tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20.\\nThe 1990 US Open was their first meeting in a Grand Slam tournament final. Agassi was favored as he was ranked No. 4 at the time, compared to the No. 12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had defeated Sampras in their only previously completed match. Agassi, however, lost the final to Sampras in straight sets. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the 1992 French Open, where they met in the quarterfinals. Although Sampras was ranked higher, Agassi came out winning in straight sets. They met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No. 1. Agassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole, levelling the match at two sets apiece; however, Sampras prevailed in five sets, and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship.\\nWith both Sampras and Agassi participating, the US won the Davis Cup in 1995. The year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles, meeting each other twice in the finals, and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year. They met five times during the year, all in the title matches, including the Australian Open, the Newsweek Champions Cup (now Indian Wells), the Lipton International Players Championships (now Miami Open), the Canadian Open, and the US Open. Agassi won three of the finals, including the Australian Open; however, Sampras took the US Open title, ending Agassi\\'s 26-match winning streak. After Agassi had taken most of the fall season off, Sampras took over the No. 1 ranking for the end of the season. Agassi admitted this loss, which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their head-to-head meetings, took two years for him to get over it mentally.\\nIn the following three years, while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles every season, Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions. The next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in 1999, where Sampras won in straight sets. For both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open. Sampras forfeited the No. 1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that year\\'s US Open, which Agassi went on to win. They faced each other twice in the season-ending ATP Tour World Championships, with Sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.\\nIn the 2000s, they met three more times on the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests. In 2000, the top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the Australian Open in five sets, which was an important win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against Sampras. In arguably their most memorable match ever, Sampras defeated Agassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals in four sets. There were no breaks of serve during the entire match. Reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during US Open rain delays, and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players.\\nTheir last meeting was the final of the 2002 US Open, which was their third meeting in a US Open final, but the first since 1995. The match was also notable because they had defeated several up-and-coming players en route to the final. Sampras had defeated No. 3 Tommy Haas in the fourth round and future No. 1 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, while Agassi had defeated No. 1 and defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals. Sampras defeated Agassi in four sets. This was the final ATP tour singles match of Sampras\\'s career.\\nAgassi vs. Chang.\\nMichael Chang was the opponent Agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than Sampras. They met 22 times on the tour level with Agassi leading 15–7. Chang, unlike most of Agassi\\'s big rivals, had a playing style similar to his. Both players preferred to stay at the baseline with Chang being more defensive-minded. The outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies. The rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of American tennis players and both being of foreign descent.\\nAgassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 US Open and defeating Chang, the defending champion, in the 1990 French Open in a four-set quarterfinal. Arguably their best match took place in the round of 16 of the 1994 US Open. While both players presented high-quality shot-making, the momentum changed from set to set with Agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory. It turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first US Open title. Their next two Grand Slam meetings came in 1996, with Chang recording easy straight-set victories in the semi-finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open. Years after, Agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker, who was awaiting the winner in the final. Agassi won the last four of their matches, with the last being in 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly past his prime.\\nAgassi vs. Becker.\\nBoris Becker and Agassi played 14 times with Agassi leading 10–4. Becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990, and won 10 of their last 11 matches. They first played at Indian Wells in 1988, with Becker prevailing. Their most notable match was the 1989 Davis Cup semi-final match, which Becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks. Agassi, considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass, shocked Becker, a three-time champion, in a five-set quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first Grand Slam title. The intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995. Becker won that year\\'s Wimbledon semi-final after being down a set and two breaks, to eventually win in four sets. In a highly anticipated rematch in the US Open semi-final, this time it was Agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets. Their final match was played at Hong Kong in 1999, which Agassi won in three sets.\\nAgassi vs. Rafter.\\nAgassi and Pat Rafter played fifteen times with Agassi leading 10–5. The rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters, because of the players\\' contrasting styles of play, with Rafter using traditional serve-&amp;-volley methods against Agassi\\'s variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons. Agassi led 8–2 on hard courts, but Rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the 1999 Rome Masters. They played four matches at Wimbledon with both winning two matches each. Agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999, while Rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters, the latter two matches being gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played. Agassi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open, in 1995 and 2001, on his way to the title on both occasions. Rafter, however, took their only US Open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title.\\nAgassi vs. Federer.\\nAgassi and Roger Federer played 11 times, and Federer led their head-to-head series 8–3. With the retirement of Sampras, the rivalry against the 11-years-younger Federer, who was another great server like Sampras, became Agassi\\'s main rivalry for the final years of his career. Agassi won their first three matches, but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones. They first met in just the third tournament of Federer\\'s career at the 1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer\\'s hometown, with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. Agassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Open in 2002. Federer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003, when he defeated Agassi in both the round-robin and the final. They played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two windy days, with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets. At the 2005 Dubai Championships, Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab. Their final duel took place in the final of the 2005 US Open. In the historic clash of generations, Federer was victorious in four sets in front of a pro-Agassi crowd. The match was the last appearance by Agassi in any tournament final.\\nAgassi vs. Lendl.\\nAgassi and Ivan Lendl played eight times, and Lendl led their head-to-head series 6–2.\\nAgassi vs. Edberg.\\nAgassi and Stefan Edberg played nine times, and Agassi led their head-to-head series 6–3.\\nEarnings.\\nAgassi earned more than $30\\xa0million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, Sampras and Murray to date (May 2018). He also earned more than $25\\xa0million a year through endorsements during his career, which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time.\\nPost-retirement.\\nSince retiring after the 2006 US Open, Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. On September 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open quarterfinal. He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters. He played World Team Tennis for the Philadelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009. At the 2009 French Open, Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer, who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.\\nAlso in 2009, Agassi played at the Outback Champions Series event for the first time. He played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships at Surprise, Arizona, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin. Agassi returned to the tour renamed for the PowerShares Series in 2011 and participated in a total of seven events while winning two. Agassi beat Courier in the final of the Staples Champions Cup in Boston and later defeated Sampras at the CTCA Championships at his hometown Las Vegas.\\nIn 2012, Agassi took part in five tournaments, winning three of those. In November, at first he won BILT Champions Showdown in San Jose, beating John McEnroe in the final. The following day, he defended his title of the CTCA Championships, while defeating Courier in the decisive match. In the series season finale, he beat Michael Chang for the Acura Champions Cup. The series and Agassi came back to action in 2014. Agassi won both tournaments he participated in. At the Camden Wealth Advisors Cup\\'s final in Houston, Agassi beat James Blake for a rematch of their 2005 US Open quarterfinal. He defeated Blake again in Portland to win the title of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championships. In 2015, Agassi took part in just one event of the PowerShares Series, losing to Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Champions Shootout. The following year he took part in two events, at first losing to Blake in Chicago, and the next day defeating Mardy Fish, but losing to Roddick in Charleston.\\nIn 2009, in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final. Sampras won the exhibition in three sets. The rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in the \"Hit for Haiti\" charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake. Partnered with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the old rivals began making jokes at each other\\'s expense, which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassi\\'s body. After the event, Agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras. Agassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets. On March 3, 2014, Agassi and Sampras squared off for an exhibition in London for the annual World Tennis Day. This time, it was Agassi who came out on top in two straight sets.\\nHe returned to the tour in May 2017 in the position of coach to Novak Djokovic for the French Open. Agassi announced the end of the partnership on March 31, 2018, stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship.\\nPlaying style.\\nEarly in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but especially down the line. His forehand was nearly as strong, especially his inside-out to the ad court.\\nAgassi\\'s strength was in dictating play from the baseline, and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise. While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way. When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi\\'s two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot. A signature play later in his career was a change-up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.\\nAgassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time. His strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.\\nBusiness ventures.\\nAgassi established a limited liability company named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises). Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, Shaquille O\\'Neal, Ken Griffey Jr., and Monica Seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996. The restaurant closed down in 2001.\\nIn 1999, he paid $1\\xa0million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank and made a $10\\xa0million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006.\\nIn 2002, he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers and cable and satellite industry, and made an equity investment in the network. After meeting chef Michael Mina at one of his restaurants in San Francisco, Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina Group Inc. and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco, San Jose, Dana Point, Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Agassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Golden Nugget Laughlin from MGM Mirage for $215\\xa0million in 2004. One year later, the group sold the hotel-casino to Landry\\'s, Inc. for $163\\xa0million in cash and $182\\xa0million in assumed debt. In 2007, he sat on the board of Meadows Bank, an independent bank in Nevada. He has invested in start-up companies backed by Allen &amp; Company.\\nAgassi and Graf formed a company called Agassi Graf Holdings. They invested in PURE, a nightclub at Caesars Palace, which opened in 2004, and sold it to Angel Management Group in 2010. In August 2006, Agassi and Graf developed a joint venture with high-end furniture maker Kreiss Enterprises. They launched a furniture line called Agassi Graf Collection. In September, Agassi and Graf, through their company Agassi Graf Development LLC, along with Bayview Financial LP, finalized an agreement to develop a condominium hotel, Fairmont Tamarack, at Tamarack Resort in Donnelly, Idaho. Owing to difficult market conditions and delays, they withdrew from the project in 2009. The group still owns three small chunks of land. In September, they collaborated with Steve Case\\'s Exclusive Resorts to co-develop luxury resorts and design Agassi-Graf Tennis and Fitness Centers.\\nThey also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and both serve as board members and advisors of the company.\\nIn October 2012, Village Roadshow and investors including Agassi and Graf announced plans to build a new water park called Wet\\'n\\'Wild Las Vegas in Las Vegas. Village Roadshow has a 51% stake in the park while Agassi, Graf, and other private investors hold the remaining 49%. The park opened in May 2013.\\nIMG managed Agassi from the time he turned pro in 1986 through January 2000 before switching to SFX Sports Group. His business manager, lawyer and agent was childhood friend Perry Rogers, but they have been estranged since 2008. In 2009, he and Graf signed with CAA.\\nEquipment and endorsements.\\nAgassi used Prince Graphite rackets early in his career. He signed a $7\\xa0million endorsement contract with Belgian tennis racquet makers Donnay. He later switched to Head Ti Radical racket and Head\\'s LiquidMetal Radical racket, having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Head in 1993. He renewed his contract in 1999, and in November 2003 he signed a lifetime agreement with Head. He also endorses Penn tennis balls. On July 25, 2005, Agassi left Nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas. A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi\\'s charities, and Adidas was more than happy to do so. On May 13, 2013, Agassi rejoined Nike.\\nAgassi was sponsored by DuPont, Ebel, Mountain Dew in 1993, Mazda in 1997, Kia Motors in 2002, American Express and Deutsche Bank in 2003. In 1990, he appeared in a television commercial for Canon Inc., promoting the Canon EOS Rebel camera. Between 1999 and 2000, he signed a multimillion-dollar, multiyear endorsement deal with Schick and became the worldwide spokesman for the company. Agassi signed a multiyear contract with Twinlab and promoted the company\\'s nutritional supplements. In mid-2003, he was named the spokesman of Aramis Life, a fragrance by Aramis, and signed a five-year deal with the company. In March 2004, he signed a ten-year agreement worth $1.5\\xa0million a year with 24 Hour Fitness, which will open five Andre Agassi fitness centers by year-end. Prior to the 2012 Australian Open, Agassi and Australian winemaker Jacobs Creek announced a three-year partnership and created the Open Film Series to \"[share] personal stories about the life defining moments that shaped his character on and off the court.\" In 2007, watchmaker Longines named Agassi as their brand ambassador.\\nAgassi and his mother appeared in a Got Milk? advertisement in 2002.\\nAgassi has appeared in many advertisements and television commercials with Graf. They both endorsed Deutsche Telekom in 2002, Genworth Financial and Canon Inc. in 2004, LVMH in 2007, and Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit U and Longines in 2013.\\nPersonal life.\\nRelationships and family.\\nIn the early 1990s, after dating Wendi Stewart, Agassi dated American singer and entertainer Barbra Streisand. He wrote about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, \"We agree that we\\'re good for each other, and so what if she\\'s twenty-eight years older? We\\'re sympatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection. It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo – another piece of my overall rebellion. Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava.\"\\nHe was married to Brooke Shields from 1997 to 1999.\\nHe married Steffi Graf on October 22, 2001, at their Las Vegas home; the only witnesses were their mothers. They have two children: son Jaden Gil (born 2001) and daughter Jaz Elle (born 2003). Agassi has said that he and Graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players. The Graf-Agassi family resides in Summerlin, a community in the Las Vegas Valley. Graf\\'s mother and brother, Michael, with his four children, also live there.\\nLong-time trainer Gil Reyes has been called one of Agassi\\'s closest friends; some have described him as being a \"father figure\" to Agassi. In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes. In December 2008, Agassi\\'s childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.\\nAutobiography.\\nAgassi\\'s autobiography, \"\", (written with assistance from J. R. Moehringer), was published in November 2009. In it, Agassi talks about his childhood and his unconventional Armenian father, who came to the United States from Iran, where he was a professional boxer. Overly demanding and emotionally abusive to the whole family, his father groomed young Agassi for tennis greatness by building a tennis court in their backyard and sending Agassi to tennis boarding school under the supervision of Nick Bollettieri, who later coached and managed part of Agassi\\'s professional career.\\nThere is also mention in the book of using and testing positive for methamphetamine in 1997. In response to this revelation, Roger Federer declared himself shocked and disappointed, while Marat Safin argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles. In an interview with CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that \"It was a period in my life where I needed help.\"\\nAgassi said that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him. He also said he wore a hairpiece earlier in his career and thought Pete Sampras was \"robotic\".\\nThe book reached No. 1 on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list and received favorable reviews. It won the Autobiography category of the 2010 British Sports Book Awards. In 2018, the book was listed on \"Esquire\" as one of \"The 30 Best Sports Books Ever Written\", and was also recommended by self-help author Tim Ferriss who described it as \"very candid, very amusing, and very instructional\".\\nIn media.\\nIn 2017, Agassi appeared in the documentary film \"Love Means Zero\", which highlighted the troubled relationship between his coach Nick Bollettieri and him.\\nPolitics.\\nAgassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates, and $2,000 to Republicans. On September 1, 2010, when he appeared on daily WNYC public radio program \"The Brian Lehrer Show\", he stated that he is registered as Independent.\\nPhilanthropy.\\nAgassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas\\' young people. He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He has been cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.\\nAgassi\\'s charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys &amp; Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.\\nIn 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. He personally donated $35\\xa0million to the school. In 2009, the graduating class had a 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate. Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County\\'s only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven. In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education. His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children. This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.\\nIn 2007, along with several other athletes, Agassi founded the charity Athletes for Hope, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities. He created the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund, now known as the Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund. The Fund is an investment initiative for social change, focusing on the \"nationwide effort to move charters from stopgap buildings into permanent campuses.\"\\nIn September 2013, the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education formed a partnership with V20 Foods to launch Box Budd!es, a line of kids\\' healthy snacks. All proceeds go to the Foundation.\\nIn February 2014, Agassi remodeled the vacant University of Phoenix building in Las Vegas as a new school, called the Doral Academy West through the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund. Doral Academy opened in August 2014. The Fund purchased a 4.6-acre plot in Henderson, Nevada to house the Somerset Academy of Las Vegas, which will relocate from its campus inside a church.\\nCareer statistics.\\nGrand Slam finals (8 titles, 7 runners-up).\\nBy winning the 1999 French Open, Agassi completed a men\\'s singles Career Grand Slam. He is the 5th of 8 male players in history (after Budge, Perry, Laver and Emerson, and before Federer, Nadal and Djokovic) to achieve this.\\nLegacy.\\nConsidered by numerous sources to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Agassi has also been called one of the greatest service returners ever to play the game, and was described by the BBC upon his retirement as \"perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport\\'s history\". As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"596\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596\" title=\"Artificial languages\">\\nArtificial languages\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"597\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597\" title=\"Austroasiatic languages\">\\nAustroasiatic languages\\n\\nThe Austroasiatic languages , , are a large language family in Mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. These languages are scattered throughout parts of Thailand, Laos, India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and southern China and are the majority languages of Vietnam and Cambodia. There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages. Of these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer, and Mon have a long-established recorded history. Only two have official status as modern national languages: Vietnamese in Vietnam and Khmer in Cambodia. The Mon language is a recognized indigenous language in Myanmar and Thailand. In Myanmar, the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State. Santali is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.\\n\"Ethnologue\" identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps Shompen, which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer, and Munda. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Mon-Khmer, and Khasi–Khmuic), while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.\\nAustroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and East Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the extant original languages of Mainland Southeast Asia (excluding the Andaman Islands), with the neighboring, and sometimes surrounding, Kra–Dai, Hmong-Mien, Austronesian, and Sino-Tibetan languages being the result of later migrations.\\nEtymology.\\nThe name \"Austroasiatic\" comes from a combination of the Latin words for \"South\" and \"Asian\", hence \"South Asian\".\\nTypology.\\nRegarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic \"sesquisyllabic\" pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed, full syllable. This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants. As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have infixes, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.\\nThe Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast, either between modal (normal) voice and breathy (lax) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice. Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.\\nHowever, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, tonogenesis. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.\\nProto-language.\\nMuch work has been done on the reconstruction of Proto-Mon–Khmer in Harry L. Shorto\\'s \"Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary\". Little work has been done on the Munda languages, which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic. Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:\\nThis is identical to earlier reconstructions except for . is better preserved in the Katuic languages, which Sidwell has specialized in.\\nInternal classification.\\nLinguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, Northeast India and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh, parts of Nepal. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.\\nEach of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade. By contrast, the relationships \"between\" these families within Austroasiatic are debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accepts traditional \"Mon–Khmer\" as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.\\nIn addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra (Diffloth), the Chamic languages of Vietnam, and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).\\nDiffloth (1974).\\nDiffloth\\'s widely cited original classification, now abandoned by Diffloth himself, is used in \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in \"Ethnologue.\"\\nPeiros (2004).\\nPeiros is a lexicostatistic classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact. Indeed, when Sidwell (2009) replicated Peiros\\'s study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.\\nDiffloth (2005).\\nDiffloth compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the evidence has not been published. As a schematic, we have:\\nOr in more detail,\\nSidwell (2009–2015).\\nPaul Sidwell (2009), in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.\\nHe therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.\\nIf this would the case, Sidwell &amp; Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell &amp; Blench (2011) suggest Shompen as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong river valley relatively quickly.\\nSubsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179) proposed that Nicobarese subgroups with Aslian, just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other.\\nA subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis (Sidwell 2015b) suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure, with an east–west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present. However, he still considers the subbranching dubious.\\nIntegrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015c) further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into Indochina from the Lingnan area of southern China, with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.\\nSidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the Neolithic transition era of mainland Southeast Asia, with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the Pearl River watershed of Lingnan, which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the Mekong River via Yunnan. Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and millet, kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.\\nAt 4,500 B.P., this \"Neolithic package\" suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P. However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.\\nDuring the Iron Age about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as Vietic, Katuic, Pearic, and Khmer were formed, while the more internally diverse Bahnaric branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification. By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.\\nPaul Sidwell (2018) considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructible in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.\\nRoger Blench (2017) suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques) can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for \\'river, valley\\', \\'boat\\', \\'fish\\', \\'catfish sp.\\', \\'eel\\', \\'prawn\\', \\'shrimp\\' (Central Austroasiatic), \\'crab\\', \\'tortoise\\', \\'turtle\\', \\'otter\\', \\'crocodile\\', \\'heron, fishing bird\\', and \\'fish trap\\'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern Indochina (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years ago (2,000 BC), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.\\nSidwell (2022) proposes that the locus of Proto-Austroasiatic was in the Red River Delta area about 4,000-4,500 years before present, instead of the Middle Mekong as he had previously proposed. Austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys. Khmuic, Palaungic, and Khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the Red Valley valley. Based on their current distributions, about half of all Austroasiatic branches (including Nicobaric and Munda) can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals.\\nHence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to Sino-Tibetan, whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.\\nSidwell (2018).\\nSidwell (2018) (quoted in Sidwell 2021) gives a more nested classification of Austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of Austroasiatic languages using a 200-word list. Many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages. Pakanic and Shompen were not included.\\nPossible extinct branches.\\nRoger Blench (2009) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages.\\nOther languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:\\nJohn Peterson (2017) suggests that \"pre-Munda\" (\"proto-\" in regular terminology) languages may have once dominated the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east. Peterson notes that eastern Indo-Aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while western Indo-Aryan languages do not.\\nWriting systems.\\nOther than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the Khmer, Thai, Lao, and Burmese alphabets. Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing. This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century. The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.\\nExternal relations.\\nAustric languages.\\nAustroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial Austric hypothesis, which also includes the Austronesian languages, and in some proposals also the Kra–Dai languages and the Hmong–Mien languages.\\nHmong-Mien.\\nSeveral lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatic language families (Ratliff 2010), some of which had earlier been proposed by Haudricourt (1951). This could imply a relation or early language contact along the Yangtze.\\nAccording to Cai (et al. 2011), Hmong–Mien is at least partially related to Austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by Sino-Tibetan, especially Tibeto-Burman languages.\\nIndo-Aryan languages.\\nIt is suggested that the Austroasiatic languages have some influence on Indo-Aryan languages including Sanskrit and middle Indo-Aryan languages. Indian linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali were borrowed from Munda languages. Additionally, French linguist Jean Przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the Austroasiatic realm and the Indian mythological stories of Matsyagandha (from \"Mahabharata\") and the Nāgas.\\nAustroasiatic migrations and archaeogenetics.\\n suggests that Haplogroup O1b1, which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern China, and haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today\\'s Japanese, Koreans and, are the carriers of early rice-agriculturalists from Indochina. Another study suggests that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and O1b2 the \"para-Austroasiatic\" lineage of the, Korean and Yayoi people.\\nA 2021 study by Tagore et al. found that the proto-Austroasiatic speakers split from an Basal East Asian source population, native to Mainland Southeast Asia and Northeast India, which also gave rise to other East Asian-related populations, including Northeast Asians and Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The proto-Austroasiatic speakers can be linked to the Hoabinhian material culture. From Mainland Southeast Asia, the Austroasiatic speakers expanded into the Indian-subcontinent and Maritime Southeast Asia. There is evidence that later back migration from more northerly East Asian groups (such as Kra-Dai speakers) merged with indigenous Southeast Asians, contributing to the fragmentation observed among modern day Austroasiatic-speakers. In the Indian subcontinent, Austroasiatic speakers, specifically Mundari, intermixed with the local population. Furthermore they concluded that their results do not support a genetic relationship between Ancient Southeast Asian hunter-gatherers (Hoabinhians) with Papuan-related groups, as previously suggested by McColl et al. 2018, but that these Ancient Southeast Asians are characterized by Basal East Asian ancestry. The authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with linguistic identity, pointing to the fragmentation of modern Austroasiatic speakers.\\nLarena et al. 2021 could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of Basal East Asians in Mainland Southeast Asia, which are estimated to have formed about 50kya years ago, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards. Early Austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage, which split from Ancestral East Asians between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago, and were among the first wave to replace distinct Australasian-related groups in Insular Southeast Asia. East Asian-related ancestry became dominant in Insular Southeast Asia already between 15,000 years to 12,000 years ago, and may be associated with Austroasiatic groups, which however got again replaced by later Austronesian groups some 10,000 to 7,000 years ago. Early Austroasiatic people were found to be best represented by the Mlabri people in modern day Thailand. Proposals for Austroasiatic substratum among later Austronesian languages in Western Indonesia, noteworthy among the Dayak languages, is strengthened by genetic data, suggesting Austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by Austronesian speakers.\\nA study in November 2021 (Guo et al.) found that modern East-Eurasians can be modeled from four ancestry components, which descended from a common ancestor in Mainland Southeast Asia, one being the \"Ancestral Austroasiatic\" component (AAA), which is more prevalent among modern Southeast Asians, and making up the exclusive ancestry among Austroasiatic-speaking Lua and Mlabri people. The early Austroasiatic speakers are suggested to have been hunter-gatherers but became rice-agriculturalists quite early, spreading from Mainland Southeast Asia northwards to the Yangtze river, westwards into the Indian subcontinent, and southwards into Insular Southeast Asia. Evidence for these migrations are Austroasiatic loanwords related to rice-agriculture found among non-Austroasiatic languages, and the presence of Austroasiatic genetic ancestry.\\nAccording to a recent genetic study, Sundanese, Javanese, and Balinese, has almost an equal ratio of genetic marker shared between Austronesian and Austroasiatic heritages.\\nMigration into India.\\nAccording to Chaubey et al., \"Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from Southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.\" According to Riccio et al., the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.\\nAccording to Zhang et al., Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago. Arunkumar et al., suggest Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia occurred into Northeast India 5.2\\u2009±\\u20090.6 kya and into East India 4.3\\u2009±\\u20090.2 kya.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"598\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=598\" title=\"Afro-asiatic languages\">\\nAfro-asiatic languages\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"599\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599\" title=\"Afroasiatic languages\">\\nAfroasiatic languages\\n\\nThe Afroasiatic languages (or Afro-Asiatic), also known as Hamito-Semitic, or Semito-Hamitic, and sometimes also as Afrasian, Erythraean or Lisramic, are a language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in the geographic subregions of Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahara/Sahel. With the exception of its Semitic branch, all branches of the Afroasiatic family are exclusively native to the African continent.\\nAfroasiatic languages have over 500 million native speakers, which is the fourth-largest number of native speakers of any language family (after Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Niger–Congo). The phylum has six branches: Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Egyptian, Semitic, and Omotic. The most widely spoken modern Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum by far is Arabic, a \"de facto\" group of distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch. The languages that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native speakers, concentrated primarily in the Middle East and North Africa.\\nIn addition to the languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes many ancient languages, such as Egyptian, which forms a distinct branch of the family; and within the Semitic family, Akkadian, Hebrew, Phoenician, other Canaanite languages, Amorite, Ugaritic and Aramaic. While there is no consensus among historical linguists concerning the original homeland of the Afroasiatic family or the period when the parent language (i.e. Proto-Afroasiatic) was spoken, most agree that it was located within a region of Northeast Africa. Proposed specific locations include the Horn of Africa, Egypt, the eastern Sahara, and the Levant.\\nEtymology.\\nIn the early 19th century, linguists grouped the Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian languages within a \"Hamitic\" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages\\' genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic phylum. The terms \"Hamitic\" and \"Semitic\" were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham and Shem, two sons of Noah. By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.\\nFriedrich Müller introduced the name \"Hamito-Semitic\" for the entire language family in his \"Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft\" (1876). Maurice Delafosse (1914) later coined the term \"Afroasiatic\" (often now spelled \"Afro-Asiatic\"). However, it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that \\'Hamitic\\' was not a valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race. In current scholarly usage, the most commonly used names are \"Afroasiatic\", \"Hamito-Semitic\", and \"Semito-Hamitic\".\\nIndividual scholars have also called the family \"Erythraean\" (Tucker 1966) and \"Lisramic\" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of \"Hamito-Semitic\", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term \"Afrasian\", meaning \"half African, half Asiatic\", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family\\'s constituent languages.\\nDistribution and branches.\\nScholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including at least the following five branches:\\nA sixth family\\'s inclusion in Afroasiatic is disputed by a minority of scholars:\\nAlthough there is general agreement on these six families, linguists who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:\\nDemographics.\\nIn descending order of the number of speakers, widely-spoken Afroasiatic languages include:\\nClassification history.\\nIn the 9th century the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria became the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic. In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, Theodor Benfey proposed a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (he called the latter \"Ethiopic\"). In the same year T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.\\nFriedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his \"Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft\" (\"Outline of Linguistics\"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a \"Hamitic\" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. It was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius (1810–1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical gender system. This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient Egyptian language, the Berber languages, the Cushitic languages, the Beja language, and the Chadic languages. Unlike Müller, Lepsius saw Hausa and Nama as part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments for grouping particular languages together.\\nIn 1912, Carl Meinhof published \"Die Sprachen der Hamiten\" (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius\\'s model, adding the Fula, Maasai, Bari, Nandi, Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof\\'s model was widely supported in the 1940s. Meinhof\\'s system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the \\'Negroes of Africa\\'.\" However, in the case of the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of language mixture\". Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.\\nLeo Reinisch (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, Joseph Greenberg\\'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof\\'s linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category, in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half-century earlier\". He consequently rejoined Meinhof\\'s so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings. He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed a new name, \"Afroasiatic\", for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\\nGreenberg developed his model fully in his book \"The Languages of Africa\" (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof\\'s additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably Nilo-Saharan. Following Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the Khoekhoe language as a member of the Khoisan languages, a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe, though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages regard them as linguistic isolates. Despite this, Greenberg\\'s classification remains a starting point for modern work on many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.\\nSince the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive (monophyletic) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.\\nIn 1969, Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name \"Omotic\". This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.\\nBased on typological differences with the other Cushitic languages, Robert Hetzron proposed that Beja has to be removed from Cushitic, thus forming an independent branch of Afroasiatic. Most scholars, however, reject this proposal, and continue to group Beja as the sole member of a Northern branch within Cushitic.\\n\"Glottolog\" does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: South Omotic, Mao, Dizoid, Gonga–Gimojan (North Omotic apart from the preceding), Ongota, and Kujarge.\\nSubgrouping.\\nLittle agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.\\nOtherwise:\\nDate of Afroasiatic.\\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago). Symbols on Gerzean (Naqada II) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic, and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other proto-languages.\\nAfroasiatic Urheimat.\\nThe Afroasiatic \"urheimat\", the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before the original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages, is unknown. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the Sahara pump operating over the last 10,000 years.\\nThere is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of the language family existed, but some link the first speakers to the first farmers in the Levant who would later spread to North and East Africa. Others argue the first speakers were pre-agricultural and based in Northeast Africa.\\nShared features with Indo-European languages in West Asia related to food production are suggested by some scholars to support a Levantine origin for Afroasiatic languages. The Levantine hypothesis does not account for the domestication of plants endemic to the Horn of Africa such as teff, ensete, and niger seed or for the lack of evidence for intrusive agricultural populations or the cultivation of wheat, barley, or sorghum there prior to 3000 BC. A Northeast African origin is supported by the majority of scholars today. The region includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, which is sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. Igor M. Diakonoff placed the origin of the Afro-Asiatic languages in northeast Africa, with older strands south of Egypt, and newer elements straddling the Nile Delta and Sinai. Christopher Ehret argues that Proto-Afroasiatic speakers in Northeast Africa developed subsistence patterns of intensive plant collection and pastoralism, which gave the population an economic advantage that impelled the expansion of the Afroasiatic languages. Ehret suggests that a Proto-Semitic- or Proto-Semito-Berber-speaking population migrated from Northeast Africa to the Levant during the late Paleolithic and eventually gave rise to the Natufian culture. The linguist Roger Blench proposed southwestern Ethiopia as the most likely homeland of Afroasiatic, in part because of the high internal diversification of the Omotic branch spoken in that region.\\nVarious scholars have hypothesized on the origins of Afroasiatic based on genetic evidence. Y Haplogroup E-M215 is common among modern Afroasiatic-speaking groups and has been associated with an ancestral Afroasiatic population in Northeast Africa. In a 2014 autosomal DNA study, Hodgson et al. postulate that the Afroasiatic languages may have been spread by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly-identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\". The genetic component is prevalent among modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations and is found at its highest levels among those in the Horn of Africa. The researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably migrated from the Near East to Northeast Africa in the pre-agricultural period (~12–23 ka) and that a descendant population migrated back to the Levant prior to 4000 BC and developed the Semitic branch of Afroasiatic.\\nSimilarities in grammar and syntax.\\nFeatures observed in all known Afroasiatic language families include:\\nWidespread, though not universal, features of the Afroasiatic languages include:\\nOne of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at right), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n j/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /j-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.\\nAccording to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically.\\nThe Berber and Semitic branches share certain grammatical features (e.g. alternative feminine endings *-ay/*-āy; corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations) which can be reconstructed for a higher-order proto-language (provisionally called \"Proto-Berbero-Semitic\" by Kossmann &amp; Suchard (2018) and Van Putten (2018)). Whether this proto-language is ancestral to Berber and Semitic only, or also to other branches of Afroasiatic, still remains to be established.\\nShared vocabulary.\\nThe following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs.\\nThere are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova. The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything. The following table contains the thirty roots or so (out of thousands) that represent a fragile consensus of present research:\\nEtymological bibliography.\\nSome of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include:\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"600\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600\" title=\"Andorra\">\\nAndorra\\n\\nAndorra, officially the Principality of Andorra, is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278. It is headed by two co-princes: the bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain and the president of France. Its capital and largest city is Andorra la Vella.\\nAndorra is the sixth-smallest state in Europe, with an area of and a population of approximately . The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent. Andorra is the world\\'s 16th-smallest country by land and 11th-smallest by population. Its capital, Andorra la Vella, is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of above sea level. The official language is Catalan, but Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.\\nTourism in Andorra brings an estimated 10.2 million visitors to the country annually. Andorra is not a member state of the European Union. It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.\\nEtymology.\\nThe origin of the word Andorra is unknown, although several hypotheses have been proposed. The oldest is one put forward by the Greek historian Polybius (\"The Histories\" III, 35, 1), who describes the Andosins, an Iberian Pre-Roman tribe, as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars. The word Andosini or Andosins () may derive from the Basque \\', meaning \"big\" or \"giant\". The Andorran toponymy shows evidence of Basque language in the area. Another theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old word Anorra that contains the Basque word \\' (water).\\nAnother theory suggests that Andorra may derive from , meaning \"the thickly wooded place\". When the Arabs and Moors conquered the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the High Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest. These regions were not administered by Muslims, because of the geographic difficulty of direct rule.\\nOther theories suggest that the term derives from the Navarro-Aragonese \"andurrial\", which means \"land covered with bushes\" or \"scrubland\".\\nThe folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite valley of Endor or Andor (where the Midianites had been defeated), a name bestowed by his heir and son Louis the Pious after defeating the Moors in the \"wild valleys of Hell\".\\nHistory.\\nPrehistory.\\nLa Balma de la Margineda, found by archaeologists at Sant Julià de Lòria, was settled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from Ariege and Segre.\\nDuring the Neolithic Age, a group of people moved to the Valley of Madriu (the present-day Natural Park located in Escaldes-Engordany declared UNESCO World Heritage Site) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock, and developed a commercial trade with people from the Segre and Occitania.\\nOther archaeological deposits include the Tombs of Segudet (Ordino) and Feixa del Moro (Sant Julià de Lòria), both dated in 4900–4300 BCE as an example of the Urn culture in Andorra. The model of small settlements began to evolve to a complex urbanism during the Bronze Age. Metallurgical items of iron, ancient coins, and relicaries can be found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country.\\nThe sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes (Stone of the Witches) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in Andorra, located in the parish of Canillo, about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone murals.\\nIberian and Roman Andorra.\\nThe inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the Iberians and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini () during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. Influenced by the Aquitanian, Basque and Iberian languages, the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer Polybius in his \"Histories\" during the Punic Wars.\\nSome of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d\\'Enclar (part of the early Marca Hispanica), l\\'Anxiu in Les Escaldes and Roc de L\\'Oral in Encamp.\\nThe presence of Roman influence is recorded from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE. The places with the most Roman presence are in Camp Vermell (Red Field) in Sant Julià de Lòria, and in some places in Encamp, as well as in the Roc d\\'Enclar. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of Urgellet (the present-day La Seu d\\'Urgell) and all across Segre through the \"via romana\" Strata Ceretana (also known as Strata Confluetana).\\nVisigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne.\\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Andorra came under the influence of the Visigoths, the Kingdom of Toledo, and the Diocese of Urgell. The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time Christianity spread. When the Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the Iberian Peninsula, Andorra was sheltered from these Arab invaders by the Franks.\\nTradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of 5,000 soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the Moors near Porté-Puymorens (Cerdanya).\\nAndorra remained part of the Frankish \"Marca Hispanica\", the buffer zone between the Frankish Empire and the Muslim territories, Andorra being part of the territory ruled by the Count of Urgell and eventually the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell. Tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, writing the \"Carta de Poblament\" or a local municipal charter circa 805.\\nIn 988, Count Borrell II of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya. Since then, the bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d\\'Urgell, has been co-prince of Andorra.\\nThe first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the \"Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d\\'Urgell\" (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d\\'Urgell). The document, dated 839, depicts the six old parishes of the Andorran valleys that made up the country\\'s administrative division.\\nMedieval Age: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality.\\nBefore 1095, Andorra had no military protection, and the bishop of Urgell, who knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, asked the Lord of Caboet for help and protection. In 1095, the lord of Caboet and the bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò. Their daughter, Ermessenda, married the count of Foix, Roger-Bernard II. Roger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over Andorra with the bishop of Urgell.\\nIn the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the Cathar Crusade. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of Aragon, Peter III, between the bishop and the count, by the signing of the first paréage, which provided that Andorra\\'s sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia. This gave the principality its territory and political form.\\nA second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d\\'Enclar. The document was ratified by the noble notary Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà, and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.\\nIn 1364, the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes, making possible the creation of local departments (comuns, quarts and veïnats). After being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count John I, the Consell de la Terra or Consell General de les Valls (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d\\'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the Justice Courts (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the co-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally \"fire and site\", a national tax active since then).\\nAlthough there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d\\'Enclar or Església de Santa Coloma), Andorra developed exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th through 14th centuries, particularly in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child (Our Lady of Meritxell being the most important). Nowadays, the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra\\'s cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve, Sant Joan de Caselles, Església de Sant Miquel d\\'Engolasters, Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others.\\nThe Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the Catalan language at the end of the 11th century. Andorra was influenced by this language, which was adopted locally decades before it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon.\\nThe local economy during the Middle Ages was based on livestock, agriculture, furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first iron foundries began to appear in Northern Parishes like Ordino, much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.\\n16th to 18th centuries.\\nIn 1601 the Tribunal de Corts (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of Huguenot rebellions in France, Inquisition courts coming from Spain and witchcraft-related beliefs native to the area, in the context of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.\\nWith the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre. After Henry III of Navarre became king of France, he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra, a political arrangement that still holds.\\nDuring 1617, communal councils form the sometent (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme (brigandage) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today.\\nAndorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (fargues, a system similar to Farga Catalana) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade. In 1371 and 1448, the co-princes ratified the fair of Andorra la Vella, the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.\\nThe country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors, in Escaldes-Engordany. Founded in 1604, it took advantage of the local thermal waters. By this time, the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms (wealthy society) and casalers (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving from the tradition of pubilla and hereu.\\nThree centuries after its foundation, the Consell de la Terra located its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in Casa de la Vall in 1702. The manor house built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the Closet of the six keys (Armari de les sis claus), representative of each Andorran parish, where the Andorran constitution and other documents and laws were later kept.\\nIn both the Reapers\\' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, the Andorran people (while professing to be a neutral country) supported the Catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the \"Book of Privileges\" (\"Llibre de Privilegis de 1674\"), \"Manual Digest\" (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the \"Polità andorrà\" (1763) by Antoni Puig.\\n19th century: the New Reform and the Andorran Question.\\nAfter the French Revolution, Napoleon I reestablished the Co-Principate in 1809 and removed the French medieval title. In 1812–1813, the First French Empire annexed Catalonia during the Peninsular War () and divided the region into four départements, with Andorra as a part of the district of Puigcerdà. In 1814, an imperial decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.\\nDuring this period, Andorra\\'s late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged. In 1866, the syndic Guillem d\\'Areny-Plandolit led the reformist group in a Council General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families. The Council General replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.\\nThe New Reform () began after ratification by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the constitution and symbolssuch as the tricolour flagof Andorra. A new service economy arose as a demand of the valley inhabitants and began to build infrastructure such as hotels, spa resorts, roads and telegraph lines.\\nThe authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country. The ban resulted in an economic conflict and the Revolution of 1881, which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 December 1880, and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas. The Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies. From 7 to 9 June 1881, the loyalists of Canillo and Encamp reconquered the parishes of Ordino and La Massana by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in Escaldes-Engordany. After a day of combat the Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls was signed on 10 June. The council was replaced and new elections were held. The economic situation worsened, as the populace was divided over the \\xa0– the \"Andorran Question\" in relation to the Eastern Question. The struggles continued between pro-bishops, pro-French, and nationalists based on the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885.\\nAndorra participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan Renaixença. Between 1882 and 1887, the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language, Catalan. Romantic authors from France and Spain reported the awakening of the national consciousness of the country. Jacint Verdaguer lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer, Joaquim de Riba.\\nIn 1848, Fromental Halévy had premiered the opera \"Le Val d\\'Andorre\" to great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War.\\n20th and 21st century: Modernisation of the country and the Constitutional Andorra.\\nIn 1933 France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the Revolution of 1933 and the FHASA strikes (Vagues de FHASA); the revolt led by Joves Andorrans (a labour union group related to the Spanish CNT and FAI) called for political reforms, the universal suffrage vote of all Andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA\\'s hydroelectric power station in Encamp. On 5 April 1933 Joves Andorrans seized the Andorran Parliament. These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 gendarmes and the mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat.\\nOn 6 July 1934, adventurer and nobleman Boris Skossyreff, with his promise of freedoms and modernization of the country and wealth through the establishment of a tax haven and foreign investments, received the support of the members of the General Council to proclaim himself the sovereign of Andorra. On 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself Boris I, King of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell and approving the King\\'s constitution on 10 July. He was arrested by the Co-Prince and Bishop Justí Guitart i Vilardebó and their authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment of Garde Mobile led by well-known Colonel René-Jules Baulard was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain and also face the rise of Republicanism in the aftermath of the 1933 Revolution. During the Spanish Civil War, the inhabitants of Andorra welcomed refugees from both sides, and many of them settled permanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the capitalist era of Andorra. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.\\nDuring World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Francoist Spain, two fascist states. Many Andorrans criticized the passivity of the General Council for impeding both the entry and expulsion of foreigners and refugees, committing economic crimes, reducing the rights of citizens and sympathy with Francoism. General Council members justified the council\\'s political and diplomatic actions as necessary for Andorra\\'s survival and the protection of its sovereignty. Andorra was relatively unscathed by the two world wars and the Spanish Civil War. Certain groups formed to help victims of oppression in Nazi-occupied countries, while participating in smuggling to help Andorra survive. Among the most prominent was the Hostal Palanques Evasion Network Command, which, in contact with the British Mi6, helped almost 400 fugitives, among whom were Allied military personnel. The Command remained active between 1941 and 1944, although there were struggles with pro-Axis informers and Gestapo agents in Andorra.\\nIn the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda, culture and cinematic art not favorable to totalitarian regimes, promulgated in such places as the Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel, as a meeting place for Free French forces and a route for escorting crashed Allied pilots out of Europe. The network was maintained after the war, when film societies were formed, where movies, music and books censored in Franco\\'s Spain were imported, becoming an anti-censorship attraction for the Catalan or foreign public even within Andorra. Andorran Group (Agrupament Andorrà), an anti-fascist organization linked to the Occitanie\\'s French Resistance, accused the French representative (veguer) of collaboration with Nazism.\\nThe Andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two axes: mass tourism and the country\\'s tax exemption. The first steps toward the capitalist boom date from the 1930s, with the construction of FHASA and the creation of professional banking with Banc Agrícol (1930) and Crèdit Andorrà (1949), later with Banca Mora (1952), Banca Cassany (1958) and SOBANCA (1960). Shortly after activities such as skiing and shopping become a tourist attraction, with the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s. All in all, a renovated hotel industry has developed. In April 1968 a social health insurance system was created (CASS).\\nThe Andorran government necessarily involved planning, projection and forecasts for the future: with the official visit of the French co-prince Charles de Gaulle in 1967 and 1969, it was given approval for the economic boom and national demands within the framework of human rights and international openness.\\nAndorra lived an era commonly known as \"Andorran dream\" (in relation to the American dream) along with the Trente Glorieuses: the mass culture rooted the country experiencing radical changes in the economy and culture. Proof of this was Ràdio Andorra, the top musical radio station in Europe in this period, with guests and speakers of great importance promoting musical hits of chanson française, swing, rhythm &amp; blues, jazz, rock and roll and American country music. During this period Andorra achieved a GDP per capita and a life expectancy higher than the most standard countries of the current economy.\\nGiven its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal. But in recent times its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country has seen the need to reform Andorran institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d\\'Andorra, under the name of Executive Board (Consell Executiu), chaired by the first prime minister Òscar Ribas Reig with the co-princes\\' approval. In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the European Economic Community to regularize trade relations.\\nIts political system was modernized in 1993 after the Andorran constitutional referendum, when the constitution was drafted by the co-princes and the General Council and approved on 14 March by 74.2% of voters, with a 76% turnout. The first elections under the new constitution were held later in the year. The same year, Andorra became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.\\nAndorra formalized diplomatic relations with the United States in 1996, participating in the 51st UN General Assembly. First General Syndic Marc Forné took part on a speech in Catalan in the General Assembly to defend the reform of the organization, and after three days he took part in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to defend Andorra\\'s linguistic rights and economy. In 2006 a monetary agreement with the European Union was formalized that allows Andorra to use the euro in an official way, as well as coin its own euro currency.\\nPolitics.\\nAndorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the Bishop of Urgell and the president of France as co-princes. This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as prince of Andorra, an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy with a unicameral legislature, and of a pluriform multi-party system. The prime minister is the chief executive.\\nThe current Prime Minister is Xavier Espot Zamora of the Democrats for Andorra (DA). Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the General Syndic, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session, the prime minister is chosen from among the councillors.\\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be prime minister. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the prime minister of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the council as Private Members\\' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\\nThe council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.\\nIf the prime minister is not satisfied with the council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the prime minister from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the prime minister is removed.\\nLaw and criminal justice.\\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the prime minister, one each by the co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the judges and magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.\\nThe magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.\\nForeign relations, defence and security.\\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces, although there is a small ceremonial army. Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain. However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the Sometent (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve. This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need. Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU), it also has observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO). On 16 October 2020, Andorra became the 190th member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nMilitary.\\nAndorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army. The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the summoning of the Sometent (a civil defense organization of Andorra, made up of the heads of households). Being a landlocked country, Andorra has no navy.\\nBefore World War I, Andorra maintained an armed militia force of about 600 part-time militiamen under the supervision of a Captain (Capità or Cap de Sometent) and a Lieutenant (Desener or Lloctinent del Capità). This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (veguers) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.\\nIn the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties. Uniforms and weaponry were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.\\nThe army\\'s role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931. Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National Gendarmerie, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard. The Andorran Police was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles. The force consisted of six Corporals, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major. It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.\\nThe only permanent section of the present-day Sometent is a twelve-man ceremonial unit. However, all able-bodied men are technically available for military service, with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm. An area weapon such as a Shotgun per household is unregulated, however ranged weapons such as Pistols and Rifles require a license. The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions. According to Marc Forné Molné, Andorra\\'s military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.\\nIn more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of Sometent during the floods of 1982 in the Catalan Pyrenees, where 12 citizens perished in Andorra, to help the population and establish a public order along with the Local Police units.\\nPolice Corps.\\nAndorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants. The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing. There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.\\nGIPA.\\nThe \"Grup d\\'Intervenció Policia d\\'Andorra\" (GIPA) is a small special forces squad trained in counter-terrorism, and hostage recovery tasks. Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the Police Corps, and not the army. As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.\\nFire brigade.\\nThe Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at Santa Coloma, operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.\\nHistorically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943. Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961.\\nThe fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time: two at the brigade\\'s headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.\\nGeography.\\nParishes.\\nAndorra consists of seven parishes:\\nPhysical geography.\\nDue to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at , and the average elevation of Andorra is . These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Gran Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra\\'s lowest point of ). Andorra\\'s land area is .\\nEnvironment.\\nPhytogeographically, Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests. Andorra had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.45/10, ranking it 127th globally out of 172 countries.\\nImportant Bird Area.\\nThe whole country has been recognised as a single Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, because it is important for forest and mountain birds and supports populations of red-billed choughs, citril finches and rock buntings.\\nClimate.\\nAndorra has alpine, continental and oceanic climates, depending on altitude. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the Mediterranean climates make the country have a great diversity of microclimates that hinder the general dominance of the high mountain climate. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees.\\nWhen in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months). In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the Atlantic, which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains. The temperature regime is characterized, broadly, by a temperate summer and a long and cold winter, in accordance with the mountainous condition of the Principality.\\nEconomy.\\nTourism, the mainstay of Andorra\\'s tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10.2\\xa0million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra\\'s duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.\\nOne of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground. The sport brings in over 7 million visitors annually and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present since 2007.\\nThe banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP). However, during the European sovereign-debt crisis of the 21st century, the tourist industry suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, undercutting duty-free shopping and increasing unemployment. On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced, followed by a sales tax of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.\\nAgricultural production is limited; only 1.7% of the land is arable, and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra\\'s natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.\\nAndorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU\\'s single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.\\nAndorra has historically had one of the world\\'s lowest unemployment rates. In 2019 it stood at 2%.\\nOn 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members. The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Prime Minister Antoni Martí and the French President and Prince of Andorra François Hollande. Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra \"bringing its taxation in line with international standards\".\\nBy the mid-2010s, the financial system comprised five banking groups, one specialised credit entity, eight investment undertaking management entities, three asset management companies, and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.\\nDemographics.\\nPopulation.\\nThe population of Andorra is estimated at (). The Andorrans are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent. The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.\\nTwo-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections. Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as prime minister or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.\\nLanguages.\\nThe historic and official language is Catalan, a Romance language. The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan. It funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra (Catalan: ), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.\\nBecause of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, Portuguese and French are commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities.\\nAccording to mother tongue percentage statistics by the Andorran Government released in 2018 the principality has the following:\\nReligion.\\nThe population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic. Their patron saint is Our Lady of Meritxell. There are also members of various Protestant denominations. There are also small numbers of Muslims, Hindus, and Bahá\\'ís, and roughly 100 Jews. (See History of the Jews in Andorra.)\\nEducation.\\nSchools.\\nChildren between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.\\nThere are three systems of school, Andorran, French and Spanish, which use Catalan, French and Spanish languages respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. 39% of Andorran children attend Andorran schools, 33% attend French schools, and 28% Spanish schools.\\nUniversity of Andorra.\\nThe Universitat d\\'Andorra (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.\\nVirtual Studies Centre.\\nThe geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (Centre d\\'Estudis Virtuals) at the university runs approximately 20 different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.\\nTransport.\\nUntil the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours\\' drive from Andorra.\\nAndorra has a road network of , of which is unpaved. The two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border near Sant Julià de Lòria, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near El Pas de la Casa. Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and Toulouse, plus a daily tour from the former city. Bus services mostly are run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.\\nThere are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra\\'s borders but there are, however, heliports in La Massana (Camí Heliport), Arinsal and Escaldes-Engordany with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of Alt Urgell, south of the Andorran-Spanish border. Since July 2015, Andorra–La Seu d\\'Urgell Airport has operated commercial flights to Madrid and Palma de Mallorca, and is the main hub for Air Andorra and Andorra Airlines. As of 11 July 2018, there are no regular commercial flights at the airport.\\nNearby airports located in Spain and France provide access to international flights for the principality. The nearest airports are at Perpignan, France ( from Andorra) and Lleida, Spain ( from Andorra). The largest nearby airports are at Toulouse, France ( from Andorra) and Barcelona, Spain ( from Andorra). There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.\\nThe nearest railway station is Andorre-L\\'Hospitalet station east of Andorra which is on the -gauge line from Latour-de-Carol () southeast of Andorra, to Toulouse and on to Paris by the French high-speed trains. This line is operated by the SNCF. Latour-de-Carol has a scenic trainline to Villefranche-de-Conflent, as well as the SNCF\\'s gauge line connecting to Perpignan, and the RENFE\\'s -gauge line to Barcelona. There are also direct Intercités de Nuit trains between L\\'Hospitalet-près-l\\'Andorre and Paris on certain dates.\\nMedia and telecommunications.\\nIn Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as Andorra Telecom (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio. In 2010 Andorra became the first country to provide a direct optical fiber link to all homes (FTTH) and businesses.\\nThe first commercial radio station to broadcast was Radio Andorra, which was active from 1939 to 1981. On 12 October 1989, the General Council established radio and television as essential public services creating and managing the entity ORTA, becoming on 13 April 2000, in the public company Ràdio i Televisió d\\'Andorra (RTVA). In 1990, the public radio was founded on the Radio Nacional d\\'Andorra. As an autochthonous television channel, there is only the national public television network Andorra Televisió, created in 1995. Additional TV and radio stations from Spain and France are available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV.\\nThere are three national newspapers, \"Diari d\\'Andorra\", \"El Periòdic d\\'Andorra\", and \"Bondia\" as well as several local newspapers. The history of the Andorran press begins in the period between 1917 and 1937 with the appearance of several periodicals papers such as \"Les Valls d\\'Andorra\" (1917), \"Nova Andorra\" (1932) and \"Andorra Agrícola\" (1933). In 1974, the \"Poble Andorrà\" became the first regular newspaper in Andorra. There is also an amateur radio society and news agency ANA with independent management.\\nCulture.\\nAndorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially Catalan in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Anne\\'s dance in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra\\'s national holiday is Our Lady of Meritxell Day, 8 September.\\nAmong the more important festivals and traditions are the Canólich Gathering in May, the Roser d\\'Ordino in July, the Meritxell Day (National Day of Andorra), the Andorra la Vella Fair, the Sant Jordi Day, the Santa Llúcia Fair, the Festivity from La Candelera to Canillo, the Carnival of Encamp, the sung of caramelles, the Festivity of Sant Esteve and the Festa del Poble.\\nAndorra participated regularly in the Eurovision Song Contest between 2004 and 2009, being the only participating country presenting songs in Catalan.\\nIn popular folklore, the best-known Andorran legends are the legend of Charlemagne, according to which this Frankish King would have founded the country, the White Lady of Auvinyà, the Buner d\\'Ordino, the legend of Engolasters Lake and the legend of Our Lady of Meritxell.\\nAndorran gastronomy is mainly Catalan, although it has also adopted other elements of French and Italian cuisines. The cuisine of the country has similar characteristics with the neighbours of Cerdanya and Alt Urgell, with whom it has strong cultural ties. Andorra\\'s cuisine is marked by its nature as mountain valleys. Typical dishes of the country are quince all-i-oli, duck with winter pear, roast lamb with nuts, pork civet, massegada cake, escarole with pears, duck confit and mushrooms, escudella, spinach with raisins and pine nuts, jelly marmalade, stuffed murgues (mushrooms) with pork, dandelion salad, and Andorran river trout. To drink, mulled wine and beer are also popular. Some of the dishes are very common in the mountainous regions of Catalonia, such as trinxat, embotits, cooked snails, rice with mushrooms, mountain rice and mató.\\nPre-Romanesque and Romanesque art are one of the most important artistic manifestations and characteristics of the Principality. The Romanesque one allows to know the formation of the parochial communities, the relations of (social and political) power and the national culture. There are a total of forty Romanesque churches that stand out as being small austere ornamentation constructions, as well as bridges, fortresses and manor houses of the same period.\\nSummer solstice fire festivals in the Pyrenees was included as UNESCO Intangible cultural heritage in 2015. Also the Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley became Andorra\\'s first, and to date its only, UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, with a small extension in 2006.\\nSports.\\nAndorra is famous for the practice of winter sports. Andorra has the largest territory of ski slopes in the Pyrenees (3100 hectares and about 350\\xa0km of slopes) and two ski resorts. Grandvalira is the largest and most popular resort. Other popular sports played in Andorra include football, rugby union, basketball, and roller hockey.\\nFor roller hockey, Andorra usually plays in CERH Euro Cup and in FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup. In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the 2011 European League Final Eight.\\nThe country is represented in association football by the Andorra national football team. The team gained its first competitive win in a European Championship qualifier on 11 October 2019, against Moldova. Football is governed in Andorra by the Andorran Football Federation – founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football (Primera Divisió, Copa Constitució and Supercopa) and futsal. Andorra was admitted to UEFA and FIFA in the same year, 1996. FC Andorra, a club based in Andorra la Vella founded in 1942, compete in the Spanish football league system.\\nRugby is a traditional sport in Andorra, mainly influenced by the popularity in southern France. The Andorra national rugby union team, nicknamed Els Isards, plays on the international stage in rugby union and rugby sevens. VPC Andorra XV is a rugby team based in Andorra la Vella, which actually plays in the French championship.\\nBasketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s, when the Andorran team BC Andorra played in the top league of Spain (Liga ACB). After 18 years the club returned to the top league in 2014.\\nOther sports practised in Andorra include cycling, volleyball, judo, Australian Rules football, handball, swimming, gymnastics, tennis, and motorsports. In 2012, Andorra raised its first national cricket team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club, the first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of .\\nAndorra first participated at the Olympic Games in 1976. The country has appeared in every Winter Olympic Games since 1976. Andorra competes in the Games of the Small States of Europe, being twice the host country, in 1991 and 2005.\\nAs one of the Catalan Countries, Andorra is home to a team of castellers, or Catalan human tower builders. The , based in the town of Santa Coloma d\\'Andorra, are recognized by the , the governing body of castells.\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"609\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=609\" title=\"Andorra/Transnational issues\">\\nAndorra/Transnational issues\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"612\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612\" title=\"Arithmetic mean\">\\nArithmetic mean\\n\\nIn mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( ), arithmetic average, or just the \"mean\" or \"average\" (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection. The collection is often a set of results from an experiment, an observational study, or a survey. The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because it helps distinguish it from other types of means, such as geometric and harmonic.\\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is frequently used in economics, anthropology, history, and almost every academic field to some extent. For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation\\'s population.\\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic: it is greatly influenced by outliers (values much larger or smaller than most others). For skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people\\'s incomes are substantially higher than most people\\'s, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one\\'s notion of \"middle\". In that case, robust statistics, such as the median, may provide a better description of central tendency.\\nDefinition.\\nGiven a data set formula_1, the \"arithmetic mean\" (also \"mean\" or \"average\"), denoted formula_2 (read formula_3 \"bar\"), is the mean of the formula_4 values formula_5.\\nThe arithmetic mean is a data set\\'s most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency. In statistics, the term average refers to any measurement of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is equal to the sum of the numerical values of each observation, divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, for a data set consisting of the values formula_6, the arithmetic mean formula_7 is defined by the formula:\\nFor example, if the monthly salaries of formula_9 employees are formula_10, then the arithmetic mean is:\\nIf the data set is a statistical population (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the \"population mean\" and denoted by the Greek letter formula_12. If the data set is a statistical sample (a subset of the population), it is called the \"sample mean\" (which for a data set formula_13 is denoted as formula_14).\\nThe arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimensions, not only scalar values; this is often referred to as a centroid. More generally, because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination (meaning its coefficients sum to formula_15), it can be defined on a convex space, not only a vector space.\\nMotivating properties.\\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it interesting, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:\\nContrast with median.\\nThe arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger, and no more than half are smaller than it. If elements in the data increase arithmetically when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample formula_23. The mean is formula_24, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged to increase arithmetically, such as formula_25, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is formula_26, while the median is formula_27. The average value can vary considerably from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most.\\nThere are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.\\nGeneralizations.\\nWeighted average.\\nA weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"615\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615\" title=\"American Football Conference\">\\nAmerican Football Conference\\n\\nThe American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. The AFC and its counterpart, the National Football Conference (NFC), each contain 16 teams with 4 divisions. Both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the National Football League, and the American Football League (AFL). All ten of the AFL teams, and three NFL teams, became members of the new AFC, with the remaining thirteen NFL teams forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference. The current AFC champions are the Cincinnati Bengals, who defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2022 AFC Championship Game for their third conference championship, and their first since 1988.\\nTeams.\\nLike the NFC, the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams: East, North, South and West.\\nSeason structure.\\nThis chart of the 2021 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The Bengals in 2021 (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the AFC North. Thus, in 2021, the Bengals are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the AFC East and NFC South (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the AFC South, AFC West (highlighted in orange), and NFC East (highlighted in pink).\\nCurrently, the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:\\nEach AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL: three games are assigned on the basis of a particular team\\'s final divisional standing from the previous season, and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2021 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC East. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the three games assigned based on the team\\'s prior-season divisional standing.\\nAt the end of each season, the four division winners and three wild cards (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the AFC qualify for the playoffs. The AFC playoffs culminate in the AFC Championship Game, with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy. The AFC champion then plays the NFC champion in the Super Bowl.\\nHistory.\\nBoth the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL\\'s launch (the Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and the then-Baltimore Colts) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions AFL East and AFL West were more or less intact, while the NFL\\'s Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central. Upon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970, the newly minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the 1970 season; the National Football Conference, however, could not agree upon their setup, and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16, 1970.\\nSince the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the Baltimore Colts relocated to Indianapolis. In 1995, the Cleveland Browns had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting dispute between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the Baltimore Ravens with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL. The Ravens were treated as an expansion team.\\nIn California, the Oakland Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, back to Oakland in 1995, and then to Las Vegas in 2020, while the San Diego Chargers returned to Los Angeles in 2017 after 56 years in San Diego.\\nThe Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the Tennessee Titans.\\nThe NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the Houston Texans to the AFC. With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup has remained static ever since.\\nBetween 1995 and 2021, the AFC has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the Super Bowl: New England Patriots (10 times), Pittsburgh Steelers (4 times), Denver Broncos (4 times), Baltimore Ravens (2 times), Indianapolis Colts (2 times), Kansas City Chiefs (2 times), Cincinnati Bengals (1 time), Las Vegas Raiders (1 time), Tennessee Titans (1 time). By contrast, the NFC has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only the Detroit Lions, Minnesota Vikings, and Washington Commanders missing out on an appearance in the Super Bowl. 17 of the 19 AFC champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three quarterbacks - Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger - in the Super Bowl. The AFC has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 Super Bowls, while the NFC has started 16.\\nLogo.\\nThe merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the \"A\" and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.\\nTelevision.\\nNBC aired the AFC\\'s Sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season. From 1998 to 2013, CBS was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC; in those years, all interconference games in which the AFC team was the visiting team were broadcast on either NBC or CBS. Since 2014, the cross-flex policy allows select AFC games (that involve them playing an NFC team at home or intraconference games) to be moved from CBS to Fox. Since 1990, select AFC playoff games have been seen on ABC or ESPN.\\nSee also.\\nAFC Divisions\\nAFC Division Rivals\\nAFC East\\nAFC North\\nAFC South Rivals\\nAFC West Rivals\\nAFC Interdivisional Rivals\\nAFC Television Network\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"617\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617\" title=\"Albert Gore\">\\nAlbert Gore\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"618\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618\" title=\"AnEnquiryConcerningHumanUnderstanding\">\\nAnEnquiryConcerningHumanUnderstanding\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"620\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620\" title=\"Animal Farm\">\\nAnimal Farm\\n\\nAnimal Farm is a beast fable, in the form of satirical allegorical novella, by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. It tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon, the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before.\\nAccording to Orwell, \"Animal Farm\" reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona May Days conflicts between the POUM and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described \"Animal Farm\" as a satirical tale against Stalin (\"\"), and in his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), wrote that \"Animal Farm\" was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".\\nThe original title was \"Animal Farm: A Fairy Story\", but US publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell\\'s lifetime, the Telugu version, kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like \"A Satire\" and \"A Contemporary Satire\". Orwell suggested the title \\' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the Latin word for \"bear\", a symbol of Russia. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, \\'.\\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated. The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers, including one of Orwell\\'s own, Victor Gollancz, which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the Cold War.\\n\"Time\" magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels, and number 46 on the BBC\\'s The Big Read poll. It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is included in the Great Books of the Western World selection.\\nPlot summary.\\nThe poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon, England, is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, Mr. Jones. One night, the exalted boar, Old Major, holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"Beasts of England\". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal\". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the \"Battle of the Cowshed\"), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill. Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to a head, which culminate in Napoleon\\'s dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander.\\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young porker named Squealer, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project, and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by Napoleon of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. \"Beasts of England\" is replaced with \"Animal Farm\", while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who is presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man (\"Comrade Napoleon\"), is composed and sung. Napoleon then conducts a second purge, during which many animals who are alleged to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon\\'s dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleon\\'s retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheep\\'s continual bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad\".\\nMr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a knacker\\'s van and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner\\'s signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer\\'s death and honours him with a festival the following day. (However, Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves.)\\nYears pass, the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. Snowball has been forgotten, alongside Boxer, with \"the exception of the few who knew him\". Many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones is also dead we learn, having \"died in an inebriates\\' home in another part of the country\". The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\". The maxim \"Four legs good, two legs bad\" is similarly changed to \"Four legs good, two legs better\". Other changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and Old Major\\'s skull, which was previously put on display, being reburied.\\nNapoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the Ace of Spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.\\nGenre and style.\\nGeorge Orwell\\'s \"Animal Farm\" is an example of a political satire and an allegory that was intended to have a \"wider application\", according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance. Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell\\'s other works, most notably \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", as both have been considered works of Swiftian satire. Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell\\'s bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in \"Animal Farm\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War. Orwell\\'s style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing. \\nOrwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse. For this reason, he is careful, in \"Animal Farm\", to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion. The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires. This style reflects Orwell\\'s close proximation to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin\\'s Soviet Russia.\\nBackground.\\nOrigin and writing.\\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944 after his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which he described in \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of \"Animal Farm\", he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries\". This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. \"Homage to Catalonia\" sold poorly; after seeing Arthur Koestler\\'s best-selling, \"Darkness at Noon\", about the Moscow Trials, Orwell decided that fiction would be the best way to describe totalitarianism.\\nImmediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the BBC. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.\\nIn the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:\\nIn 1944, the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London home. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact.\\nPublication.\\nPublishing.\\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publish \"Animal Farm\", yet one had initially accepted the work, but declined it after consulting the Ministry of Information. Eventually, Secker and Warburg published the first edition in 1945.\\nDuring the Second World War, it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch\\xa0– including his regular publisher Gollancz. He also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber, where the poet T. S. Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book\\'s \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally Trotskyite\". Eliot said he found the view \"not convincing\", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue \"what was needed\\xa0... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs\". Orwell let André Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson &amp; Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson &amp; Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and \"lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in \"Animal Farm\"\". In his \"London Letter\" on 17 April 1944 for \"Partisan Review\", Orwell wrote that it was \"now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle\".\\nThe publisher Jonathan Cape, who had initially accepted \"Animal Farm\", subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off\\xa0– although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy. Writing to Leonard Moore, a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the \"important official\" was a man named Peter Smollett, who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent. Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell included in his list of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:\\nFrederic Warburg also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the Red Army, which had played a major part in defeating Adolf Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper \"Posev\", and in giving permission for a Russian translation of \"Animal Farm\", Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.\\nIn October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist David Low might illustrate \"Animal Farm\". Low had written a letter saying that he had had \"a good time with \"Animal Farm\"\\xa0– an excellent bit of satire\\xa0– it would illustrate perfectly\". Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned. The Folio Society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by Quentin Blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of \"Animal Farm\".\\nPreface.\\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:\\nAlthough the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included, and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.\\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of \"Animal Farm\" in 1945, without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author\\'s proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.\\nIn 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled \"The Freedom of the Press\", and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction, in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" on 15 September 1972 as \"How the essay came to be written\". Orwell\\'s essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government. The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of \"Animal Farm\" with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.\\nReception.\\nContemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American \"New Republic\" magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it \"puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly\". Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, \"It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well\".\\n\"The Guardian\" on 24 August 1945 called \"Animal Farm\" \"a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few\". Tosco Fyvel, writing in \"Tribune\" on the same day, called the book \"a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us\". Julian Symons responded, on 7 September, \"Should we not expect, in \"Tribune\" at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State\\xa0– Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, \"Animal Farm\" may be simply a fairy story; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point\". \"Animal Farm\" has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.\\nBetween 1952 and 1957, the CIA, in an operation codenamed Aedinosaur, sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.\\n\"Time\" magazine chose \"Animal Farm\" as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels. It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is included in the Great Books of the Western World selection.\\nPopular reading in schools, \"Animal Farm\" was ranked the UK\\'s favourite book from school in a 2016 poll.\\n\"Animal Farm\" has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US. The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell\\'s work:\\n\"Animal Farm\" has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries. The ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow, Russia, in 1977 and banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs, such as pigs or alcohol.\\nIn the same manner, \"Animal Farm\" has also faced relatively recent issues in China. In 2018, the government made the decision to censor all online posts about or referring to \"Animal Farm\". However the book itself, as of 2019, remains sold in stores. Amy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom of \"The Atlantic\" stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in Mainland China for several reasons: censors believe the general public is unlikely to read a highbrow book, because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway, and because the Communist Party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability. The authors stated \"It was\\xa0– and remains\\xa0– as easy to buy \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\" in Shenzhen or Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles\".\\nAn enhanced version of the book, launched in India in 2017, was widely praised for capturing the author\\'s intent, by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition.\\nAnalysis.\\nAnimalism.\\nThe pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major\\'s ideas into \"a complete system of thought\", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to Communism, not to be confused with the philosophy Animalism. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an allusion to the Soviet government\\'s revising of history in order to exercise control of the people\\'s beliefs about themselves and their society.\\nThe original commandments are:\\nThese commandments are also distilled into the maxim \"Four legs good, two legs bad!\" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.\\nLater, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:\\nEventually, these are replaced with the maxims, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\", and \"Four legs good, two legs better\" as the pigs become more anthropomorphic. This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans\\' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.\\nSignificance and allegory.\\nOrwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, \"virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory\". Orwell himself wrote in 1946, \"Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution\\xa0... [and] \"that kind\" of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters\\xa0[–] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert\". In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, \"for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages\".\\nThe revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell\\'s analogy with the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The \"Battle of the Cowshed\" has been said to represent the allied invasion of Soviet Russia in 1918, and the defeat of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. The pigs\\' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon\\'s emergence as the farm\\'s sole leader reflects Stalin\\'s emergence. The pigs\\' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, \"the turning point of the story\" as Orwell termed it in a letter to Dwight Macdonald, stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 Kronstadt revolt against the Bolsheviks, and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various Five Year Plans. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs\\' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s. In chapter seven, when the animals confess their non-existent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and show trials of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell\\'s conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.\\nPeter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Davison contend that the \"Battle of the Windmill\", specifically referencing the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow, represents World War II. During the battle, Orwell first wrote, \"All the animals, including Napoleon\" took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to \"All the animals except Napoleon\" in recognition of Stalin\\'s decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance. Orwell requested the change after he met Józef Czapski in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the Katyn Massacre and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to Arthur Koestler, that it had been \"the character [and] greatness of Stalin\" that saved Russia from the German invasion.\\nOther connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell\\'s telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and in Germany (Ch. IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch. V), parallelling \"the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: Trotskyism, with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia\\'s socialist destiny\"; Napoleon\\'s dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch. VI), paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo; and Frederick\\'s forged bank notes, parallelling the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939, after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.\\nThe book\\'s close, with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement, reflected Orwell\\'s view of the 1943 Tehran Conference that seemed to display the establishment of \"the best possible relations between the USSR and the West\"\\xa0– but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel. The disagreement between the allies and the start of the Cold War is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, each \"played an ace of spades simultaneously\".\\nSimilarly, the music in the novel, starting with \"Beasts of England\" and the later anthems, parallels \"The Internationale\" and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.\\nAdaptations.\\nStage productions.\\nIn 2021, during pandemic restrictions, the National Youth Theatre toured a stage version of \"Animal Farm;\" this run included outdoor performances on a farm at Soulton Hall.\\nA solo version, adapted and performed by Guy Masterson, premiered at the Traverse Theatre Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.\\nA theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell, was staged at the National Theatre London on 25 April 1984, directed by Peter Hall. It toured nine cities in 1985.\\nA new adaptation written and directed by Robert Icke, designed by Bunny Christie with puppetry designed and directed by Toby Olié opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 2022 before touring the UK.\\nFilms.\\n\"Animal Farm\" has been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects.\\nAndy Serkis is directing an upcoming animated film adaptation with Matt Reeves producing.\\nRadio dramatisations.\\nA BBC radio version, produced by Rayner Heppenstall, was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, with Hugh Gordon Porteous, amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, \"who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes\".\\nA further radio production, again using Orwell\\'s own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC Radio 4. Tamsin Greig narrated, and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon, Toby Jones as the propagandist Squealer, and Ralph Ineson as Boxer.\\nComic strip.\\nIn 1950, Norman Pett and his writing partner Don Freeman were secretly hired by the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret wing of the British Foreign Office, to adapt \"Animal Farm\" into a comic strip. This comic was not published in the UK but ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers.\\n\\n</doc>\\n'"

       "\"Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with \\tstateless societies or other forms of free associations . \\nAs a historically left-wing movement , usually placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum , it is \\tusually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing ( libertarian socialism ) of the socialist movement . \\nHumans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the \\testablishment of formal states , realms , or empires . \\nWith the rise of organised hierarchical bodies \\t, scepticism toward authority also rose . \\nAlthough traces of anarchist thought are found throughout \\thistory , modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment . \\nDuring the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement \\tflourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers ' struggles for emancipation . \\nVarious anarchist schools of thought \\tformed during this period . \\nAnarchists have taken part in several revolutions , most notably in the Paris Commune , the Russian Civil \\tWar and the Spanish Civil War , whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism . \\nIn the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century , the anarchist movement has \\tbeen resurgent once more , growing in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist , anti-war and anti-globalisation movements . \\nAnarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated \\tinto revolutionary and evolutionary tactics ; there is significant overlap between the two , which are merely descriptive . \\nRevolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , having taken a violent turn in \\tthe past , while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like . \\nAnarchist thought , criticism , and praxis have played \\ta part in diverse areas of human society . \\nEtymology , terminology \\t, and definition . \\nThe etymological origin of `` anarchism '' is from the Ancient Greek `` anarkhia '' , meaning `` without a ruler '' , composed of \\tthe prefix `` an- '' ( `` without '' ) and the word `` arkhos '' ( `` leader '' or `` ruler '' ) . \\nThe suffix `` -ism '' denotes \\tthe ideological current that favours anarchy . \\n`` Anarchism '' appears in English from 1642 as `` anarchisme '' and `` \\tanarchy '' from 1539 ; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder . \\nVarious factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as `` anarchists \\t'' , although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists . \\nMany revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin ( 1756–1836 ) and Wilhelm Weitling ( 1808–1871 ) would contribute to the \\tanarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use `` anarchist '' or `` anarchism '' in describing themselves or their beliefs . \\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an `` anarchist '' ( ) was Pierre-Joseph \\tProudhon ( 1809–1865 ) , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century . \\nSince the 1890s and beginning in France , `` libertarianism '' has often been used as a \\tsynonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States . \\nSome usages of `` libertarianism '' refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only \\t, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed `` libertarian anarchism '' . \\nWhile the term `` libertarian '' has been largely synonymous with anarchism , its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups , including both the \\tNew Left and libertarian Marxists , who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party , and extreme cultural liberals , who are primarily concerned with civil liberties . \\nAdditionally , some anarchists use `` libertarian socialist '' to avoid \\tanarchism 's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism . \\n`` Anarchism '' is broadly used to describe \\tthe anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement . \\nAnarchism is contrasted to socialist forms \\twhich are state-oriented or from above . \\nScholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism 's socialist credentials \\tand criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two . \\nSome scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism , and being both liberals and \\tsocialists but more so , while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles . \\nWhile opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought , defining `` anarchism '' is not an easy task for scholars , \\tas there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter , and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently . \\nMajor definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society , the rejection of the state apparatus , the belief that human nature allows humans \\tto exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society , and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPre-modern \\tera . \\nBefore the creation of towns and cities \\t, established authority did not exist . \\nIt was after the institution of authority that \\tanarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction . \\nThe most notable precursors to anarchism in the \\tancient world were in China and Greece . \\nIn China , philosophical anarchism ( the discussion on the legitimacy of \\tthe state ) was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuang Zhou and Laozi . \\nAlongside Stoicism , Taoism has been said to \\thave had `` significant anticipations '' of anarchism . \\nAnarchic attitudes were also articulated by \\ttragedians and philosophers in Greece . \\nAeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the \\tconflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy . \\nSocrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on \\tthe right of individual freedom of conscience . \\nCynics dismissed human law ( `` nomos '' ) and associated authorities \\twhile trying to live according to nature ( `` physis '' ) . \\nStoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly \\trelations among its citizens without the presence of a state . \\nIn medieval Europe , there was no \\tanarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements . \\nThese , and other Muslim movements , \\tlater gave birth to religious anarchism . \\nIn the Sasanian Empire , Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the \\tabolition of monarchy , only to be soon executed by Emperor Kavad I . \\nIn Basra , religious sects \\tpreached against the state . \\nIn Europe , various sects \\tdeveloped anti-state and libertarian tendencies . \\nRenewed interest in antiquity during the Renaissance and in private judgment during \\tthe Reformation restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism , particularly in France . \\nEnlightenment challenges to intellectual authority ( secular and religious ) and the revolutions of the 1790s \\tand 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism . \\nModern \\tera . \\nDuring the French Revolution , partisan groups such as the Enragés and the \\tsaw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments . \\nThe first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England , morally delegitimising the state \\t, Max Stirner 's thinking paved the way to individualism and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon 's theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France . \\nBy the late 1870s , various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined \\tand a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914 . \\nThis era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the \\tSpanish Civil War and is considered the golden age of anarchism . \\nDrawing from mutualism , Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen 's Association , a \\tclass worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents . \\nThe International became a significant political force , with Karl Marx \\tbeing a leading figure and a member of its General Council . \\nBakunin 's faction ( the Jura Federation ) and Proudhon 's followers ( the \\tmutualists ) opposed state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . \\nAfter bitter disputes , the Bakuninists were expelled from the \\tInternational by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress . \\nAnarchists were treated similarly in the Second \\tInternational , being ultimately expelled in 1896 . \\nBakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx 's \\tterms , they would end up the new tyrants of workers . \\nIn response to their expulsion from the First \\tInternational , anarchists formed the St. Imier International . \\nUnder the influence of Peter Kropotkin , a Russian \\tphilosopher and scientist , anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism . \\nAnarcho-communists , who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune , advocated for \\tfree federation and for the distribution of goods according to one 's needs . \\nAt the turn of the century , \\tanarchism had spread all over the world . \\nIt was a notable feature \\tof the international syndicalism movement . \\nIn China , small groups of students \\timported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism . \\nTokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the \\tfar east , travelling to the Japanese capital to study . \\nIn Latin America , Argentina was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism \\t, where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology . \\nDuring this time , a minority of \\tanarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence . \\nThis strategy became known as \\tpropaganda of the deed . \\nThe dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many \\tCommunards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts . \\nEven though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts , infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made \\tto exclude them from American immigration , including the Immigration Act of 1903 , also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act . \\nIllegalism was another strategy which some \\tanarchists adopted during this period . \\nDespite concerns , anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution in opposition to the White \\tmovement ; however , they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilised . \\nSeveral anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine , \\tnotably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and the Makhnovist movement . \\nWith the anarchists being crushed in Russia , two new \\tantithetical currents emerged , namely platformism and synthesis anarchism . \\nThe former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution \\twhile the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party . \\nSeeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War , many \\tworkers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . \\nIn France and the United States , members of major syndicalist movements such as the General Confederation \\tof Labour and the Industrial Workers of the World left their organisations and joined the Communist International . \\nIn the Spanish Civil War of 1936 , anarchists and syndicalists ( CNT \\tand FAI ) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists . \\nA long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to \\tanarchists playing a pivotal role in the war . \\nIn response to the army rebellion , an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias \\t, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain , where they collectivised the land . \\nThe Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war , but the result was a bitter fight among \\tcommunists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans . \\nPost-war \\tera . \\nBy the end of World War II , \\tthe anarchist movement had been severely weakened . \\nThe 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism , likely caused by a \\tperceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War . \\nDuring this time , anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as \\tthe anti-nuclear , environmental , and peace movements , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the New Left . \\nIt also saw a transition from its \\tprevious revolutionary nature to provocative anti-capitalist reformism . \\nAnarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by \\tbands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols . \\nThe established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with \\tvigour during the second wave of feminism . \\nBlack anarchism began to take form at this time \\tand influenced anarchism 's move from a Eurocentric demographic . \\nThis coincided with its failure to gain traction in \\tNorthern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America . \\nAround the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in \\tpopularity and influence within anti-capitalist , anti-war and anti-globalisation movements . \\nAnarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization \\t( WTO ) , the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum . \\nDuring the protests , `` ad hoc '' leaderless anonymous cadres known as black \\tblocs engaged in rioting , property destruction and violent confrontations with the police . \\nOther organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups , security \\tculture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet . \\nA significant event of this period was the \\tconfrontations at the 1999 Seattle WTO conference . \\nAnarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern \\tSyria , more commonly known as Rojava , a `` de facto '' autonomous region in northern Syria . \\nWhile having revolutionary aspirations , many forms \\tof anarchism are not confrontational nowadays . \\nInstead , they are trying to build an alternative way of \\tsocial organization , based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation . \\nScholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of Food not Bombs group of collectives , to highlight some features \\tof how anarchist groups work : direct action , working together and in solidarity with those left behind . \\nWhile doing so , they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policies to tackle hunger , raging \\tfrom de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents , helping farmers and commodification of food and housing . \\nHoneywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not \\tonly of humans , but non-humans and the environment as well . \\nHoneywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only can not solve those pressing \\tproblems for humanity , but are causal factors as well , resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole . \\nThought \\t. \\nAnarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions , social \\tanarchism and individualist anarchism , owing to their different origins , values and evolution . \\nThe individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual , while the social current \\temphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership . \\nIn a chronological sense , anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th \\tcentury and the post-classical currents ( anarcha-feminism , green anarchism , and post-anarchism ) developed thereafter . \\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that \\tthe state lacks moral legitimacy , without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it . \\nA component especially of individualist anarchism , philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state \\tbut claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy . \\nAnarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since \\tethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy . \\nAnarchism 's emphasis on anti-capitalism , egalitarianism , and for the extension of community \\tand individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism . \\nAnarchism is usually placed on the \\tfar-left of the political spectrum . \\nMuch of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian , anti-statist , libertarian , and radical interpretations of left-wing and socialist \\tpolitics such as collectivism , communism , individualism , mutualism , and syndicalism , among other libertarian socialist economic theories . \\nAs anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular \\tworldview , many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely . \\nOne reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives , a call for toleration and unity among anarchists \\tfirst adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time . \\nBelief in political nihilism has \\tbeen espoused by anarchists . \\nDespite separation , the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through \\ta set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy , mutual aid , network organisation , communal democracy , justified authority and decentralisation . \\nClassical \\t. \\nInceptive currents among classical anarchist \\tcurrents were mutualism and individualism . \\nThey were followed by the major currents of social \\tanarchism ( collectivist , communist and syndicalist ) . \\nThey differ on organisational and economic \\taspects of their ideal society . \\nMutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was \\tdeveloped into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . \\nIts aims include reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation and monetary reform \\tof both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people . \\nMutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated \\tbetween individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism . \\nIn `` What \\tIs Property ? '' \\n( 1840 ) , Proudhon first characterised his goal as a `` \\tthird form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . '' \\nCollectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form \\tof anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin . \\nCollectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and \\tthat workers be paid according to time worked , rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism . \\nCollectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the \\tproletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society . \\nAnarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations , workers \\t' councils and worker cooperatives , with production and consumption based on the guiding principle `` From each according to his ability , to each according to his need . '' \\nAnarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was \\tfirst formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International . \\nIt was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin , whose specific \\tstyle would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century . \\nAnarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary \\tsocial change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers . \\nThe basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are direct action \\t, workers ' solidarity and workers ' self-management . \\nIndividualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement \\tthat emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants . \\nEarly influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William \\tGodwin , Max Stirner , and Henry David Thoreau . \\nThrough many countries , individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and \\tintellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation . \\nPost-classical and \\tcontemporary . \\nAnarchist principles undergird contemporary radical \\tsocial movements of the left . \\nInterest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation \\tmovement , whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation . \\nAs the movement shaped 21st century radicalism , wider \\tembrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest . \\nAnarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , \\tdrawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches . \\nThe anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism \\thas remained prominent within contemporary currents . \\nContemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has \\treinforced anarchism 's historical association with chaos and violence . \\nIts publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to \\tengage with the anarchist movement , although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory . \\nVarious anarchist groups , tendencies , and schools of thought exist \\ttoday , making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement . \\nWhile theorists and activists have established `` relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles '' , there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple `` \\tanarchisms '' , rather than a singular `` anarchism '' , in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently . \\nGender equality can be a common principle , although it \\tranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists . \\nAnarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms , namely `` all centralized and \\thierarchical forms of government ( e.g. , monarchy , representative democracy , state socialism , etc . \\n) , economic class systems ( e.g. , capitalism \\t, Bolshevism , feudalism , slavery , etc . \\n) , autocratic religions ( e.g. , \\tfundamentalist Islam , Roman Catholicism , etc . \\n) , patriarchy , heterosexism , \\twhite supremacy , and imperialism . '' \\nAnarchist schools disagree on the methods by \\twhich these forms should be opposed . \\nThe principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics \\tin that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions . \\nThis entails that liberty and equality can not be implemented within the state \\t, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy . \\nTactics \\t. \\nAnarchists ' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals , namely to first oppose the Establishment and \\tsecondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society , illustrating the unity of means and ends . \\nA broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary \\tmeans on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other . \\nEvolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence , reject violence and take a gradual approach \\tto anarchist aims , although there is significant overlap between the two . \\nAnarchist tactics have shifted during the \\tcourse of the last century . \\nAnarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and \\tmilitancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches . \\nClassical \\tera . \\nDuring the classical era , \\tanarchists had a militant tendency . \\nNot only did they confront state armed forces , as in Spain and Ukraine \\t, but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed . \\nAssassination attempts were carried out against heads of \\tstate , some of which were successful . \\nAnarchists also took \\tpart in revolutions . \\nMany anarchists , especially the Galleanists , believed that these attempts would \\tbe the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state . \\nMany of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late \\t1870s , the early 1880s and the 1890s , with some still occurring in the early 1900s . \\nTheir decrease in prevalence was the result of further \\tjudicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions . \\nAnarchist perspectives towards violence \\thave always been controversial . \\nAnarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to \\tachieve their stateless , nonviolent ends . \\nOther anarchist groups advocate direct action , a tactic \\twhich can include acts of sabotage or terrorism . \\nThis attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and \\tsome anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible . \\nEmma Goldman and Errico Malatesta , who were proponents of limited use of violence , \\tstated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil . \\nAnarchists took an active role in strike actions , although they tended \\tto be antipathetic to formal syndicalism , seeing it as reformist . \\nThey saw it as a part of the movement \\twhich sought to overthrow the state and capitalism . \\nAnarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts \\t, some of whom practiced naturism and nudism . \\nThose anarchists also built communities which were based on \\tfriendship and were involved in the news media . \\nRevolutionary \\t. \\nIn the current era , Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno , a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism , has reinstated the debate \\ton violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards . \\nBoth Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small , informal affiliation groups , where each member is responsible for their \\town actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state , capitalism , and other enemies . \\nMembers of The Invisible Committee were arrested in \\t2008 on various charges , terrorism included . \\nOverall , contemporary anarchists are much less \\tviolent and militant than their ideological ancestors . \\nThey mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots , \\tespecially in countries such as Canada , Greece , and Mexico . \\nMilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police ; however , anarchists not only clash with state operators , \\tthey also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists , taking anti-fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening . \\nEvolutionary \\t. \\nAnarchists commonly employ \\tdirect action . \\nThis can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy , or the form \\tof self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives . \\nDecision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way , with everyone having \\tequal say in each decision , an approach known as horizontalism . \\nContemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism , \\talthough not explicitly anarchist , respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations . \\nIn contrast with the `` big-A anarchism '' of the classical era , the newly coined term `` small-a anarchism '' signals their tendency not to \\tbase their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions . \\nThose anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis \\ton their own experience which they will later theorize . \\nThe decision-making process of small anarchist affinity \\tgroups plays a significant tactical role . \\nAnarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members \\tof their group without the need of a leader or a leading group . \\nOne way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to \\thelp achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point . \\nMinorities usually accept rough consensus , except when they feel \\tthe proposal contradicts anarchist ethics , goals and values . \\nAnarchists usually form small groups ( 5–20 individuals ) \\tto enhance autonomy and friendships among their members . \\nThese kinds of groups more often than not \\tinterconnect with each other , forming larger networks . \\nAnarchists still support and participate in strikes , especially wildcat strikes \\tas these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate . \\nAs in the past , newspapers and journals are used , and anarchists \\thave gone online in the World Wide Web to spread their message . \\nAnarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional \\tand other difficulties , hosting electronic libraries and other portals . \\nAnarchists were also involved in developing various \\tsoftware that are available for free . \\nThe way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals \\t, especially when it comes to preserving users ' privacy from state surveillance . \\nAnarchists organize themselves to squat \\tand reclaim public spaces . \\nDuring important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied , they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones \\t( TAZ ) , spaces where art , poetry , and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal . \\nAs seen by anarchists , squatting is a way to regain urban space from \\tthe capitalist market , serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action . \\nAcquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with \\ttheir ideas and build social bonds . \\nAdding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them , along with \\tvarious forms of protesting at highly symbolic events , make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity . \\nKey \\tissues . \\nAs anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies , and schools \\tof thought ; disagreement over questions of values , ideology , and tactics is common . \\nIts diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different \\tanarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory . \\nThe compatibility of capitalism , nationalism , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed , and anarchism \\tenjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism , collectivism , Marxism , and trade unionism . \\nAnarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened \\tself-interest , veganism , or any number of alternative ethical doctrines . \\nPhenomena such as civilisation \\t, technology ( e.g . \\nwithin anarcho-primitivism ) , and the democratic process may be sharply \\tcriticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others . \\nThe \\tstate . \\nObjection to the state and its institutions is \\ta `` sine qua non '' of anarchism . \\nAnarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and \\tbelieve it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies . \\nInstead of people being able to control the aspects of their \\tlife , major decisions are taken by a small elite . \\nAuthority ultimately rests solely on power , regardless of whether that power is \\topen or transparent , as it still has the ability to coerce people . \\nAnother anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government , even the most \\taltruistic among officials , will unavoidably seek to gain more power , leading to corruption . \\nAnarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an \\tunachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society . \\nSpecific anarchist attitudes towards \\tthe state vary . \\nRobert Paul Wolff believed that the tension between authority and \\tautonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate . \\nBakunin saw the state as meaning `` coercion , domination by means of \\tcoercion , camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be . '' \\nA. John Simmons and Leslie Green , who leaned toward philosophical anarchism , believed that the state \\tcould be legitimate if it is governed by consensus , although they saw this as highly unlikely . \\nBeliefs on how to abolish \\tthe state also differ . \\nGender , sexuality , \\tand free love . \\nAs gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy , many anarchists address , \\tanalyse , and oppose the suppression of one 's autonomy imposed by gender roles . \\nSexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that \\tdid felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing . \\nSexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker , who \\topposed age of consent laws , believing they would benefit predatory men . \\nA historical current that arose and flourished during \\t1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love . \\nIn contemporary anarchism , this current survives as \\ta tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism . \\nFree love advocates were against marriage , which they saw as a way of men \\timposing authority over women , largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men . \\nThe notion of free love was much broader and included a critique \\tof the established order that limited women 's sexual freedom and pleasure . \\nThose free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses , where \\tlarge groups of travelers , anarchists and other activists slept in beds together . \\nFree love had roots both in Europe and the United States ; however \\t, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love . \\nAnarchist feminists were advocates of free love , against marriage , and pro-choice \\t( utilising a contemporary term ) , and had a similar agenda . \\nAnarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage \\tbut were supportive of one another . \\nDuring the second half of the 20th century , anarchism intermingled with the second wave \\tof feminism , radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well . \\nBy the latest decades of the 20th century , anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women \\t, gays , queers and other marginalised groups , with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents . \\nWith the third wave of feminism , sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a \\tsubject of study for anarchists , yielding a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality . \\nSome anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking , suggesting that it \\tleaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation . \\nEducation \\t. \\nThe interest of anarchists in education stretches back \\tto the first emergence of classical anarchism . \\nAnarchists consider proper education , one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy \\tof the individual and the society , to be an act of mutual aid . \\nAnarchist writers such as William Godwin ( `` Political Justice '' ) and Max Stirner ( `` The False Principle of Our \\tEducation '' ) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges . \\nIn 1901 , Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela Moderna in Barcelona \\tas an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church . \\nFerrer 's approach was secular , rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational \\tprocess whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance . \\nFerrer aimed to educate the working class and \\texplicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students . \\nThe school closed after constant harassment by \\tthe state and Ferrer was later arrested . \\nNonetheless , his ideas formed the inspiration for \\ta series of modern schools around the world . \\nChristian anarchist Leo Tolstoy , who published the essay `` Education and Culture '' , also established a similar \\tschool with its founding principle being that `` for education to be effective it had to be free . '' \\nIn a similar token , A. S. Neill founded what became the \\tSummerhill School in 1921 , also declaring being free from coercion . \\nAnarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child 's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that \\trationality would lead children to morally good conclusions ; however , there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation . \\nFerrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality , liberty and \\tsocial justice were not possible under capitalism , along with other critiques of government and nationalism . \\nLate 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ( Paul Goodman , Herbert Read , and Colin Ward ) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education , largely focusing on \\tthe need for a system that focuses on children 's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society . \\nContemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that \\tstate education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality . \\nWhile few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day , major tenets of anarchist schools , among them respect for \\tchild autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method , have spread among mainstream educational institutions . \\nJudith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools , namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part \\tof a wider American-Canadian network of schools , the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton , England , and the Paideia School in Spain . \\nThe \\tarts . \\nThe connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism , especially \\tamong artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists , surrealists and others . \\nIn literature , anarchism was mostly associated with \\tthe New Apocalyptics and the neo-romanticism movement . \\nIn music , anarchism has been associated \\twith music scenes such as punk . \\nAnarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist , what separates art from \\ta daily act , is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life . \\nOther anarchists advocated for or used art \\tas a means to achieve anarchist ends . \\nIn his book `` Breaking the Spell : A History of Anarchist Filmmakers , Videotape Guerrillas , and \\tDigital Ninjas '' , Chris Robé claims that `` anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism . '' \\nThroughout the 20th century , many prominent anarchists ( Peter Kropotkin , Emma Goldman , Gustav Landauer and \\tCamillo Berneri ) and publications such as `` Anarchy '' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts . \\nThree overlapping properties made \\tart useful to anarchists . \\nIt could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies , serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect \\tthe anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests . \\nAs it appeals to both emotion and reason , art could \\tappeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect . \\nThe 19th-century neo-impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an \\texample of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism . \\nIn `` Les chataigniers a Osny '' by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro , the \\tblending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nThe most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans can \\tnot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival . \\nPhilosopher Bertrand Russell supported this critique , stating that `` [ p ] eace and war , tariffs , regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs , the \\tpreservation of a just system of distribution : these , among others , are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government . '' \\nAnother common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small \\tenough entities can be self-governing ; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism . \\nPhilosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to \\tviolence and destruction , not only in the pragmatic world , such as at protests , but in the world of ethics as well . \\nSecondly , anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian \\tsince the state can not be defeated practically . \\nThis line of arguments most often calls for \\tpolitical action within the system to reform it . \\nThe third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as \\ta ruling theory that has no ruling theory . \\nAnarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of \\tthe individual , hence no collective action can be taken . \\nLastly , Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective ( all \\ttalk and thoughts ) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong . \\nPhilosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist \\tbooks such as A. John Simmons ' `` Moral Principles and Political Obligations '' . \\nLaw professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue \\tagainst three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious . \\nEdmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience , this \\tdoes not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate . \\nIn `` The Problem of Political Authority '' , Michael Huemer defends philosophical \\tanarchism , claiming that `` political authority is a moral illusion . '' \\nOne of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies \\tand fails to understand the biological inclination to authority . \\nJoseph Raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the \\tbelief that following their instructions will afford more success . \\nRaz believes that this argument is true in \\tfollowing both authorities ' successful and mistaken instruction . \\nAnarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging \\tauthority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable , nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment . \\nAnarchist perception of human nature , rejection of the state , and commitment to social revolution \\thas been criticised by academics as naive , overly simplistic , and unrealistic , respectively . \\nClassical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief \\tthat the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering . \\nFriedrich Engels , considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism , criticised anarchism \\t's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian . \\nAcademic John Molyneux writes in his book `` Anarchism : A Marxist Criticism '' that `` anarchism \\tcan not win '' , believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas . \\nThe Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian \\tcharacter because all individuals should have anarchist views and values . \\nAccording to the Marxist view , that a social idea would follow directly from this \\thuman ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence . \\nMarxists state that this contradiction was \\tresponsible for their inability to act . \\nIn the anarchist vision , the conflict between liberty \\tand equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 13 ''

out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0 , corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation , to 1 , corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation . \\nSurface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity `` J '' e to the \\tirradiance `` E '' e ( flux per unit area ) received by a surface . \\nThe proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself , but \\talso by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface . \\nThese factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location , \\tand time ( see position of the Sun ) . \\nWhile bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( i.e. , for a given position of \\tthe Sun ) , albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period . \\nThe temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from \\tflux measurements ) to daily , monthly , or annual averages . \\nUnless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ) \\t, albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation . \\nDue to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which \\tmost solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0.3 and 3 μm ) . \\nThis spectrum includes visible light ( 0.4–0.7 μm ) , which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( e.g. , \\ttrees absorb most radiation ) , whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( e.g. , snow reflects most radiation ) . \\nAlbedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( e.g. , as part \\tof the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ) . \\nThe average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere , its `` planetary albedo '' , is 30–35 % \\tbecause of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features . \\nThe term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann \\tHeinrich Lambert in his 1760 work `` Photometria '' . \\nTerrestrial \\talbedo . \\nAny albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for \\tfresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances . \\nDeeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo \\tapproaching the zero of a black body . \\nWhen seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as \\tdo most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms . \\nMost land areas are in an \\talbedo range of 0.1 to 0.4 . \\nThe average albedo of \\tEarth is about 0.3 . \\nThis is far higher than for the ocean \\tprimarily because of the contribution of clouds . \\nEarth 's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA 's MODIS instruments \\ton board the Terra and Aqua satellites , and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS . \\nAs the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite , not all directions , a mathematical model \\tis used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance ( e.g. , ) . \\nThese calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( BRDF ) , which describes how the \\treflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle . \\nBDRF can facilitate translations of \\tobservations of reflectance into albedo . \\nEarth 's average surface temperature due to its \\talbedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about . \\nIf Earth were frozen entirely ( and hence be more reflective \\t) , the average temperature of the planet would drop below . \\nIf only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , \\tthe mean temperature of the planet would drop to about . \\nIn contrast , if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called \\tocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost . \\nIn 2021 , scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5 % over two \\tdecades ( 1998–2017 ) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques . \\nThis may have both been co-caused by climate change \\tas well as a substantial increase in global warming . \\nHowever , the link to climate change has not been explored to date \\tand it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend . \\nWhite-sky , black-sky , \\tand blue-sky albedo . \\nFor land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle `` θ '' '' i '' can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and formula_4 \\tbeing the proportion of diffuse illumination , the actual albedo formula_5 ( also called blue-sky albedo ) can then be given as : This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface . \\nExamples of terrestrial \\talbedo effects . \\nIllumination \\t. \\nAlbedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light , \\texcept in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth 's surface at that location ( e.g . \\nthrough melting of \\treflective ice ) . \\nThat said , albedo and \\tillumination both vary by latitude . \\nAlbedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the \\tsubtropics , with a local maximum in the tropics . \\nInsolation \\teffects . \\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ) ; high albedo areas in the Arctic and Antarctic \\tregions are cold due to low insolation , whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation . \\nTropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much \\thotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation . \\nBecause insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas \\tlike the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes . \\nArctic regions notably release more heat back into space \\tthan what they absorb , effectively cooling the Earth . \\nThis has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures , creating regions in \\tthe arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space . \\nThis feedback loop results in \\ta reduced albedo effect . \\nClimate and \\tweather . \\nAlbedo affects climate by determining how \\tmuch radiation a planet absorbs . \\nThe uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land \\t, ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather . \\nAlbedo–temperature \\tfeedback . \\nWhen an area 's albedo changes due \\tto snowfall , a snow–temperature feedback results . \\nA layer of snowfall increases local albedo , \\treflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling . \\nIn principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( e.g. , a warm air mass ) , \\tthe raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow–temperature feedback . \\nHowever , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm \\tair masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting . \\nWhen the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass , soil , or ocean , the effect is reversed : the \\tdarkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating . \\nSnow \\t. \\nSnow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow \\t, to about 0.4 for melting snow , and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow . \\nOver Antarctica snow albedo averages \\ta little more than 0.8 . \\nIf a marginally snow-covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading \\tto more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice–albedo positive feedback ) . \\nJust as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow , the \\talbedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water . \\nSea water absorbs more solar radiation than would \\tthe same surface covered with reflective snow . \\nWhen sea ice melts , either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above , \\tthe snow-covered surface is reduced , and more surface of sea water is exposed , so the rate of energy absorption increases . \\nThe extra absorbed energy heats the sea water , which \\tin turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts . \\nAs with the preceding example of snowmelt , the process of melting \\tof sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback . \\nBoth positive feedback loops have long been \\trecognized as important for global warming . \\nCryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , \\tsometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets . \\nThe dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback , together with the effects of \\tsmall errors in the measurement of albedo , can lead to large errors in energy estimates . \\nBecause of this , in order to reduce the error of energy estimates , it is important to measure the \\talbedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions . \\nSmall-scale \\teffects . \\nAlbedo works on a \\tsmaller scale , too . \\nIn sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing \\tsome control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing . \\nSolar photovoltaic \\teffects . \\nAlbedo can affect the electrical energy \\toutput of solar photovoltaic devices . \\nFor example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology \\tbased on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a-Si : H ) and crystalline silicon ( c-Si ) -based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions . \\nResearch showed impacts of over 10 % for vertically ( 90° ) mounted systems \\t, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts . \\nSpectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains \\tof over 20 % have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation . \\nAn analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials ( both human-made and natural ) provided effective albedo values for simulating \\tthe performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial ( solar farms ) , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications . \\nTrees \\t. \\nBecause forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have \\tsuggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation ) . \\nIn the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction \\tmay be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect . \\nTrees also impact climate in \\textremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration . \\nThe water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , \\tacts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds . \\nScientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate \\timpact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate . \\nIn seasonally snow-covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 % to 50 \\t% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily . \\nDeciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 \\twhereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15 . \\nVariation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high \\tgrowth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy . \\nThe result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be \\treflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy . \\nStudies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect \\tof albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests . \\nThey found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new \\tforests in high latitudes ( e.g. , Siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming . \\nWater \\t. \\nWater reflects light very differently \\tfrom typical terrestrial materials . \\nThe reflectivity of a water surface \\tis calculated using the Fresnel equations . \\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth \\tso the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ) . \\nThe glint of light off water \\tis a commonplace effect of this . \\nAt small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of \\tthe steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle . \\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light \\tsuch as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles ) . \\nHowever , as mentioned above , \\twaviness causes an appreciable reduction . \\nBecause light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to \\thave a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light . \\nNote that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is \\tfoamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities . \\nFresh 'black ' ice \\texhibits Fresnel reflection . \\nSnow on top of this sea \\tice increases the albedo to 0.9 . \\nClouds \\t. \\nCloud albedo has substantial \\tinfluence over atmospheric temperatures . \\nDifferent types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo \\tfrom a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8 . \\n`` On any given day , about half of Earth is covered \\tby clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . \\nClouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they \\tcan also serve as blankets to trap warmth . '' \\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , \\tsuch as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic . \\nA study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under \\tthe burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies . \\nAerosol \\teffects . \\nAerosols ( very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere ) have \\tboth direct and indirect effects on Earth 's radiative balance . \\nThe direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( \\tthe particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain . \\nAs per Spracklen \\tet al . \\nthe effects are : In extremely polluted cities like Delhi , aerosol pollutants \\tinfluence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day . \\nBlack \\tcarbon . \\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate \\tis from black carbon particles . \\nThe size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative \\tforcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2 , with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2 . \\nBlack carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap \\tin the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo . \\nHuman \\tactivities . \\nHuman activities ( e.g. , deforestation , farming , and urbanization \\t) change the albedo of various areas around the globe . \\nAs per Campra et al. , human impacts to `` the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate \\tby altering the Earth ’ s radiative energy balance '' even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites . \\nThe tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in Almería \\t, Spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs . \\nA 2008 study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface \\tarea temperature of the high-albedo area , although changes were localized . \\nA follow-up study found \\tthat `` CO2-eq . \\nemissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land \\ttransformation '' and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change . \\nIt has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo ( commonly being \\t0.01–0.02 lower than adjacent croplands ) , which contributes to global warming . \\nDeliberately increasing albedo in urban areas \\tcan mitigate urban heat island . \\nOuyang et \\tal . \\nestimated that , on a global scale , `` an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas \\twould result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 Gt of CO2 emissions . '' \\nIntentionally enhancing the albedo of the Earth 's surface , along with its daytime thermal emittance , has been proposed as \\ta solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling ( PDRC ) . \\nEfforts toward widespread implementation of PDRCs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to \\thigh values , so long as a thermal emittance of at least 90 % can be achieved . \\nAstronomical \\talbedo . \\nIn astronomy , the term albedo can be defined in several different ways \\t, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved . \\nOptical or \\tvisual albedo . \\nThe albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as \\tasteroids can be used to infer much about their properties . \\nThe study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( `` phase angle '' \\t) , and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . \\nFor small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes , \\tmuch of what we know comes from the study of their albedos . \\nFor example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects , the variation of albedo \\twith phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids . \\nEnceladus , a moon of Saturn , has one of the highest known optical \\talbedos of any body in the Solar System , with an albedo of 0.99 . \\nAnother notable high-albedo body is Eris \\t, with an albedo of 0.96 . \\nMany small objects in the outer Solar System and \\tasteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05 . \\nA typical comet nucleus has \\tan albedo of 0.04 . \\nSuch a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a \\tprimitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds . \\nThe overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14 , but \\tit is strongly directional and non-Lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect . \\nAlthough such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , \\tthey are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies . \\nTwo common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( V-band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination \\tcomes from directly behind the observer ) and the Bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected ) . \\nTheir values can differ significantly , which \\tis a common source of confusion . \\nIn detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters \\twhich semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces . \\nOne of these five parameters is yet another \\ttype of albedo called the single-scattering albedo . \\nIt is used to define scattering \\tof electromagnetic waves on small particles . \\nIt depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ) , the \\tsize of the particle , and the wavelength of the incoming radiation . \\nAn important relationship between an object 's astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is given by : \\tformula_7 where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo , formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers , and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude . \\nRadar \\talbedo . \\nIn planetary radar astronomy , a microwave ( or radar \\t) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target ( e.g . \\nMoon , asteroid \\t, etc . ) \\nand the echo from \\tthe target is measured . \\nIn most instances , the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the \\tsame sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse ( SC ) and the opposite sense ( OC ) . \\nThe echo power is measured in terms of radar cross-section , formula_11 , formula_12 , or formula_13 ( total power , SC + OC ) and is \\tequal to the cross-sectional area of a metallic sphere ( perfect reflector ) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power . \\nThose components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections ( as from a smooth or mirror-like \\tsurface ) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection . \\nIf the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the \\tregolith , there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering . \\nFor most objects in the solar system , the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the ( normalized ) OC radar \\talbedo ( often shortened to radar albedo ) : formula_14 where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius , formula_15 . \\nA smooth metallic sphere \\twould have formula_16 . \\nRadar albedos of \\tSolar System objects . \\nThe values reported for the Moon , Mercury , Mars , Venus , and Comet P/2005 \\tJQ5 are derived from the total ( OC+SC ) radar albedo reported in those references . \\nRelationship to surface \\tbulk density . \\nIn the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections ( formula_17 or so ) , the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient ( aka reflectivity ) and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so ( a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale ) using the following empirical relationships : < /doc

ActresseS '' > ActresseS < /doc > < doc id= '' 290 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=290 '' title= '' A '' > A A , or a , is the first letter and the first vowel of the Latin alphabet , used in the modern English alphabet , the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide . \\nIts name in English is `` a '' \\t( pronounced ) , plural `` aes '' . \\nIt is similar in shape to the Ancient \\tGreek letter alpha , from which it derives . \\nThe uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a \\ttriangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar . \\nThe lowercase version can be written in two \\tforms : the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ . \\nThe latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts \\tintended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type . \\nIn English grammar , `` a '' , and \\tits variant `` an '' , are indefinite articles . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe earliest certain ancestor of `` A '' is aleph ( also written 'aleph ) , the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet , \\twhich consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ) . \\nIn turn , the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in \\tproto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended . \\nWhen the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages , and \\tthat was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha . \\nIn the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages , dating to the eighth century BC , the letter rests upon its side , but in the Greek alphabet of later times \\tit generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set . \\nThe Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization \\tin the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged . \\nThe Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language , and the resulting letter was \\tpreserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including English . \\nTypographic \\tvariants . \\nDuring Roman times , there were many variant \\tforms of the letter `` A '' . \\nFirst was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used \\twhen inscribing on stone or other `` permanent '' media . \\nThere was also a cursive style used for everyday or \\tutilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces . \\nDue to the `` perishable '' nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental \\t, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule . \\nVariants also existed that were intermediate \\tbetween the monumental and cursive styles . \\nThe known variants include the early semi-uncial , \\tthe uncial , and the later semi-uncial . \\nAt the end of the Roman Empire ( 5th century AD ) \\t, several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe . \\nAmong these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy , the Merovingian script in France , the Visigothic \\tscript in Spain , and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain . \\nBy the ninth century , the Caroline script , which was very similar to the present-day form \\t, was the principal form used in book-making , before the advent of the printing press . \\nThis form was derived through \\ta combining of prior forms . \\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the \\ttwo main variants that are known today . \\nThese variants , the `` Italic '' and `` Roman \\t'' forms , were derived from the Caroline Script version . \\nThe Italic form , also called `` script a , '' is used in most current handwriting \\t; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ( `` ɑ '' ) . \\nThis slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter \\ttau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers . \\nThe Roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of \\ta small loop with an arc over it ( `` a '' ) . \\nBoth derive from the majuscule \\t( capital ) form . \\nIn Greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal \\tstroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown . \\nMany fonts then made \\tthe right leg vertical . \\nIn some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting \\tin the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form . \\nGraphic designers refer to the `` Italic '' and `` Roman '' forms \\tas `` single decker a '' and `` double decker a '' respectively . \\nItalic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one \\tpart of a text from the rest ( set in Roman type ) . \\nThere are some other cases aside from italic type where `` script a '' ( `` ɑ '' ) , also called \\tLatin alpha , is used in contrast with Latin `` a '' ( such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet ) . \\nUse in \\twriting systems . \\nEnglish \\t. \\nIn modern English orthography , the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds : The double sequence does not occur in native \\tEnglish words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as `` Aaron '' and `` aardvark '' . \\nHowever , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their \\town sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and . \\nis the third-most-commonly used letter in English ( after and ) and French , \\tthe second most common in Spanish , and the most common in Portuguese . \\nAbout 8.167 % of letters used in English texts tend

\\tnotation : Other uses . \\nIn algebra , the letter `` a '' along with various other letters of the alphabet is \\toften used to denote a variable , with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics . \\nMoreover , in 1637 , René Descartes `` invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x , y , and z , \\tand knowns by a , b , and c '' , and this convention is still often followed , especially in elementary algebra . \\nIn geometry , capital A \\t, B , C etc . \\nare used to denote segments , \\tlines , rays , etc . \\nA capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an \\tangle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A . \\n`` A '' is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : A− , A or A+ , \\tthe best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ; `` A grade '' for clean restaurants ; A-list celebrities , etc . \\nSuch associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter \\tA has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters . \\n`` A '' is used as a prefix on some words , such as asymmetry \\t, to mean `` not '' or `` without '' ( from Greek ) . \\nIn English grammar , `` a '' , and its variant `` an \\t'' , is an indefinite article , used to introduce noun phrases . \\nFinally , the letter A is used to denote size , as in \\ta narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere . \\nCode \\tpoints . \\nThese are the code points for the forms of

Georgia to the east ; Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south ; and Mississippi to the west . \\nAlabama is the 30th largest by area and \\tthe 24th-most populous of the U.S. states . \\nWith a total of of inland waterways , \\tAlabama has among the most of any state . \\nAlabama is nicknamed the `` Yellowhammer State \\t'' , after the state bird . \\nAlabama is also known as the `` Heart of \\tDixie '' and the `` Cotton State '' . \\nThe state tree is the longleaf pine , \\tand the state flower is the camellia . \\nAlabama 's capital is Montgomery , and its \\tlargest city by population and area is Huntsville . \\nIts oldest city is Mobile , founded by French \\tcolonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana . \\nGreater Birmingham is Alabama 's largest \\tmetropolitan area and its economic center . \\nOriginally home to many native tribes , present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning \\tin the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century . \\nThe British won the territory in 1763 until \\tlosing it in the American Revolutionary War . \\nSpain held Mobile as part of \\tSpanish West Florida until 1813 . \\nIn December 1819 , Alabama \\twas recognized as a state . \\nDuring the antebellum period , Alabama was a major producer \\tof cotton , and widely used African American slave labor . \\nIn 1861 , the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States \\tof America , with Montgomery acting as its first capital , and rejoined the Union in 1868 . \\nFollowing the American Civil War , Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship , in part due \\tto agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state 's economy . \\nSimilar to other former slave states , Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against \\tAfrican Americans and also Alabama 's French Creole population from the late 19th century up until the 1960s . \\nIn the early 20th century , despite the growth of major industries and urban \\tcenters , white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid-20th century . \\nDuring this time , urban interests \\tand African Americans were markedly under-represented . \\nHigh-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a \\tmajor focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s . \\nDuring and after World War II , Alabama grew \\tas the state 's economy diversified with new industries . \\nNASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama 's economic \\tgrowth in the mid-to-late 20th century , by developing an aerospace industry . \\nAlabama 's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive , finance , tourism , \\tmanufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology . \\nThe state 's geography is diverse , with the north dominated by the mountainous \\tTennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay , a historically significant port . \\nPolitically , as part of the Deep South , Alabama is predominantly \\ta conservative state , and is known for its Southern culture . \\nWithin Alabama , American football , particularly at the college level at schools such as the University of Alabama , Auburn University , Alabama A & amp ; M \\tUniversity , Alabama State University , Troy University , the University of South Alabama , and Jacksonville State University , plays a major part of the state 's culture . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people , a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose \\tmembers lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river . \\nIn the Alabama language , the word for a person of Alabama lineage is \\t( or variously or in different dialects ; the plural form is ) . \\nThe word 's spelling varies \\tsignificantly among historical sources . \\nThe first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 : Garcilaso de la Vega used , while \\tthe Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote `` Alibamu '' and `` Limamu '' , respectively , in transliterations of the term . \\nAs early as 1702 , the French called the tribe \\tthe , with French maps identifying the river as . \\nOther spellings of the name have included `` Alibamu '' , `` Alabamo '' , `` Albama '' , \\t`` Alebamon '' , `` Alibama '' , `` Alibamou '' , `` Alabamu '' , `` Allibamou '' . \\nand possibly `` \\tAlabahmu '' . \\nThe use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in \\tthe U.S. ; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin . \\nSources disagree on the \\tword 's meaning . \\nSome scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw ( meaning 'plants ' or 'weeds ' ) \\tand ( meaning 'to cut ' , 'to trim ' , or 'to gather ' ) . \\nThe meaning may have been 'clearers of the thicket ' or 'herb gatherers \\t' , referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants . \\nThe state has numerous place \\tnames of Native American origin . \\nHowever , there are no correspondingly \\tsimilar words in the Alabama language . \\nAn 1842 article in the `` Jacksonville Republican \\t'' proposed it meant 'Here We Rest ' . \\nThis notion was popularized in the 1850s \\tthrough the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek . \\nExperts in the Muskogean languages have not found \\tany evidence to support such a translation . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPre-European \\tsettlement . \\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for \\tthousands of years before the advent of European colonization . \\nTrade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the \\tBurial Mound Period ( 1000BCE700CE ) and continued until European contact . \\nThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE , with one \\tof its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville , Alabama . \\nThis is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era , after \\tCahokia in present-day Illinois , which was the center of the culture . \\nAnalysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars \\t' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex ( SECC ) . \\nContrary to popular belief , the SECC appears to have \\tno direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently . \\nThe Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples \\t; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood . \\nAmong the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee , an \\tIroquoian language people ; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama ( `` Alibamu '' ) , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek , and Koasati . \\nWhile part of the same large language family , \\tthe Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages . \\nEuropean \\tsettlement . \\nThe Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during \\ttheir exploration of North America in the 16th century . \\nThe expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila \\tand other parts of the state in 1540 . \\nMore than 160 years later , the French founded the \\tregion 's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702 . \\nThe city was moved to the \\tcurrent site of Mobile in 1711 . \\nThis area was claimed by the French from \\t1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane . \\nAfter the French lost to the British in the Seven Years ' War \\t, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783 . \\nAfter the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War , \\tthe territory was divided between the United States and Spain . \\nThe latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of \\tthe Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13 , 1813 . \\nThomas Bassett , a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era \\t, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile . \\nHe settled in the Tombigbee \\tDistrict during the early 1770s . \\nThe district 's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and \\tincluded portions of what is today southern Clarke County , northernmost Mobile County , and most of Washington County . \\nWhat is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783 , part of \\tthe independent Republic of West Florida in 1810 , and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812 . \\nMost of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was \\tknown as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period . \\nIt was claimed by the Province \\tof Georgia from 1767 onwards . \\nFollowing the Revolutionary War , it remained a \\tpart of Georgia , although heavily disputed . \\nWith the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands , what is now the \\tlower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798 . \\nThe Yazoo lands were added to the territory \\tin 1804 , following the Yazoo land scandal . \\nSpain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the \\tcoastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819 . \\n19th \\tcentury . \\nBefore Mississippi 's admission to statehood on December 10 , 1817 , the more \\tsparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory . \\nThe United States Congress created the Alabama \\tTerritory on March 3 , 1817 . \\nSt. Stephens , now abandoned , served as \\tthe territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 . \\nAlabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14 , 1819 , \\twith Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention . \\nFrom July5 to August 2 , 1819 , \\tdelegates met to prepare the new state constitution . \\nHuntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 , when \\tthe seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County . \\nCahaba , now a ghost town , was the \\tfirst permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 . \\nThe Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union , with settlers \\tand land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation . \\nPart of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s , \\tits constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men . \\nSoutheastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves \\twith them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded . \\nThe economy of the central Black Belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) \\twas built around large cotton plantations whose owners ' wealth grew mainly from slave labor . \\nThe area also drew many poor , \\tdisenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers . \\nAlabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810 \\t, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830 . \\nMost Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few \\tyears of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830 . \\nFrom 1826 to 1846 , Tuscaloosa \\tserved as Alabama 's capital . \\nOn January 30 , 1846 , the Alabama legislature announced it \\thad voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery . \\nThe first legislative session in the \\tnew capital met in December 1847 . \\nA new capitol building was erected under the \\tdirection of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia . \\nThe first structure burned down in 1849 , but \\twas rebuilt on the same site in 1851 . \\nThis second capitol building in Montgomery \\tremains to the present day . \\nIt was designed by Barachias \\tHolt of Exeter , Maine . \\nCivil War \\tand Reconstruction . \\nBy 1860 , the population had increased to 964,201 people , of which nearly half \\t, 435,080 , were enslaved African Americans , and 2,690 were free people of color . \\nOn January 11 , 1861 , Alabama \\tdeclared its secession from the Union . \\nAfter remaining an independent republic for a few days \\t, it joined the Confederate States of America . \\nThe Confederacy 's capital \\twas initially at Montgomery . \\nAlabama was heavily involved in \\tthe American Civil War . \\nAlthough comparatively few battles were fought in the state , \\tAlabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort . \\nA company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville , Alabama , \\tjoined Nathan Bedford Forrest 's battalion in Hopkinsville , Kentucky . \\nThe company wore new uniforms with yellow trim \\ton the sleeves , collar and coattails . \\nThis led to them being greeted with `` Yellowhammer '' , and the \\tname later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army . \\nAlabama 's slaves were freed by \\tthe 13th Amendment in 1865 . \\nAlabama was under military rule from the end of the war in \\tMay 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868 . \\nFrom 1867 to 1874 , with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and \\tfreedmen enfranchised , many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state . \\nAlabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen \\t: Jeremiah Haralson , Benjamin S. Turner , and James T. Rapier . \\nFollowing the war , the state remained chiefly \\tagricultural , with an economy tied to cotton . \\nDuring Reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which \\tcreated the state 's first public school system and expanded women 's rights . \\nLegislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although \\tthese were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation . \\nOrganized insurgent , resistance groups tried \\tto suppress the freedmen and Republicans . \\nBesides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan , these included the Pale Faces , \\tKnights of the White Camellia , Red Shirts , and the White League . \\nReconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874 , when the Democrats regained control of the \\tlegislature and governor 's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence . \\nThey wrote another constitution in 1875 , and the legislature passed the Blaine \\tAmendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools . \\nThe same year , legislation was approved \\tthat called for racially segregated schools . \\nRailroad passenger cars were \\tsegregated in 1891 . \\n20th \\tcentury . \\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all African Americans and \\tNative Americans , and tens of thousands of poor European Americans , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test . \\nThe 1901 constitution required racial \\tsegregation of public schools . \\nBy 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in \\tAlabama , although at least 74,000 were literate . \\nThis compared to more than 181,000 African \\tAmericans eligible to vote in 1900 . \\nThe numbers dropped even \\tmore in later decades . \\nThe state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s : jails were segregated in 1911 \\t; hospitals in 1915 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 1928 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 . \\nWhile the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the \\tnew restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax . \\nBy 1941 , whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised \\tby these laws : 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans . \\nNearly all Blacks had lost \\tthe ability to vote . \\nDespite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions , \\tthe state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement . \\nThe exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of \\tfederal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens . \\nThe rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised \\tAfrican Americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes . \\nPartially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South , \\tthe Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools . \\nIn Alabama , these schools were designed , and the construction partially \\tfinanced with Rosenwald funds , which paid one-third of the construction costs . \\nThe fund required the local community and state \\tto raise matching funds to pay the rest . \\nBlack residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply \\tmatching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas . \\nThey often donated land \\tand labor as well . \\nBeginning in 1913 , the first 80 Rosenwald Schools \\twere built in Alabama for African American children . \\nA total of 387 schools , seven teachers ' houses , \\tand several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state . \\nSeveral of the surviving school buildings in the state are \\tnow listed on the National Register of Historic Places . \\nContinued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural \\tAlabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South . \\nReflecting this emigration , the population growth rate in Alabama ( see `` historical \\tpopulations '' table below ) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 . \\nAt the same time , many rural people migrated to \\tthe city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs . \\nBirmingham experienced such rapid growth it was \\tcalled the `` Magic City '' . \\nBy 1920 , Birmingham was the \\t36th-largest city in the United States . \\nHeavy industry and mining were \\tthe basis of its economy . \\nIts residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature , which refused to redistrict after \\teach decennial census according to population changes , as it was required by the state constitution . \\nThis did not change until the late \\t1960s following a lawsuit and court order . \\nIndustrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level \\tof prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war . \\nRural workers poured into the largest cities in the state \\tfor better jobs and a higher standard of living . \\nOne example of this massive influx \\tof workers occurred in Mobile . \\nBetween 1940 and 1943 , more than 89,000 people \\tmoved into the city to work for war-related industries . \\nCotton and other cash crops faded in importance as \\tthe state developed a manufacturing and service base . \\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 , the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and \\tSenate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses . \\nThey held on to old representation to maintain \\tpolitical and economic power in agricultural areas . \\nOne result was that Jefferson County , containing Birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than \\tone-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services . \\nUrban interests were consistently \\tunderrepresented in the legislature . \\nA 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , `` a minority of about 25 \\t% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature . '' \\nIn the United States Supreme Court cases of `` Baker v. Carr '' ( 1962 ) and `` Reynolds v. Sims '' ( 1964 ) , the court ruled that the principle of \\t`` one man , one vote '' needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures , and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties . \\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and \\tsegregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges . \\nIn 1954 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in `` Brown v. Board of Education \\t'' that public schools had to be desegregated , but Alabama was slow to comply . \\nDuring the 1960s , under Governor George Wallace , \\tAlabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation . \\nThe civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama , including the Montgomery bus boycott \\t( 1955–1956 ) , Freedom Rides in 1961 , and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches . \\nThese contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act \\tof 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress . \\nLegal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but \\tJim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court . \\nAccording to `` The New York Times '' , by 2017 , many of Alabama \\t's African Americans were living in Alabama 's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery . \\nAlso , the Black Belt region across central Alabama `` \\tis home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American . \\nThese counties include Dallas , Lowndes \\t, Marengo and Perry . '' \\nIn 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the \\tlegislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census . \\nThis benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all \\tin the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years . \\nOther changes were made to implement \\trepresentative state house and senate districts . \\nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century \\tand has used new types of voting to increase representation . \\nIn the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , `` Dillard v. Crenshaw County '' , challenged \\tthe at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards . \\nAt-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a \\tcounty , as the majority tended to take all seats . \\nDespite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state , they \\thad been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions . \\nAs part of settlement of this case , five Alabama cities and counties , including Chilton \\tCounty , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions . \\nThis has resulted in more \\tproportional representation for voters . \\nIn another form of proportional representation , 23 jurisdictions \\tuse limited voting , as in Conecuh County . \\nIn 1982 , limited voting was \\tfirst tested in Conecuh County . \\nTogether use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being \\telected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens . \\nBeginning in the 1960s , the state 's economy shifted away from its \\ttraditional lumber , steel , and textile industries because of increased foreign competition . \\nSteel jobs , for instance , declined from \\t46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011 . \\nHowever , the state , particularly Huntsville , benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight \\tCenter in 1960 , a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle . \\nTechnology and manufacturing industries , such as automobile assembly , replaced some the state 's older industries in the late twentieth century \\t, but the state 's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area , such as Georgia and Florida . \\n21st \\tcentury . \\nIn 2001 , Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed \\ta statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery . \\nIn 2002 , the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed , but Moore refused to follow \\tthe court order , which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument . \\nThe monument was removed \\tin August 2003 . \\nA few natural disasters have occurred in \\tthe state in the twenty-first century . \\nIn 2004 , Hurricane Ivan , a category 3 storm upon landfall \\t, struck the state and caused over $ 18 billion of damage . \\nIt was among the most destructive storms to \\tstrike the state in its modern history . \\nA super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in \\tApril 2011 and killed 238 people , devastating many communities . \\nGeography \\t. \\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area : 3.2 % of the area is water , \\tmaking Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water , also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States . \\nAbout three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain , a \\tgentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico . \\nThe North Alabama region is mostly mountainous , with the Tennessee River cutting a large \\tvalley and creating numerous creeks , streams , rivers , mountains , and lakes . \\nAlabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north , Georgia to \\tthe east , Florida to the south , and Mississippi to the west . \\nAlabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico , \\tin the extreme southern edge of the state . \\nThe state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay \\tto more than in the northeast , to Mount Cheaha at . \\nAlabama 's land consists of of forest or 67 \\t% of the state 's total land area . \\nSuburban Baldwin County , along the Gulf Coast , is the largest \\tcounty in the state in both land area and water area . \\nAreas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City ; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort \\tPayne ; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport ; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee ; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee . \\nAdditionally , Alabama has four National Forests : Conecuh \\t, Talladega , Tuskegee , and William B. Bankhead . \\nAlabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway , the Selma To Montgomery \\tNational Historic Trail , and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail . \\nNotable natural wonders include : the `` Natural Bridge '' rock , the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies , located just south of Haleyville ; Cathedral Caverns in Marshall County , named for its cathedral-like appearance , features one of the largest cave entrances and stalagmites in the world ; Ecor Rouge in Fairhope , the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico ; DeSoto Caverns in Childersburg , the first officially recorded cave in the United States ; Noccalula Falls in Gadsden features a 90-foot waterfall ; Dismals Canyon near \\tPhil Campbell , home to two waterfalls , six natural bridges and allegedly served as a hideout for legendary outlaw Jesse James ; Stephens Gap Cave in Jackson County boasts a 143-foot pit , two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America ; Little River Canyon near Fort Payne , one of the nation 's longest mountaintop rivers ; Rickwood Caverns near Warrior features an underground pool , blind cave fish and 260-million-year-old limestone formations ; and the Walls of Jericho canyon on the Alabama-Tennessee state line . \\nA -wide meteorite impact crater is located in \\tElmore County , just north of Montgomery . \\nThis is the Wetumpka crater , the site \\tof `` Alabama 's greatest natural disaster '' . \\nA -wide meteorite hit the area \\tabout 80 million years ago . \\nThe hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock , with the area labeled the Wetumpka \\tcrater or astrobleme ( `` star-wound '' ) because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface . \\nIn 2002 , Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published \\tevidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth . \\nClimate \\t. \\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical ( `` \\tCfa '' ) under the Koppen Climate Classification . \\nThe average annual temperature is \\t64°F ( 18°C ) . \\nTemperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico , while \\tthe northern parts of the state , especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast , tend to be slightly cooler . \\nGenerally , Alabama has very hot summers and \\tmild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year . \\nAlabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing \\tseason of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state . \\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S. , with high \\ttemperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state . \\nAlabama is also prone to \\ttropical storms and hurricanes . \\nAreas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of \\tthe storms , which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken . \\nSouth Alabama reports \\tmany thunderstorms . \\nThe Gulf Coast , around Mobile Bay , averages between \\t70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported . \\nThis activity decreases somewhat further north in the state , but even the \\tfar north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year . \\nOccasionally , thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail ; the central \\tand northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm . \\nAlabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and \\ttenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita . \\nAlabama , along with Oklahoma and Iowa , has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state , \\taccording to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1 , 1950 , to June 2013 . \\nSeveral long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting \\tmore tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state . \\nThe state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak \\tand was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak . \\nThe 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record \\tamount of tornadoes in the state . \\nThe tally \\treached 62 . \\nThe peak season for tornadoes varies from the \\tnorthern to southern parts of the state . \\nAlabama is one of the few places in the world that has a \\tsecondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring . \\nThe northern part—along the Tennessee \\tRiver Valley—is most vulnerable . \\nThe area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to \\tas Dixie Alley , as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains . \\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama , as they are throughout most of the Southeastern \\tUnited States , with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham . \\nAlthough snow is a rare event in much of Alabama , areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive \\ta dusting of snow a few times every winter , with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years . \\nHistoric snowfall events include New Year 's Eve 1963 \\tsnowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century . \\nThe annual average snowfall for the \\tBirmingham area is per year . \\nIn the southern Gulf coast , snowfall is less \\tfrequent , sometimes going several years without any snowfall . \\nAlabama 's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5 \\t, 1925 , in the unincorporated community of Centerville . \\nThe record low of occurred on January \\t30 , 1966 , in New Market . \\nFlora and \\tfauna . \\nAlabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley , Appalachian Plateau , and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north \\tto the Piedmont , Canebrake , and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south . \\nThe state is usually ranked among the top \\tin nation for its range of overall biodiversity . \\nAlabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of \\tpine forest , which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state . \\nIt currently ranks fifth in the nation \\tfor the diversity of its flora . \\nIt is home to nearly 4,000 \\tpteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species . \\nIndigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species , 93 reptile species , 73 amphibian species , roughly 307 \\tnative freshwater fish species , and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state . \\nInvertebrates include 97 crayfish species \\tand 383 mollusk species . \\n113 of these mollusk species have \\tnever been collected outside the state . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nAccording to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279 on April 1 , \\t2020 , which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12 % , since the 2010 census . \\nThis includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 ( 502,457 births minus \\t381,403 deaths ) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state . \\nImmigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people \\t, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people . \\nThe state had 108,000 foreign-born ( 2.4 % of the state population ) \\t, of which an estimated 22.2 % were undocumented ( 24,000 ) . \\nAlabama has the 5th highest African American population among \\tUS states at 25.8 % as of 2020 . \\nThe center of population of Alabama is located in \\tChilton County , outside the town of Jemison . \\nAncestry \\t. \\nThose citing `` American '' ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction , however most English Americans identify simply as having \\tAmerican ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long , in many cases since the early 1600s . \\nDemographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23 % of people in Alabama are \\tof predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher . \\nIn the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total \\tstate population of 2,824,719 making them 41 % of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group . \\nIn 2011 , 46.6 % of Alabama \\t's population younger than age1 were minorities . \\nThe largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are American ( 13.4 % ) , Irish ( 10.5 % ) , English ( \\t10.2 % ) , German ( 7.9 % ) , and Scots-Irish ( 2.5 % ) based on 2006-2008 Census data . \\nThe Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution , \\tand many settled in the South , later moving into the Deep South as it was developed . \\nIn 1984 , under the Davis–Strong Act , the \\tstate legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission . \\nNative American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding \\trecognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination . \\nGiven the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation , the Native American peoples , \\twho have sometimes been of mixed race , have insisted on having their cultural identification respected . \\nIn the past , their self-identification was often overlooked as the state \\ttried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black . \\nThe state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state \\t, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast . \\nThese are \\tthe following . \\nThe state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state , including the \\tdesignation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day . \\nLanguage \\t. \\nMost Alabama residents ( 95.1 % of those five and older ) spoke only \\tEnglish at home in 2010 , a minor decrease from 96.1 % in 2000 . \\nAlabama English is predominantly Southern , and is related to South \\tMidland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee . \\nIn the major Southern speech region , there is the decreasing loss of the final \\t`` r '' , for example the `` boyd '' pronunciation of `` bird '' . \\nIn the northern third of the state , there is a South Midland `` arm '' \\tand `` barb '' rhyming with `` form '' and `` orb '' , respectively . \\nUnique words in Alabama English include : redworm ( earthworm ) , peckerwood ( woodpecker ) , snake doctor and snake feeder ( dragonfly ) , \\ttow sack ( burlap bag ) , plum peach ( clingstone ) , French harp ( harmonica ) , and dog irons ( andirons ) . \\nReligion \\t. \\nIn the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey , 86 % of Alabama respondents reported their religion \\tas Christian , including 6 % Catholic , with 11 % as having no religion . \\nThe composition of other traditions is 0.5 % Mormon , 0.5 % Jewish \\t, 0.5 % Muslim , 0.5 % Buddhist , and 0.5 % Hindu . \\nAlabama is located in the middle of the Bible \\tBelt , a region of numerous Protestant Christians . \\nAlabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the \\tUnited States , with about 58 % of the population attending church regularly . \\nA majority of people in the \\tstate identify as Evangelical Protestant . \\n, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist \\tConvention , The United Methodist Church , and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant . \\nIn Alabama , the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121 ; this is followed by the \\tUnited Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents , non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents , and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents . \\nMany Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of \\tthe early 19th century , when preachers proselytized across the South . \\nThe Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members , \\tthe Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members . \\nThe Presbyterian churches , strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants , had a combined membership around 75,000 ( PCA—28,009 members in 108 congregations , PC ( USA ) —26,247 members in \\t147 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church—6,000 members in 59 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations ) . \\nIn a 2007 survey , nearly 70 % of \\trespondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels . \\nOf those who indicated a religious preference , 59 % said they possessed \\ta `` full understanding '' of their faith and needed no further learning . \\nIn a 2007 poll , 92 % of Alabamians reported \\thaving at least some confidence in churches in the state . \\nAlthough in much smaller numbers , many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well , \\tincluding Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism , Sikhism , the Baháʼí Faith , and Unitarian Universalism . \\nJews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763 , during \\tthe colonial era of Mobile , when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London . \\nThe oldest Jewish congregation in the state \\tis Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile . \\nIt was formally recognized by the state \\tlegislature on January 25 , 1844 . \\nLater immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \\ttended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe . \\nJewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox , four \\tConservative , ten Reform , and one Humanistic synagogue . \\nMuslims have been increasing in Alabama , with 31 \\tmosques built by 2011 , many by African-American converts . \\nSeveral Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants , the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham , the \\tHindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham , the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw , and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa . \\nThere are six Dharma centers \\tand organizations for Theravada Buddhists . \\nMost monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern \\tMobile County , near Bayou La Batre . \\nThis area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia \\t, Laos , and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter . \\nThe four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre , \\tinclude Chua Chanh Giac , Wat Buddharaksa , and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan . \\nThe first community of adherents of the Baháʼí Faith in Alabama was founded \\tin 1896 by Paul K. Dealy , who moved from Chicago to Fairhope . \\nBaháʼí centers in Alabama exist in \\tBirmingham , Huntsville , and Florence . \\nHealth \\t. \\nIn 2018 , life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years , below the national \\taverage of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country . \\nFactors that can cause lower life expectancy are \\tmaternal mortality , suicide , and gun crimes . \\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem , with most counties \\thaving more than 29 % of adults obese , except for ten which had a rate between 26 % and 29 % . \\nResidents of the state , along with those in five other states , \\twere least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time . \\nAlabama , and the southeastern U.S. in general , has one of the highest \\tincidences of adult onset diabetes in the country , exceeding 10 % of adults . \\nOn May 14 , 2019 , Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act , banning abortion at any stage \\tof pregnancy unless there is a `` serious health risk '' , with no exceptions for rape and incest . \\nThe law subjects doctors who perform abortions \\twith 10 to 99 years imprisonment . \\nThe law was originally supposed to take effect the following November , but on October 29 , 2019 , U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson \\tblocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case `` Roe v. Wade '' . \\nOn June 24 , 2022 , after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned `` Roe v. Wade '' in `` Dobbs v. \\tJackson Women 's Health Organization '' , Judge Thompson lifted the injunction , allowing the law to go into effect . \\nEconomy \\t. \\nThe state has invested in aerospace , education , health care , banking , and \\tvarious heavy industries , including automobile manufacturing , mineral extraction , steel production and fabrication . \\nBy 2006 , crop and animal production \\tin Alabama was valued at $ 1.5billion . \\nIn contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century , this \\twas only about one percent of the state 's gross domestic product . \\nThe number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s , \\tas land has been sold to developers , timber companies , and large farming conglomerates . \\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations ; 71,750 in business and financial operations ; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation ; 44,200 in architecture and engineering ; 12,410 in life , physical , and social sciences ; 32,260 in community and social services ; 12,770 in legal occupations ; 116,250 in education , training , and library services ; 27,840 in art , design and media occupations ; 121,110 in healthcare ; 44,750 in fire fighting , law \\tenforcement , and security ; 154,040 in food preparation and serving ; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance ; 53,230 in personal care and services ; 244,510 in sales ; 338,760 in office and administration support ; 20,510 in farming , fishing , and forestry ; 120,155 in construction and mining , gas , and oil extraction ; 106,280 in installation , maintenance , and repair ; 224,110 in production ; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving . \\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis , the 2008 total \\tgross state product was $ 170billion , or $ 29,411 per capita . \\nAlabama 's 2012 GDP increased 1.2 \\t% from the previous year . \\nThe single largest increase came \\tin the area of information . \\nIn 2010 , per capita income \\tfor the state was $ 22,984 . \\nThe state 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate \\twas 5.8 % in April 2015 . \\nThis compared to a nationwide seasonally \\tadjusted rate of 5.4 % . \\nAlabama has no minimum wage and in February \\t2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one . \\n( A Birmingham city ordinance would have \\traised theirs to $ 10.10 . ) \\n, Alabama has the sixth highest poverty \\trate among states in the U.S . \\nIn 2017 , United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed \\tenvironmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world . \\nLargest \\temployers . \\nThe five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 \\twere : The next twenty largest employers , , included : Agriculture . \\nAlabama 's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs , cattle , fish , plant nursery items , peanuts \\t, cotton , grains such as corn and sorghum , vegetables , milk , soybeans , and peaches . \\nAlthough known as `` The Cotton State '' , Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton \\tproduction , according to various reports , with Texas , Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three . \\nAquaculture \\t. \\nAquaculture is a large part \\tof the economy of Alabama . \\nAlabamians began to practice aquaculture \\tin the early 1960s . \\nU.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th \\tmost popular seafood product in America . \\nBy 2008 , approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by \\tthe catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish . \\nIn 2020 , Alabama produced of \\tthe United States ' farm-raised catfish . \\nThe total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $ 307 \\tmillion but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442 . \\nFrom the early 2000s to 2020 , the Alabamian catfish industry has declined \\tfrom 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors . \\nReasons for this decline include increased feed prices , catfish alternatives , \\tCOVID-19 's impact on restaurant sales , disease , and fish size . \\nIndustry \\t. \\nAlabama 's industrial outputs include iron and steel products ( including cast-iron and steel pipe ) ; paper , lumber \\t, and wood products ; mining ( mostly coal ) ; plastic products ; cars and trucks ; and apparel . \\nIn addition , Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products , mostly in the Huntsville area , the location of \\tNASA 's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command , headquartered at Redstone Arsenal . \\nA great deal of Alabama 's economic growth since the 1990s \\thas been due to the state 's expanding automotive manufacturing industry . \\nLocated in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama , Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama , Mercedes-Benz \\tU.S. International , and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama , as well as their various suppliers . \\nSince 1993 , the automobile industry has generated \\tmore than 67,800 new jobs in the state . \\nAlabama currently ranks 4th in \\tthe nation for vehicle exports . \\nAutomakers accounted for approximately a third of the \\tindustrial expansion in the state in 2012 . \\nThe eight models produced at the state 's auto \\tfactories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012 . \\nThe strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car , \\tthe Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck . \\nSteel producers Outokumpu , Nucor , SSAB , ThyssenKrupp , and U.S. \\tSteel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people . \\nIn May 2007 , German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile \\tCounty for a 4.65billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility . \\nThyssenKrupp 's stainless steel division , Inoxum , including the stainless portion of the \\tCalvert plant , was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012 . \\nThe remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted \\tby ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $ 1.6billion in March 2013 . \\nCompanhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert , plus \\ta majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil , for $ 3.8billion . \\nIn July 2013 , the plant was \\tsold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel . \\nThe Hunt Refining Company , a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated , \\tInc. , is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there . \\nThe company also operates terminals in \\tMobile , Melvin , and Moundville . \\nJVC America , Inc. operates an optical \\tdisc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa . \\nThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large \\tplant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people . \\nIt has been in \\toperation since 1929 . \\nConstruction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by \\tAirbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2 , 2012 . \\nThe plans include a $ 600million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex \\tfor the assembly of the A319 , A320 and A321 aircraft . \\nConstruction began in 2013 , with plans for it to become operable \\tby 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017 . \\nThe assembly plant is the company 's first \\tfactory to be built within the United States . \\nIt was announced on February 1 , 2013 , that Airbus \\thad hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility . \\nThe factory officially opened on September 14 , 2015 , covering \\tone million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland . \\nTourism and \\tentertainment . \\nAccording to Business Insider , Alabama ranked 14th \\tin most popular states to visit in 2014 . \\nAn estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $ 14.3 billion , providing directly \\tor indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state , which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $ 589 million . \\nThe state is home to various attractions , natural features , parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe , notably the annual Hangout Music Festival , held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores ;

as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented . \\nIt had not changed legislative districts to \\treflect the decennial censuses , either . \\nIn `` Reynolds v. Sims '' ( 1964 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of `` one man , one vote '' , \\truling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented . ) \\nFurther , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned \\tby population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems . \\nAt that time , Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting \\t, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts . \\nThis had caused decades of \\tunderinvestment in such areas . \\nFor instance , Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state \\tbudget , but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding . \\nThrough the legislative delegations , the Alabama \\tlegislature kept control of county governments . \\nThe executive branch is responsible for \\tthe execution and oversight of laws . \\nIt is headed by \\tthe governor of Alabama . \\nOther members of the executive branch include the cabinet , the lieutenant governor of Alabama , the Attorney General of \\tAlabama , the Alabama Secretary of State , the Alabama State Treasurer , and the State Auditor of Alabama . \\nThe current governor is \\tRepublican Kay Ivey . \\nThe members of the Legislature take \\toffice immediately after the November elections . \\nStatewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney \\tgeneral , and other constitutional officers , take office the following January . \\nThe judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama \\tand applying the law in state criminal and civil cases . \\nThe state 's highest court is \\tthe Supreme Court of Alabama . \\nAlabama uses partisan elections \\tto select judges . \\nSince the 1980s judicial campaigns \\thave become increasingly politicized . \\nThe current chief justice of the Alabama \\tSupreme Court is Republican Tom Parker . \\nAll sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme \\tCourt are members of the Republican Party . \\nThere are two intermediate appellate courts , the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals , and four trial \\tcourts : the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ) , and the district , probate , and municipal courts . \\nSome critics believe the election of judges has \\tcontributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions . \\nAlabama has the highest per capita \\tdeath penalty rate in the country . \\nIn some years , it imposes more death sentences than does \\tTexas , a state which has a population five times larger . \\nHowever , executions per capita \\tare significantly higher in Texas . \\nSome of its cases have been highly controversial ; the U.S. \\tSupreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases . \\nIt was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death \\tsentence ; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries . \\nThis judicial authority was \\tremoved in April 2017 . \\nAlabama is one of the very few states that \\tdoes not allow the creation of state lotteries . \\nTaxes \\t. \\nTaxes are collected by the \\tAlabama Department of Revenue . \\nAlabama levies a 2 % , 4 % , or5 % personal \\tincome tax , depending on the amount earned and filing status . \\nTaxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax , even if taking the \\tstandard deduction ; those who itemize can also deduct FICA ( the Social Security and Medicare tax ) . \\nThe state 's general sales \\ttax rate is 4 % . \\nSales tax rates for cities and \\tcounties are also added to purchases . \\nFor example , the total sales tax rate in Mobile County , Alabama is 10 % and there is an additional restaurant tax \\tof 1 % , which means a diner in Mobile County , Alabama would pay an 11 % tax on a meal . \\nIn 2020 , sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted \\tfor 38 % of all state and local revenue . \\nOnly Alabama , Mississippi , and South Dakota tax \\tgroceries at the full state sales tax rate . \\nThe corporate income tax rate \\tin Alabama is 6.5 % . \\nThe overall federal , state , and local tax burden in Alabama \\tranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country . \\nProperty taxes of .40 % of assessed value per year \\t, are the second-lowest in the U.S. , after Hawaii . \\nThe current state constitution requires a \\tvoter referendum to raise property taxes . \\nCounty and \\tlocal governments . \\nAlabama has \\t67 counties . \\nEach county has its own elected legislative \\tbranch , usually called the county commission . \\nIt also has limited executive \\tauthority in the county . \\nBecause of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( Jefferson \\t, Lee , Mobile , Madison , Montgomery , Shelby , and Tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule . \\nInstead , most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state \\tlegislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning . \\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional \\tamendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission . \\nLegislative delegations retain certain \\tpowers over each county . \\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions in `` Baker v. Carr '' ( 1964 ) required that both houses have districts established on the \\tbasis of population , and redistricted after each census , to implement the principle of `` one man , one vote '' . \\nBefore that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading \\tto under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties . \\nThe rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , \\taffected politics well into the 20th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas . \\n`` The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation \\tof local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution . \\nAlabama 's constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one-third of \\tthe amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city . \\nA significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , \\ttaking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance . '' \\nAlabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning the \\tstate government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol . \\nThe Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale \\tand distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state . \\nA total of 25 of the 67 counties are `` dry counties '' which ban the \\tsale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War , Alabama was occupied by \\tfederal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope . \\nIn 1874 , the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government \\tfrom the Republicans , in part by suppressing the black vote through violence , fraud , and intimidation . \\nAfter 1890 , a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and \\tdisenfranchise African American residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution . \\nProvisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted \\tin excluding many poor Whites . \\nBy 1941 more Whites than Blacks had \\tbeen disenfranchised : 600,000 to 520,000 . \\nThe total effects were greater on the black community , as almost all its \\tcitizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law . \\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s , the state did not redraw election districts as \\tpopulation grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas . \\nAs counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly \\tthree-quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation . \\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement \\t, when whites bureaucratically , and at times violently , resisted protests for electoral and social reform . \\nGovernor George Wallace , the state 's only four-term governor \\t, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation . \\nOnly after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of \\t1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights . \\nIn many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large \\telectoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections . \\nSome changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to \\testablish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards . \\nIn 2007 , the Alabama Legislature passed , and Republican governor Bob Riley signed \\ta resolution expressing `` profound regret '' over slavery and its lingering impact . \\nIn a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the Alabama \\tState Capitol , which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America . \\nIn 2010 , Republicans won control of both houses of \\tthe legislature for the first time in 136 years . \\n, there are a total of 3,589,839 registered voters , with \\t3,518,285 active , and the others inactive in the state . \\nElections \\t. \\nIn a 2020 study , Alabama was ranked as \\tthe 12th most difficult state for citizens to vote . \\nState \\telections . \\nWith the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901 , the state became part of the `` Solid South '' , \\ta system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state . \\nFor nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the \\tDemocratic Party primary , with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election . \\nSince the mid- to late 20th century , however \\t, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party . \\nIn Alabama , majority-white districts are now expected to regularly \\telect Republican candidates to federal , state and local office . \\nMembers of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and \\tall ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office . \\nUntil 1994 , no Republicans held \\tany of the court seats . \\nIn that general election , the then-incumbent chief justice , Ernest C. Hornsby , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to \\tRepublican Perry O. Hooper Sr. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court . \\nThe Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August \\t2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench . \\nIn the early 21st century , Republicans hold all \\tseven of the statewide elected executive branch offices . \\nRepublicans hold six of the eight elected seats \\ton the Alabama State Board of Education . \\nIn 2010 , Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature \\t, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years . \\nThe last remaining statewide Democrat , who served on the \\tAlabama Public Service Commission , was defeated in 2012 . \\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction , when Republicans \\tgenerally represented Reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise . \\nThe three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom ( 1999–2003 ) , \\tKay Ivey ( 2011–2017 ) , and Will Ainsworth ( 2019–present ) . \\nLocal \\telections . \\nMany local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education \\t, tax assessors , tax collectors , etc . ) \\nin the state are \\tstill held by Democrats . \\nMany rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats , \\tresulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary . \\nSimilarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are \\teffectively decided in the Republican Primary , although there are exceptions . \\nAlabama 's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at-large races \\t, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts . \\nThe current split is 35 Democrats , \\t31 Republicans , and one Independent Fayette . \\nHowever , most of the Democratic sheriffs \\tpreside over rural and less populated counties . \\nThe majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected \\tin the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties . \\n, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff , \\tin Morgan County , Alabama , and ten African-American sheriffs . \\nFederal \\telections . \\nThe state 's two U.S. senators are Richard C. Shelby \\tand Tommy Tuberville , both of whom are Republican . \\nShelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected \\tin 1992 , but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election . \\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives , the state is represented by seven members , six of whom are Republicans : ( Jerry Carl , Mike Rogers , Robert Aderholt , Mo Brooks , \\tBarry Moore , and Gary Palmer ) and one Democrat : Terri Sewell , who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham , Tuscaloosa and Montgomery . \\nEducation \\t. \\nPrimary and \\tsecondary education . \\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of \\tEducation as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education . \\nTogether , 1,496 individual schools provide education \\tfor 744,637 elementary and secondary students . \\nPublic school funding is appropriated through the \\tAlabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund . \\nIn FY 2006–2007 , Alabama appropriated $ \\t3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education . \\nThat represented an increase of $ \\t444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year . \\nIn 2007 , more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) toward student \\tproficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law , using measures determined by the state of Alabama . \\nWhile Alabama 's public education system has improved in recent decades \\t, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states . \\nAccording to U.S. Census data ( 2000 ) , Alabama 's high school graduation rate ( 75 \\t% ) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. ( after Kentucky , Louisiana and Mississippi ) . \\nThe largest educational gains were among people \\twith some college education but without degrees . \\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large , school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama , with 27,260 \\tpublic school students paddled at least one time , according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year . \\nThe rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama \\tis surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas . \\nColleges and \\tuniversities . \\nAlabama 's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities , \\ttwo-year community colleges , and 17 private , undergraduate and graduate universities . \\nIn the state are four medical schools ( as of fall 2015 ) ( University of Alabama School of Medicine , University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus ) , two veterinary colleges ( Auburn University and Tuskegee University ) , a dental school ( University of Alabama School \\tof Dentistry ) , an optometry college ( University of Alabama at Birmingham ) , two pharmacy schools ( Auburn University and Samford University ) , and five law schools ( University of Alabama School of Law , Birmingham School of Law , Cumberland School of Law , Miles Law School , and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law ) . \\nPublic , post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama \\tCommission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education . \\nColleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year \\tassociate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs . \\nThe largest single campus is the University of Alabama , \\tlocated in Tuscaloosa , with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016 . \\nTroy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010 , with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses ( Troy \\t, Dothan , Montgomery , and Phenix City ) , as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries . \\nThe oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and \\tthe Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile , both founded in 1830 . \\nAccreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools ( SACS ) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association \\tfor Biblical Higher Education ( ABHE ) , the Council on Occupational Education ( COE ) , and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools ( ACICS ) . \\nAccording to the 2011 `` U.S. News & amp ;

I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham , where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state \\tand I-20 continues east towards Atlanta ; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line , providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta ; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state , traveling from west to east through Mobile . \\nI-22 enters the state from Mississippi and \\tconnects Birmingham with Memphis , Tennessee . \\nIn addition , there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state : I-165 in Mobile , \\tI-359 in Tuscaloosa , I-459 around Birmingham , I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville , and I-759 in Gadsden . \\nA sixth route , I-685 , will be formed when \\tI-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery . \\nA proposed northern bypass of Birmingham \\twill be designated as I-422 . \\nSince a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not \\tbe possible , I-222 has been proposed , as well . \\nSeveral \\tU.S . \\nHighways also pass through the state , such as U.S. Route 11 ( US-11 ) , US-29 , US-31 , US-43 , US-45 , US-72 \\t, US-78 , US-80 , US-82 , US-84 , US-90 , US-98 , US-231 , US-278 , US-280 , US-331 , US-411 , and US-431 . \\nThere are four toll roads in the state : Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery ;

P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of `` \\t-λλ- '' and `` -λ- '' in epic language , which may account for a palatalized phoneme /ly/ in the original language . \\nDescription \\t. \\nIn the account of Dares the Phrygian , Achilles was described having `` . . \\t.a large chest , a fine mouth , and powerfully formed arms and legs . \\nHis head was covered with \\tlong wavy chestnut-colored hair . \\nThough mild in manner , he \\twas very fierce in battle . \\nHis face showed the joy of \\ta man richly endowed . '' \\nBirth and \\tearly years . \\nAchilles was the son of Thetis , a Nereid and daughter of The Old \\tMan of the Sea , and Peleus , the king of the Myrmidons . \\nZeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetis 's hand in marriage until Prometheus , the fore-thinker , warned Zeus of a \\tprophecy ( originally uttered by Themis , goddess of divine law ) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father . \\nFor this reason , the two gods withdrew \\ttheir pursuit , and had her wed Peleus . \\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : In the `` Argonautica '' ( 4.760 ) Zeus ' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis \\t' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus , pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera 's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods . \\nThetis , although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus , was also brought \\tup by Hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus . \\nZeus was furious and decreed that \\tshe would never marry an immortal . \\nAccording to the `` Achilleid '' , written by Statius in the 1st century AD , and to non-surviving previous sources , when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him \\timmortal by dipping him in the river Styx ; however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him : his left heel . \\nIt is not clear if this \\tversion of events was known earlier . \\nIn another version of this story , Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him \\ton top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body . \\nShe was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned \\tboth father and son in a rage . \\nNone of the sources before Statius make \\tany reference to this general invulnerability . \\nTo the contrary , in the `` Iliad '' , Homer mentions Achilles being wounded : in \\tBook 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus , son of Pelagon , challenged Achilles by the river Scamander . \\nHe was ambidextrous , and cast a spear from each hand ; one \\tgrazed Achilles ' elbow , `` drawing a spurt of blood '' . \\nIn the few fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle \\twhich describe the hero 's death ( i.e . \\nthe `` Cypria '' , the `` Little Iliad '' by Lesches of Pyrrha , the `` Aithiopis '' and `` Iliou persis '' \\tby Arctinus of Miletus ) , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel . \\nIn the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles , the \\tarrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his torso . \\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur , who \\tlived on Mount Pelion , to be reared . \\nThetis foretold that her son 's fate was either to gain glory and \\tdie young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity . \\nAchilles chose the former , and decided \\tto take part in the Trojan War . \\nAccording to Homer , Achilles grew up \\tin Phthia with his companion Patroclus . \\nAccording to Photius , the sixth book of the `` New History '' by Ptolemy \\tHephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus . \\nWhen she had Achilles , Peleus noticed , tore him from the flames \\twith only a burnt foot , and confided him to the centaur Chiron . \\nLater Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus , who was the fastest of all \\tthe giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into Achilles ' burnt foot . \\nOther \\tnames . \\nAmong the appellations under which Achilles is generally \\tknown are the following : Hidden on Skyros . \\nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war , Thetis ( or , in some versions , Peleus \\t) hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of Lycomedes , king of Skyros . \\nThere , Achilles , properly disguised , lived among Lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name \\t`` Pyrrha '' ( the red-haired girl ) , Cercysera or Aissa ( `` swift '' ) . \\nWith Lycomedes ' daughter Deidamia , whom in the account of Statius he raped , Achilles there fathered \\ttwo sons , Neoptolemus ( also called Pyrrhus , after his father 's possible alias ) and Oneiros . \\nAccording to this story , Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that \\tthe Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles ' aid . \\nOdysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women 's \\tclothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods . \\nWhen Achilles instantly took up the spear , Odysseus saw through \\this disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign . \\nIn another version of the story , Odysseus arranged for a trumpet \\talarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes ' women . \\nWhile the women fled in panic , Achilles prepared to \\tdefend the court , thus giving his identity away . \\nIn the \\tTrojan War . \\nAccording to the `` Iliad '' , Achilles arrived at \\tTroy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 Myrmidons . \\nHe appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons ) \\t: Menesthius , Eudorus , Peisander , Phoenix and Alcimedon . \\nTelephus \\t. \\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War , they \\taccidentally stopped in Mysia , ruled by King Telephus . \\nIn the resulting battle , Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal ; \\tTelephus consulted an oracle , who stated that `` he that wounded shall heal '' . \\nGuided by the oracle , he arrived at Argos , where Achilles healed him \\tin order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy . \\nAccording to other reports in Euripides ' lost play about Telephus , he went \\tto Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound . \\nAchilles refused , claiming to \\thave no medical knowledge . \\nAlternatively , Telephus held Orestes for ransom , the \\transom being Achilles ' aid in healing the wound . \\nOdysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; \\ttherefore , the spear must be able to heal it . \\nPieces of the spear were scraped off \\tonto the wound and Telephus was healed . \\nTroilus \\t. \\nAccording to the `` Cypria '' ( the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles ' wrath ) , when the Achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by Achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas , sacked neighbouring cities ( like Pedasus and Lyrnessus , where the Greeks \\tcapture the queen Briseis ) and killed Tenes , a son of Apollo , as well as Priam 's son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios ; however , the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer 's `` Troilus and Criseyde '' and in William Shakespeare 's `` Troilus and Cressida '' is a medieval invention . \\nIn Dares Phrygius ' `` Account of the Destruction of Troy '' , the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe , as well as in older \\taccounts , Troilus was a young Trojan prince , the youngest of King Priam 's and Hecuba 's five legitimate sons ( or according other sources , another son of Apollo ) . \\nDespite his youth , he was one of the main Trojan war leaders , \\ta `` horse fighter '' or `` chariot fighter '' according to Homer . \\nProphecies linked Troilus ' fate to that of Troy and \\tso he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him . \\nYet Achilles , struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his \\tsexual attentions on the youth – who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios . \\nLater versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally \\tkilled by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers ' embrace . \\nIn this version of the myth , Achilles ' \\tdeath therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege . \\nAncient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of \\ta dead child mourned by his parents . \\nHad Troilus lived to adulthood , the First Vatican Mythographer claimed , Troy would have been invincible \\t; however , the motif is older and found already in Plautus ' `` Bacchides '' . \\nIn the `` \\tIliad '' . \\nHomer 's `` Iliad '' is the most famous \\tnarrative of Achilles ' deeds in the Trojan War . \\nAchilles ' wrath ( μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως , `` mênis Achilléōs \\t'' ) is the central theme of the poem . \\nThe first two lines of the `` Iliad '' read : The Homeric epic only covers \\ta few weeks of the decade-long war , and does not narrate Achilles ' death . \\nIt begins with Achilles ' withdrawal from battle after being \\tdishonoured by Agamemnon , the commander of the Achaean forces . \\nAgamemnon has taken a woman \\tnamed Chryseis as his slave . \\nHer father Chryses , a priest of Apollo \\t, begs Agamemnon to return her to him . \\nAgamemnon refuses , and Apollo sends \\ta plague amongst the Greeks . \\nThe prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles \\tbut will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him . \\nAchilles does so , and Calchas declares that \\tChryseis must be returned to her father . \\nAgamemnon consents , but then commands that Achilles ' battle prize Briseis , \\tthe daughter of Briseus , be brought to him to replace Chryseis . \\nAngry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves Briseis \\t) , with the urging of his mother Thetis , Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces . \\nAt the same time , burning with rage over Agamemnon 's theft , Achilles prays to Thetis to convince \\tZeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour . \\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks , thanks to the influence of Zeus , Nestor declares that \\tthe Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior . \\nAgamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two \\tother chieftains , Ajax and Phoenix . \\nThey promise that , if Achilles returns to battle , \\tAgamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts . \\nAchilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the \\tGreeks to sail home as he was planning to do . \\nThe Trojans , led by Hector , subsequently push the Greek \\tarmy back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships . \\nWith the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , Patroclus leads the Myrmidons \\tinto battle , wearing Achilles ' armour , though Achilles remains at his camp . \\nPatroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches , but is killed \\tby Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy . \\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus , the \\tson of Nestor , Achilles grieves over his beloved companion 's death . \\nHis mother Thetis comes to \\tcomfort the distraught Achilles . \\nShe persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him , in place of \\tthe armour that Patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by Hector . \\nThe new armour includes the Shield of Achilles \\t, described in great detail in the poem . \\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus , Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes \\tthe field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector . \\nAchilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander , who has become \\tangry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed . \\nThe god tries to drown Achilles but \\tis stopped by Hera and Hephaestus . \\nZeus himself takes note of Achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack \\tTroy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself . \\nFinally , Achilles \\tfinds his prey . \\nAchilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena , in the form of Hector 's \\tfavorite and dearest brother , Deiphobus , persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face . \\nAfter Hector realizes the trick , \\the knows the battle is inevitable . \\nWanting to go down fighting , he charges at Achilles \\twith his only weapon , his sword , but misses . \\nAccepting his fate , Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life \\t, but to treat his body with respect after killing him . \\nAchilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that `` my rage , my fury would \\tdrive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me '' . \\nAchilles then kills Hector and drags his \\tcorpse by its heels behind his chariot . \\nAfter having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral , \\tAchilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion . \\nAt the onset of his duel with Hector , Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky \\t, which comes on in the autumn , Orion 's dog ( Sirius ) ; a sign of evil . \\nDuring the cremation of Patroclus , he is compared to Hesperus , the evening/western star ( Venus ) , while the \\tburning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus , the morning/eastern star ( also Venus ) has set ( descended ) . \\nWith the assistance of the god Hermes ( Argeiphontes ) , Hector 's father Priam goes to Achilles ' \\ttent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector 's body so that he can be buried . \\nAchilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral , lasting 9 days \\twith a burial on the 10th ( in the tradition of Niobe 's offspring ) . \\nThe poem ends with a description of Hector 's funeral , \\twith the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come . \\nLater epic accounts : \\tfighting Penthesilea and Memnon . \\nThe `` Aethiopis '' ( 7th century BC ) and a work named `` Posthomerica '' , composed \\tby Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century CE , relate further events from the Trojan War . \\nWhen Penthesilea , queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares , \\tarrives in Troy , Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles . \\nAfter his temporary truce with Priam , Achilles fights and kills \\tthe warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later . \\nAt first , he was so distracted by her beauty \\t, he did not fight as intensely as usual . \\nOnce he realized that his distraction was endangering \\this life , he refocused and killed her . \\nFollowing the death of Patroclus , Nestor 's \\tson Antilochus becomes Achilles ' closest companion . \\nWhen Memnon , son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia , \\tslays Antilochus , Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing Memnon . \\nConsequently , Eos will not let the \\tsun rise until Zeus persuades her . \\nThe fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus \\t, except that Memnon ( unlike Hector ) was also the son of a goddess . \\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the `` Iliad '' \\ts description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles ' reaction to it . \\nThe episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic `` Aethiopis '' , which \\twas composed after the `` Iliad '' , possibly in the 7th century BC . \\nThe `` Aethiopis '' is now lost , \\texcept for scattered fragments quoted by later authors . \\nAchilles and \\tPatroclus . \\nThe exact nature of Achilles ' relationship with Patroclus has been a \\tsubject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times . \\nIn the `` Iliad '' , it appears to \\tbe the model of a deep and loyal friendship . \\nHomer does not suggest that Achilles and \\this close friend Patroclus had sexual relations . \\nAlthough there is no direct evidence in the text of the `` Iliad '' that \\tAchilles and Patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors . \\nCommentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted \\tthe relationship through the lens of their own cultures . \\nIn 5th-century BC Athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of `` \\tpaiderasteia '' , which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one , usually a teenager . \\nIn Patroclus and Achilles ' case , Achilles would have been \\tthe younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder . \\nIn Plato 's `` Symposium '' , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple \\t; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover . \\nHowever , ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was \\tassumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women . \\nMany pairs of men throughout history have been compared \\tto Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship . \\nDeath \\t. \\nThe death of Achilles , even if considered solely as it occurred in \\tthe oldest sources , is a complex one , with many different versions . \\nStarting with the oldest account , In the `` Iliad Book XXII '' , Hector predicts with his last dying breath that Paris \\tand Apollo will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy ( with an arrow to the heel according to Statius ) . \\n`` In Book XXIII '' , the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber \\t, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase , a gift of his mother . \\nIn the `` Odyssey Book XI '' , Odysseus \\tsails to the underworld and converses with the shades . \\nOne of these is Achilles , who when greeted as `` blessed in life , blessed in death '' , \\tresponds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead . \\nBut Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son 's exploits in the Trojan war , \\tand when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus ' heroic actions , Achilles is filled with satisfaction . \\nIn the `` Odyssey Book XXIV '' we read dead King Agamemnon 's ghostly account of his death : Achilles \\t' funeral pyre bleached bones had been mixed with those of Patroclus and put into his mother 's golden vase . \\nAlso , the bones of Antilocus , who had become closer to \\tAchilles than any other following Patroclus ' death , were separately enclosed . \\nAnd , the customary funeral games of a hero were performed , and a \\tmassive tomb or mound was built on the Hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate . \\nAchilles was represented in the `` Aethiopis '' as living after his death \\tin the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube . \\nAnother version of Achilles ' death is that he fell deeply \\tin love with one of the Trojan princesses , Polyxena . \\nAchilles asks Priam for Polyxena \\t's hand in marriage . \\nPriam is willing because it would mean the end of the \\twar and an alliance with the world 's greatest warrior . \\nBut while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles , Paris , who would have to give up \\tHelen if Achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow , killing him . \\nAccording to some accounts , he had married Medea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in \\tthe Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius ' `` Argonautica '' ( 3rd century BC ) . \\nFate of Achilles \\t' armour . \\nAchilles ' armour was the object of a feud between \\tOdysseus and Telamonian Ajax ( Ajax the greater ) . \\nThey competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners \\t, who , after considering both men 's presentations , decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour . \\nFurious , Ajax cursed Odysseus , which earned him the ire of Athena , who temporarily made \\tAjax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades . \\nAfter a while , when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he \\thad actually been killing sheep , he was so ashamed that he committed suicide . \\nOdysseus eventually gave the armour to \\tNeoptolemus , the son of Achilles . \\nWhen Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades ( `` Odyssey '' 11.543–566 ) \\t, Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus . \\nThe armour they fought for was made by Hephaestus thus making it \\tmuch stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft . \\nHe was made the gear because his first set was worn by Patroclus \\twhen he went to battle and taken by Hector when he killed Patroclus . \\nThe Shield of Achilles was also \\tmade by the fire god . \\nHis legendary spear was given to him by his \\tmentor Chiron before he participated in the Trojan War . \\nIt was called the Pelian Spear which \\tallegedly no other man could wield . \\nA relic claimed to be Achilles ' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple \\tof Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis , Lycia , a port on the Pamphylian Gulf . \\nThe city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great , who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the `` Iliad '' with him \\t, but his court biographers do not mention the spear ; however , it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century CE . \\nAchilles , Ajax and a \\tgame of `` petteia '' . \\nNumerous paintings on pottery have suggested a \\ttale not mentioned in the literary traditions . \\nAt some point in the war , Achilles and Ajax \\twere playing a board game ( `` petteia '' ) . \\nThey were absorbed in the game \\tand oblivious to the surrounding battle . \\nThe Trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who \\twere saved only by an intervention of Athena . \\nWorship and \\theroic cult . \\nThe tomb of Achilles , extant throughout antiquity in Troad , was venerated by Thessalians , but also \\tby Persian expeditionary forces , as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla . \\nAchilles ' cult was also to be found at other places , e. g. on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades , in Sparta which had a sanctuary , in Elis \\tand in Achilles ' homeland Thessaly , as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum , Locri and Croton , accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero . \\nThe cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BC Polyxena sarcophagus \\t, which depicts the sacrifice of Polyxena near the tumulus of Achilles . \\nStrabo ( 13.1.32 ) also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad : The spread and intensity of the hero 's veneration \\tamong the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus , today 's Black Sea , appears to have been remarkable . \\nAn archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the \\tBlack Sea , today identified with Snake Island ( Ukrainian Зміїний , `` Zmiinyi '' , near Kiliya , Ukraine ) . \\nEarly dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea ( graffiti and inscribed clay disks , these possibly being votive offerings , from Olbia \\t, the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese ) attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards . \\nThe cult was still thriving in the third century CE , when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an `` Achilles Pontárchēs '' ( Ποντάρχης , roughly `` lord of the Sea , '' or `` of \\tthe Pontus Euxinus '' ) , who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia , venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates , Hermes Agoraeus , or Poseidon . \\nPliny the Elder ( 23–79 AD ) in his `` Natural History '' mentions a `` port of the Achæi '' and an `` island of Achilles '' , famous for the tomb of that `` man '' ( ) , situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper-Bug Estuary ; furthermore , at 125 Roman miles \\tfrom this island , he places a peninsula `` which stretches forth in the shape of a sword '' obliquely , called `` Dromos Achilleos '' ( Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος , `` Achilléōs drómos '' `` the Race-course of Achilles '' ) and considered the place of the hero 's exercise or of games instituted by him . \\nThis last feature of Pliny 's account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today `` Tendra '' ( or `` Kosa Tendra '' and `` Kosa Djarilgatch '' ) \\t, situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay , but which is hardly 125 Roman miles ( km ) away from the Dnieper-Bug estuary , as Pliny states . \\n( To the `` Race-course '' he gives a length of 80 \\tmiles , km , whereas the spit measures km today . ) \\nIn the following chapter of his book , Pliny refers to the same island as `` Achillea '' and introduces two further names for \\tit : `` Leuce '' or `` Macaron '' ( from Greek [ νῆσος ] μακαρῶν `` island of the blest '' ) . \\nThe `` present day '' measures , he gives at this point , seem to account \\tfor an identification of `` Achillea '' or `` Leuce '' with today 's Snake Island . \\nPliny 's contemporary Pomponius Mela ( ) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named `` \\tAchillea '' , situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister , adding to the geographical confusion . \\nRuins of a square temple , measuring 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated \\tto Achilles , were discovered by Captain Kritzikly ( ) in 1823 on Snake Island . \\nA second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of \\ta lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple . \\nA fifth century BC black-glazed lekythos inscription , found on the island in 1840 , reads : \\t`` Glaukos , son of Poseidon , dedicated me to Achilles , lord of Leuke . '' \\nIn another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC , a statue is dedicated to Achilles , lord of Leuke , by a citizen of Olbia , while in \\ta further dedication , the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island 's cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration . \\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on `` Leuce '' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic `` Aethiopis '' according to which , after \\this untimely death , Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical ( `` Leúkē Nêsos '' `` White Island '' ) . \\nAlready in the fifth century BC , Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a `` bright island '' ( φαεννά νᾶσος , `` phaenná nâsos '' ) of the Black Sea , while \\tin another of his works , Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus . \\nWell known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles ( μακαρῶν νῆσοι , `` makárôn nêsoi '' ) or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus \\twhich according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it . \\nGuy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus , speaking of `` Achilles lord of Scythia '' and the \\topposition of North and South , as evoked by Achilles ' fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death . \\nThe `` Periplus of the Euxine Sea '' ( ) gives the following details : The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes , who likely lived during \\tthe first century CE , wrote that the island was called `` Leuce '' `` because the wild animals which live there are white . \\nIt is said that there , in Leuce island , reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of \\tthis island ; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour '' . \\nSimilarly , others relate the island 's name to \\tits white cliffs , snakes or birds dwelling there . \\nPausanias has been told that the island is `` covered with \\tforests and full of animals , some wild , some tame . \\nIn this island there is also Achilles \\t' temple and his statue '' . \\nLeuce had also a reputation \\tas a place of healing . \\nPausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord \\tof Croton to be cured of a chest wound . \\nAmmianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters ( \\t`` aquae '' ) on the island . \\nStrabo mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to \\tAchilles and although it was treeless , was called Alsos ( ἄλσος ) . \\n`` Alsos '' in Greek \\tmeans `` grove '' . \\nA number of important commercial port cities of \\tthe Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles . \\nHerodotus , Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town `` Achílleion '' ( Ἀχίλλειον ) , built \\tby settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC , close to the hero 's presumed burial mound in the Troad . \\nLater attestations point to an `` Achílleion '' in Messenia ( according to \\tStephanus Byzantinus ) and an `` Achílleios '' ( Ἀχίλλειος ) in Laconia . \\nNicolae Densuşianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta , called Chilia ( presumably from \\tan older `` Achileii '' ) , though his conclusion , that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea , evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law . \\nThe kings of Epirus claimed to be descended \\tfrom Achilles through his son , Neoptolemus . \\nAlexander the Great , son of the Epirote princess Olympias , could therefore also claim \\tthis descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor . \\nHe is said to have visited the tomb \\tof Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy . \\nIn AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla , while on his way to \\twar against Parthia , emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles ' tumulus . \\nReception during \\tantiquity . \\nIn Greek \\ttragedy . \\nThe Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles \\t, given the title `` Achilleis '' by modern scholars . \\nThe tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War , including his defeat of Hector \\tand eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel . \\nExtant fragments of the `` Achilleis '' and other Aeschylean \\tfragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play . \\nThe first part of the `` Achilleis '' trilogy , `` The Myrmidons '' , focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus , \\twho represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today . \\nIn Plato 's `` Symposium '' , Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved ; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because \\tAchilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him . \\nThe tragedian Sophocles also wrote `` The Lovers of Achilles \\t'' , a play with Achilles as the main character . \\nOnly a few \\tfragments survive . \\nTowards the end of the 5th century BC , a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama ; Euripides refers to \\tAchilles in a bitter or ironic tone in `` Hecuba '' , `` Electra '' , and `` Iphigenia in Aulis '' . \\nIn Greek \\tphilosophy . \\nZeno \\t. \\nThe philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between `` swift-footed '' Achilles and a tortoise , by which he \\tattempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible . \\nAs a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the \\tEleatic school , Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions . \\nPlato \\t. \\nIn `` Hippias Minor '' , a dialogue attributed to \\tPlato , an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates . \\nThe two get into \\ta discussion about lying . \\nThey decide that a person who is intentionally false must be `` better '' than a person who is unintentionally \\tfalse , on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying . \\nSocrates uses various analogies , discussing athletics \\tand the sciences to prove his point . \\nThe two also \\treference Homer extensively . \\nSocrates and Hippias agree that Odysseus , who concocted a number of lies throughout the \\t`` Odyssey '' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle , was false intentionally . \\nAchilles , like Odysseus \\t, told numerous falsehoods . \\nHippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man , \\twhile Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit . \\nThe two argue over whether it is better \\tto lie on purpose or by accident . \\nSocrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point : someone \\twho does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally . \\nIn Roman and \\tmedieval literature . \\nThe Romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to \\tTroy , took a highly negative view of Achilles . \\nVirgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of \\tmen , while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children . \\nOther writers , such as Catullus , Propertius , and Ovid , represent a \\tsecond strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on Achilles ' erotic career . \\nThis strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure 's `` Roman de Troie '' \\tand Guido delle Colonne 's `` Historia destructionis Troiae '' , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century . \\nAchilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon , not as Hellene , but as Scythian , while according to \\tthe Byzantine author John Malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars . \\nIn modern literature \\tand arts . \\nMusic \\t. \\nAchilles has been frequently the subject of \\toperas , ballets and related genres . \\nFilm and \\ttelevision . \\nIn films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series : < /doc > < doc id= '' 306 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=306 '' title= '' AppliedStatistics '' > AppliedStatistics < /doc > < doc id= '' 307 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki \\t? curid=307 '' title= '' Abraham Lincoln '' > Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln ( ; February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was an American lawyer , politician , and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865 . \\nLincoln led the nation through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union \\t, abolishing slavery , bolstering the federal government , and modernizing the U.S. economy . \\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky \\tand was raised on the frontier , primarily in Indiana . \\nHe was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig \\tParty leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . \\nCongressman from \\tIllinois . \\nIn 1849 , he returned to his \\tsuccessful law practice in central Illinois . \\nIn 1854 , he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act , \\twhich opened the territories to slavery , and he re-entered politics . \\nHe soon became a leader \\tof the new Republican Party . \\nHe reached a national audience in the 1858 \\tSenate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas . \\nLincoln ran for president in 1860 , \\tsweeping the North to gain victory . \\nPro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat \\tto slavery , and Southern states began seceding from the Union . \\nDuring this time , the newly formed Confederate States of \\tAmerica began seizing federal military bases in the south . \\nJust over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency , the Confederate \\tStates attacked Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in South Carolina . \\nFollowing the bombardment , Lincoln mobilized forces to \\tsuppress the rebellion and restore the Union . \\nLincoln , a moderate Republican , had to navigate a contentious array of \\tfactions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties . \\nHis allies , the War Democrats and the Radical \\tRepublicans , demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates . \\nAnti-war Democrats ( called `` Copperheads '' ) despised \\tLincoln , and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination . \\nHe managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity , carefully \\tdistributing political patronage , and by appealing to the American people . \\nHis Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of \\tthe greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose . \\nLincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort , including the \\tselection of generals , and implemented a naval blockade of the South 's trade . \\nHe suspended `` habeas corpus '' in Maryland and elsewhere , and \\the averted British intervention by defusing the `` Trent '' Affair . \\nIn 1863 , he issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which declared the \\tslaves in the states `` in rebellion '' to be free . \\nIt also directed the Army and Navy to `` recognize and maintain the freedom of such \\tpersons '' and to receive them `` into the armed service of the United States . '' \\nLincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery , and he promoted the Thirteenth \\tAmendment to the United States Constitution , which upon its ratification abolished slavery . \\nLincoln managed his own \\tsuccessful re-election campaign . \\nHe sought to heal the \\twar-torn nation through reconciliation . \\nOn April 14 , 1865 , just five days after the war 's end at Appomattox , he was attending a play at \\tFord 's Theatre in Washington , D.C. , with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth . \\nLincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime \\tleadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery . \\nLincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly \\tpolls as the greatest president in American history . \\nFamily and \\tchildhood . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12 , 1809 , the second child of Thomas Lincoln and \\tNancy Hanks Lincoln , in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville , Kentucky . \\nHe was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln , an Englishman who migrated from Hingham \\t, Norfolk , to its namesake , Hingham , Massachusetts , in 1638 . \\nThe family then migrated west , passing through \\tNew Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . \\nLincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia ; his paternal grandfather and namesake , Captain \\tAbraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba ( née Herring ) moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County , Kentucky . \\nThe captain was killed in \\tan Indian raid in 1786 . \\nHis children , including eight-year-old Thomas , \\tAbraham 's father , witnessed the attack . \\nThomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the \\tfamily settled in Hardin County , Kentucky , in the early 1800s . \\nThe heritage of Lincoln 's mother Nancy remains unclear , but it \\tis widely assumed that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks . \\nThomas and Nancy married on June 12 , 1806 , \\tin Washington County , and moved to Elizabethtown , Kentucky . \\nThey had three children : Sarah , Abraham , \\tand Thomas , who died as an infant . \\nThomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all \\tbut of his land in court disputes over property titles . \\nIn 1816 , the family moved to Indiana where \\tthe land surveys and titles were more reliable . \\nIndiana was a `` free '' ( non-slaveholding ) territory , and they settled \\tin an `` unbroken forest '' in Hurricane Township , Perry County , Indiana . \\nIn 1860 , Lincoln noted that the family 's move to Indiana was `` \\tpartly on account of slavery '' , but mainly due to land title difficulties . \\nIn Kentucky and Indiana , Thomas worked as \\ta farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter . \\nAt various times , he owned farms , livestock , and town lots , paid \\ttaxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , and served on county patrols . \\nThomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptists church \\t, which forbade alcohol , dancing , and slavery . \\nOvercoming financial challenges , Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to in \\tIndiana , an area which became the Little Pigeon Creek Community . \\nMother 's \\tdeath . \\nOn October 5 , 1818 , Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness , leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of \\ta household including her father , 9-year-old Abraham , and Nancy 's 19-year-old orphan cousin , Dennis Hanks . \\nTen years later , on January 20 , 1828 , Sarah \\tdied while giving birth to a stillborn son , devastating Lincoln . \\nOn December 2 , 1819 , Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston , a \\twidow from Elizabethtown , Kentucky , with three children of her own . \\nAbraham became close to his stepmother \\tand called her `` Mother '' . \\nLincoln disliked the hard labor \\tassociated with farm life . \\nHis family even said he was lazy , for all his `` reading \\t, scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing Poetry , etc . `` . \\nHis stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy `` \\tphysical labor '' , but loved to read . \\nEducation and move \\tto Illinois . \\nLincoln was \\tlargely self-educated . \\nHis formal schooling was \\tfrom itinerant teachers . \\nIt included two short stints in Kentucky , where he learned to read but probably not to write , at age seven , and in Indiana , \\twhere he went to school sporadically due to farm chores , for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15 . \\nHe persisted as an avid reader and \\tretained a lifelong interest in learning . \\nFamily , neighbors , and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the King James Bible , Aesop 's Fables , John Bunyan 's \\t`` The Pilgrim 's Progress '' , Daniel Defoe 's `` Robinson Crusoe '' , and `` The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin '' . \\nAs a teen , Lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his \\tfather all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21 . \\nLincoln was tall , strong , and athletic \\t, and became adept at using an ax . \\nHe was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in \\tthe rough catch-as-catch-can style ( also known as catch wrestling ) . \\nHe became county wrestling champion \\tat the age of 21 . \\nHe gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with \\tthe renowned leader of ruffians known as `` the Clary 's Grove Boys '' . \\nIn March 1830 , fearing another milk sickness outbreak , several members of the extended Lincoln family , \\tincluding Abraham , moved west to Illinois , a free state , and settled in Macon County . \\nAbraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas , in \\tpart due to his father 's lack of education . \\nIn 1831 , as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a new \\thomestead in Coles County , Illinois , Abraham struck out on his own . \\nHe made his home in New Salem \\t, Illinois , for six years . \\nLincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to New Orleans \\t, Louisiana , where he was first exposed to slavery . \\nIn 1865 , Lincoln was asked how \\the came to acquire his rhetorical skills . \\nHe answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across \\tthe word `` demonstrate '' but had insufficient understanding of the term . \\nSo , he left Springfield for his father 's home to study until he `` could give any proposition \\tin the six books of Euclid [ here , referencing Euclid 's `` Elements '' ] at sight . '' \\nMarriage and \\tchildren . \\nLincoln 's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge , \\twhom he met when he moved to New Salem . \\nBy 1835 , they were in \\ta relationship but not formally engaged . \\nShe died on August 25 , 1835 \\t, most likely of typhoid fever . \\nIn the early 1830s , he \\tmet Mary Owens from Kentucky . \\nLate in 1836 , Lincoln agreed to a match \\twith Owens if she returned to New Salem . \\nOwens arrived that November and he courted her for a \\ttime ; however , they both had second thoughts . \\nOn August 16 , 1837 , he wrote Owens a letter saying he would \\tnot blame her if she ended the relationship , and she never replied . \\nIn 1839 , Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield , \\tIllinois , and the following year they became engaged . \\nShe was the daughter of Robert Smith Todd , \\ta wealthy lawyer and businessman in Lexington , Kentucky . \\nA wedding set for January 1 , 1841 , was canceled at Lincoln 's request , but they \\treconciled and married on November 4 , 1842 , in the Springfield mansion of Mary 's sister . \\nWhile anxiously preparing for the nuptials , he was asked where he \\twas going and replied , `` To hell , I suppose . '' \\nIn 1844 , the couple bought a \\thouse in Springfield near his law office . \\nMary kept house with the help of \\ta hired servant and a relative . \\nLincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons \\t, though his work regularly kept him away from home . \\nThe oldest , Robert Todd Lincoln , was born in \\t1843 and was the only child to live to maturity . \\nEdward Baker Lincoln ( Eddie ) , born in 1846 \\t, died February 1 , 1850 , probably of tuberculosis . \\nLincoln 's third son , `` Willie '' Lincoln was born on December 21 , 1850 \\t, and died of a fever at the White House on February 20 , 1862 . \\nThe youngest , Thomas `` Tad '' Lincoln , was born on April 4 , 1853 , \\tand survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16 , 1871 . \\nLincoln `` was remarkably fond of children '' and the \\tLincolns were not considered to be strict with their own . \\nIn fact , Lincoln 's law partner William H. Herndon would \\tgrow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office . \\nTheir father , it seemed , was often too absorbed \\tin his work to notice his children 's behavior . \\nHerndon recounted , `` I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring \\ttheir little necks , and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut . \\nLincoln did not note what his children \\twere doing or had done . '' \\nThe deaths of their sons , Eddie and \\tWillie , had profound effects on both parents . \\nLincoln suffered from `` melancholy '' , a \\tcondition now thought to be clinical depression . \\nLater in life , Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and \\tsons , and Robert committed her for a time to an asylum in 1875 . \\nEarly career and \\tmilitia service . \\nDuring 1831 and 1832 , Lincoln worked at \\ta general store in New Salem , Illinois . \\nIn 1832 , he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives , but interrupted \\this campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War . \\nWhen Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War , he planned to become a blacksmith , but instead formed \\ta partnership with William Berry , 21 , with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit . \\nBecause a license was required to sell customers single beverages , Berry obtained bartending licenses for $ 7 \\teach for Lincoln and himself , and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well . \\nAs licensed bartenders , Lincoln and Berry were able to sell \\tspirits , including liquor , for 12 cents a pint . \\nThey offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages \\tas well as food , including takeout dinners . \\nBut Berry became an alcoholic , was often too drunk to \\twork , and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself . \\nAlthough the economy was booming , the business struggled and \\twent into debt , causing Lincoln to sell his share . \\nIn his first campaign speech after returning from his military service , Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under \\tattack , grabbed the assailant by his `` neck and the seat of his trousers '' , and tossed him . \\nIn the campaign , Lincoln advocated for \\tnavigational improvements on the Sangamon River . \\nHe could draw crowds as a raconteur , but lacked the requisite formal \\teducation , powerful friends , and money , and lost the election . \\nLincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , \\tthough he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct . \\nLincoln served as New Salem 's postmaster and later as county surveyor \\t, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer . \\nRather than studying in the office of an established attorney , as was the custom , Lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys John Todd Stuart \\tand Thomas Drummond , purchased books including Blackstone 's `` Commentaries '' and Chitty 's `` Pleadings '' , and read law on his own . \\nHe later said of his legal education \\tthat `` I studied with nobody . '' \\nIllinois state legislature \\t( 1834–1842 ) . \\nLincoln 's second state house campaign in 1834 , this time as \\ta Whig , was a success over a powerful Whig opponent . \\nThen followed his four terms in the \\tIllinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County . \\nHe championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan \\tCanal , and later was a Canal Commissioner . \\nHe voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males , \\tbut adopted a `` free soil '' stance opposing both slavery and abolition . \\nIn 1837 , he declared , `` [ The ] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and \\tbad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . '' \\nHe echoed Henry Clay 's support for the American Colonization Society which advocated \\ta program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia . \\nHe was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836 , and moved to Springfield \\tand began to practice law under John T. Stuart , Mary Todd 's cousin . \\nLincoln emerged as a formidable trial \\tcombatant during cross-examinations and closing arguments . \\nHe partnered several years with Stephen T. Logan , and in 1844 began \\this practice with William Herndon , `` a studious young man '' . \\nU.S. House of Representatives \\t( 1847–1849 ) . \\nTrue to his record , Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \\t`` an old line Whig , a disciple of Henry Clay '' . \\nTheir party favored economic modernization in banking , tariffs \\tto fund internal improvements including railroads , and urbanization . \\nIn 1843 , Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois ' 7th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives \\t; he was defeated by John J. Hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term . \\nLincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining \\tthe nomination in 1846 but also won the election . \\nHe was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation , but as dutiful as \\tany participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line . \\nHe was assigned to the Committee on Post Office and Post \\tRoads and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department . \\nLincoln teamed with Joshua R. Giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with \\tcompensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter . \\nHe dropped the bill when \\tit eluded Whig support . \\nPolitical \\tviews . \\nOn foreign and military policy , Lincoln spoke against the Mexican–American War , which he imputed to President James \\tK. Polk 's desire for `` military glory—that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood '' . \\nHe supported the Wilmot Proviso , a failed proposal to \\tban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico . \\nLincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by \\tdrafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions . \\nThe war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico , and Polk insisted \\tthat Mexican soldiers had `` invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil . '' \\nLincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood \\thad been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil . \\nThe resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers \\t, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district . \\nOne Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed \\thim `` spotty Lincoln '' . \\nLincoln later regretted some of his statements , \\tespecially his attack on presidential war-making powers . \\nLincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve \\tonly one term in the House . \\nRealizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency , he supported General \\tZachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . \\nTaylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to \\tbe appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office . \\nThe administration offered to appoint him secretary or \\tgovernor of the Oregon Territory as consolation . \\nThis distant territory was a Democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have disrupted \\this legal and political career in Illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice . \\nPrairie \\tlawyer . \\nIn his Springfield practice , Lincoln handled `` every kind \\tof business that could come before a prairie lawyer '' . \\nTwice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats \\tin the Midstate county courts ; this continued for 16 years . \\nLincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation 's western \\texpansion , particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges . \\nAs a riverboat man , Lincoln initially favored those \\tinterests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him . \\nHe later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in `` Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge \\tCompany '' , a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge . \\nIn 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation \\tdevice for the movement of boats in shallow water . \\nThe idea was never commercialized , but it made \\tLincoln the only president to hold a patent . \\nLincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases ; he was sole \\tcounsel in 51 cases , of which 31 were decided in his favor . \\nFrom 1853 to 1860 , one of his \\tlargest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad . \\nHis legal reputation gave rise to \\tthe nickname `` Honest Abe '' . \\nLincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial , defending William `` Duff '' \\tArmstrong , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker . \\nThe case is famous for Lincoln 's use of a fact \\testablished by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness . \\nAfter an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight , Lincoln produced a `` \\tFarmers ' Almanac '' showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility . \\nArmstrong was \\tacquitted . \\nLeading up to his presidential campaign , Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case , with his defense of Simeon Quinn \\t`` Peachy '' Harrison who was a third cousin ; Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln 's political opponent , Rev . \\nPeter \\tCartwright . \\nHarrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who , as he lay \\tdying of his wounds , confessed to Cartwright that he had provoked Harrison . \\nLincoln angrily protested the judge 's initial decision to exclude \\tCartwright 's testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay . \\nLincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration \\tand was not subject to the hearsay rule . \\nInstead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected , the judge , a Democrat \\t, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence , resulting in Harrison 's acquittal . \\nRepublican politics ( \\t1854–1860 ) . \\nEmergence as \\tRepublican leader . \\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the \\tfree North , with the failure of the Compromise of 1850 , a legislative package designed to address the issue . \\nIn his 1852 eulogy for Clay , Lincoln highlighted the latter 's support for \\tgradual emancipation and opposition to `` both extremes '' on the slavery issue . \\nAs the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious , Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed popular \\tsovereignty as a compromise ; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery . \\nThe legislation alarmed many Northerners , who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that \\tcould result , but Douglas 's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854 . \\nLincoln did not comment on the act until months later \\tin his `` Peoria Speech '' of October 1854 . \\nLincoln then declared his opposition to slavery , \\twhich he repeated en route to the presidency . \\nHe said the Kansas Act had a `` '' declared '' indifference , but as \\tI must think , a covert `` real '' zeal for the spread of slavery . \\nI can not \\tbut hate it . \\nI hate it because of the \\tmonstrous injustice of slavery itself . \\nI hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world \\t... '' Lincoln 's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life . \\nNationally , the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska \\tAct and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue . \\nReflecting on the demise of his party , Lincoln wrote in 1855 , `` I think I am \\ta Whig , but others say there are no Whigs , and that I am an abolitionist ... \\nI do no more than oppose the \\t`` extension '' of slavery . '' \\nThe new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery , drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil \\t, Liberty , and antislavery Democratic Party members , Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties , fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists . \\nLincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs , though he lamented \\this party 's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement . \\nIn 1854 , Lincoln was elected to the \\tIllinois legislature but declined to take his seat . \\nThe year 's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act , \\tand in the aftermath , Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate . \\nAt that time , senators were \\telected by the state legislature . \\nAfter leading in the first six rounds of voting \\t, he was unable to obtain a majority . \\nLincoln instructed his backers to \\tvote for Lyman Trumbull . \\nTrumbull was an antislavery Democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots \\t; his supporters , also antislavery Democrats , had vowed not to support any Whig . \\nLincoln 's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull 's antislavery \\tDemocrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate , Joel Aldrich Matteson . \\n1856 \\tcampaign . \\nViolent political confrontations in Kansas continued , and opposition \\tto the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North . \\nAs the 1856 elections approached , Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended \\tthe Bloomington Convention , which formally established the Illinois Republican Party . \\nThe convention platform endorsed Congress 's right to regulate slavery in the \\tterritories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state . \\nLincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the \\tparty platform and called for the preservation of the Union . \\nAt the June 1856 Republican National Convention , though Lincoln received support to run as vice president \\t, John C. Frémont and William Dayton comprised the ticket , which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois . \\nThe Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan \\tand the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore . \\nBuchanan prevailed , while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor \\tof Illinois , and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois . \\n`` Dred Scott \\tv. Sandford '' . \\nDred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state \\tto a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise . \\nAfter Scott was returned to the slave state \\the petitioned a federal court for his freedom . \\nHis petition was denied in `` Dred \\tScott v. Sandford '' ( 1857 ) . \\nIn his opinion , Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights \\tfrom the Constitution , and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners ' `` property '' rights . \\nWhile many Democrats hoped that `` Dred Scott '' would end the dispute over \\tslavery in the territories , the decision sparked further outrage in the North . \\nLincoln denounced it as the product of a \\tconspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power . \\nHe argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence ; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every \\trespect , they believed all men were equal `` in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' . \\nLincoln–Douglas debates and \\tCooper Union speech . \\nIn 1858 , Douglas was up for re-election in the \\tU.S. Senate , and Lincoln hoped to defeat him . \\nMany in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858 , \\tand Lincoln 's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor . \\nSome eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the \\tLecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state . \\nMany Illinois Republicans resented \\tthis eastern interference . \\nFor the first time , Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon \\ta Senate candidate , and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition . \\nLincoln accepted the nomination with \\tgreat enthusiasm and zeal . \\nAfter his nomination he delivered his House Divided Speech , with the biblical \\treference Mark 3:25 , `` A house divided against itself can not stand . \\nI believe this government can not endure \\tpermanently half slave and half free . \\nI do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the \\thouse to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided . \\nIt will become all one thing \\t, or all the other . '' \\nThe speech created a stark image \\tof the danger of disunion . \\nThe stage was then set for the election of the Illinois \\tlegislature which would , in turn , select Lincoln or Douglas . \\nWhen informed of Lincoln 's nomination , Douglas stated , `` [ Lincoln ] is the strong man \\tof the party ... and if I beat him , my victory will be hardly won . '' \\nThe Senate campaign featured seven \\tdebates between Lincoln and Douglas . \\nThese were the most famous political debates in American history ; they had \\tan atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands . \\nThe principals stood in stark \\tcontrast both physically and politically . \\nLincoln warned that Douglas ' `` Slave Power '' was threatening the values of republicanism , \\tand accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers ' premise that all men are created equal . \\nDouglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose \\twhether to allow slavery and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists . \\nLincoln 's argument assumed a moral tone , as \\the claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery . \\nDouglas 's argument was more legal , claiming that Lincoln was defying the \\tauthority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the `` Dred Scott '' decision . \\nThough the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the \\tDemocrats won more seats , and the legislature re-elected Douglas . \\nLincoln 's articulation of the issues \\tgave him a national political presence . \\nIn May 1859 , Lincoln purchased the `` Illinois Staats-Anzeiger '' , a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive \\t; most of the state 's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratically but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support . \\nIn the aftermath of the 1858 election , newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate \\t, rivaled by William H. Seward , Salmon P. Chase , Edward Bates , and Simon Cameron . \\nWhile Lincoln was popular in the Midwest , he lacked support \\tin the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek office . \\nIn January 1860 , Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the \\tnomination if offered , and in the following months ' several local papers endorsed his candidacy . \\nOver the coming months , Lincoln was tireless , \\tmaking nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail . \\nBy the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric , \\the quickly became the champion of the Republican party . \\nHowever , despite his overwhelming support in the Midwestern United \\tStates , he was less appreciated in the east . \\nHorace Greeley , editor of the New York Tribune , at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln 's compromising position \\ton slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court 's Dred-Scott ruling , which was promptly used against him by his political rivals . \\nOn February 27 , 1860 , powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union , in which he \\targued that the Founding Fathers of the United States had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery . \\nHe insisted that morality required opposition to slavery , and rejected any `` \\tgroping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong '' . \\nMany in the audience thought he \\tappeared awkward and even ugly . \\nBut Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership \\tthat brought him into contention . \\nJournalist Noah Brooks reported , `` No man ever before made such \\tan impression on his first appeal to a New York audience . '' \\nHistorian David Herbert Donald described the speech as `` \\ta superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant . \\nAppearing in Seward 's home state , sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase , \\tLincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination '' . \\nIn response to an inquiry about his ambitions , Lincoln said , \\t`` The taste `` is '' in my mouth a little . '' \\n1860 presidential \\telection . \\nOn May 9–10 , 1860 , the Illinois \\tRepublican State Convention was held in Decatur . \\nLincoln 's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis , Norman Judd \\t, Leonard Swett , and Jesse DuBois , and Lincoln received his first endorsement . \\nExploiting his embellished frontier legend ( clearing land and splitting fence rails ) \\t, Lincoln 's supporters adopted the label of `` The Rail Candidate '' . \\nIn 1860 , Lincoln described himself : `` I am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , \\tweighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes . '' \\nMichael Martinez wrote about the effective \\timaging of Lincoln by his campaign . \\nAt times he was presented as the plain-talking `` Rail Splitter '' and \\tat other times he was `` Honest Abe '' , unpolished but trustworthy . \\nOn May 18 , at the Republican National Convention in Chicago , Lincoln won \\tthe nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as Seward and Chase . \\nA former Democrat , Hannibal Hamlin of Maine , \\twas nominated for vice president to balance the ticket . \\nLincoln 's success depended on his campaign team , his reputation as a moderate on \\tthe slavery issue , and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff . \\nPennsylvania put him over the top , led by the state \\t's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support . \\nLincoln 's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln 's \\tdictate to `` Make no contracts that will bind me '' . \\nAs the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government , \\tmost Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party . \\nThroughout the 1850s , Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war \\t, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession . \\nWhen Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats , delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic \\tconvention ; they opposed Douglas 's position on popular sovereignty , and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate . \\nA group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the \\tConstitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee . \\nLincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North , \\twhile Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South . \\nPrior to the Republican convention , the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization , the Wide Awakes , which it used to \\tgenerate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives , thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties . \\nPeople of the Northern states knew the Southern states \\twould vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln . \\nAs Douglas and the other candidates campaigned , Lincoln gave no \\tspeeches , relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party . \\nThe party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and \\tproduced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials . \\nRepublican speakers focused first on the party platform , and second \\ton Lincoln 's life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty . \\nThe goal was to demonstrate the power of `` free labor '' , which allowed \\ta common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts . \\nThe Republican Party 's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a `` Chicago \\tTribune '' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln 's life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies . \\nThough he did not give public appearances , \\tmany sought to visit him and write him . \\nIn the runup to the election , he took an office in \\tthe Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention . \\nHe also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary \\t, who would remain in that role during the presidency . \\nOn November 6 , 1860 , \\tLincoln was elected the 16th president . \\nHe was the first Republican president and his victory was \\tentirely due to his support in the North and West . \\nNo ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states , and he won \\tonly two of 996 counties in all the Southern states , an omen of the impending Civil War . \\nLincoln received 1,866,452 votes , or 39.8 % of the total in a four-way \\trace , carrying the free Northern states , as well as California and Oregon . \\nHis victory in the Electoral College was decisive : \\tLincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents . \\nPresidency ( \\t1861–1865 ) . \\nSecession and \\tinauguration . \\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln 's election , and in response secessionists \\timplemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 . \\nOn December 20 , 1860 , South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by \\tFebruary 1 , 1861 , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas followed . \\nSix of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation \\t, the Confederate States of America , and adopted a constitution . \\nThe upper South and border states ( Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina \\t, Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , and Arkansas ) initially rejected the secessionist appeal . \\nPresident Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to \\trecognize the Confederacy , declaring secession illegal . \\nThe Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its \\tprovisional president on February 9 , 1861 . \\nAttempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed Crittenden \\tCompromise as contrary to the Party 's platform of free-soil in the territories . \\nLincoln said , `` I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks \\tlike buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right . '' \\nLincoln tacitly supported the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution , which passed \\tCongress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office . \\nThat doomed amendment would have protected slavery \\tin states where it already existed . \\nA few weeks before the war , Lincoln sent a letter to every \\tgovernor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution . \\nOn February 11 , 1861 , Lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address \\tupon leaving Springfield ; he would never again return to Springfield alive . \\nLincoln traveled east in \\ta special train . \\nDue to secessionist plots , a then-unprecedented attention to \\tsecurity was given to him and his train . \\nEn route to his inauguration , Lincoln \\taddressed crowds and legislatures across the North . \\nThe president-elect evaded suspected \\tassassins in Baltimore . \\nOn February 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in \\tWashington , D.C. , which was placed under substantial military guard . \\nLincoln directed his inaugural address to the South , proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states : Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key \\tsource of conflict between North and South , stating `` One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended , while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended . \\nThis is the only \\tsubstantial dispute . '' \\nThe president ended his address with an appeal to the people of \\tthe South : `` We are not enemies , but friends . \\nWe must not \\tbe enemies ... \\nThe mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , \\twill yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . '' \\nThe failure of the Peace Conference of \\t1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible . \\nBy March 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection \\thad proposed rejoining the Union on any terms . \\nMeanwhile , Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that \\tthe dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated . \\nIn his second inaugural address , Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said : `` Both parties deprecated war , but one of them \\twould make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . '' \\nCivil \\tWar . \\nMajor Robert Anderson , commander of the Union 's Fort Sumter in Charleston , South Carolina , sent a request for provisions \\tto Washington , and Lincoln 's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war . \\nOn April 12 , 1861 , Confederate forces fired on \\tUnion troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight . \\nHistorian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis \\t, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South , and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion . \\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was `` sadly disappointed '' at his failure to \\trealize that `` the country was sleeping on a volcano '' and that the South was preparing for war . \\nDonald concludes that , `` His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing \\ton Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood . \\nBut he also vowed not \\tto surrender the forts . \\nThe only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates \\tto fire the first shot ; they did just that . '' \\nOn April 15 , Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts , protect \\tWashington , and `` preserve the Union '' , which , in his view , remained intact despite the seceding states . \\nThis call forced states \\tto choose sides . \\nVirginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of Richmond as \\tthe Confederate capital , despite its exposure to Union lines . \\nNorth Carolina , Tennessee , and Arkansas \\tfollowed over the following two months . \\nSecession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland , \\tbut did not prevail ; Kentucky remained neutral . \\nThe Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of \\tthe Mason-Dixon line to defend the nation . \\nAs States sent Union regiments south , on April 19 , Baltimore mobs \\tin control of the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains . \\nLocal leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the \\tcapital and the Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials . \\nLincoln suspended the writ of `` habeas corpus '' where \\tneeded for the security of troops trying to reach Washington . \\nJohn Merryman , one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements , petitioned Supreme Court \\tChief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of `` habeas corpus . '' \\nIn June , in Ex parte Merryman , Taney , not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court , issued the writ \\t, believing that Article I , section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it . \\nBut Lincoln persisted with the policy \\tof suspension in select areas . \\nUnion military \\tstrategy . \\nLincoln took executive control of the war \\tand shaped the Union military strategy . \\nHe responded to the unprecedented political and military \\tcrisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority . \\nHe expanded his war powers , imposed a blockade on Confederate ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by \\tCongress , suspended `` habeas corpus '' , and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers . \\nLincoln gained the support of Congress and \\tthe northern public for these actions . \\nLincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave \\tstates and keep the war from becoming an international conflict . \\nIt was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success , and that any compromise alienated \\tfactions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions . \\nCopperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing \\tto compromise on slavery . \\nThe Radical Republicans criticized him for \\tmoving too slowly in abolishing slavery . \\nOn August 6 , 1861 , Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judicial \\tproceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates . \\nThe law had little practical effect , but \\tit signaled political support for abolishing slavery . \\nIn August 1861 , General John C. Frémont , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee \\t, without consulting Washington , issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels . \\nLincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as \\tpolitically motivated and lacking military necessity . \\nAs a result , Union enlistments from Maryland , \\tKentucky , and Missouri increased by over 40,000 . \\nInternationally , Lincoln wanted to forestall \\tforeign military aid to the Confederacy . \\nHe relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while \\tworking closely with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner . \\nIn the 1861 Trent Affair which threatened war with Great Britain , the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship , \\tthe `` Trent '' , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered . \\nLincoln ended the crisis by \\treleasing the two diplomats . \\nBiographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln 's successful techniques : Lincoln \\tpainstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department . \\nHe tracked all phases of the effort , consulting with governors , and \\tselecting generals based on their success , their state , and their party . \\nIn January 1862 , after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the \\tWar Department , Lincoln replaced War Secretary Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton . \\nStanton centralized the War Department 's activities , auditing and \\tcanceling contracts , saving the federal government $ 17,000,000 . \\nStanton was a staunch Unionist , pro-business , conservative \\tDemocrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction . \\nHe worked more often and more closely \\twith Lincoln than any other senior official . \\n`` Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war \\ttogether '' , say Thomas and Hyman . \\nLincoln 's war strategy embraced two priorities : ensuring that Washington was well-defended \\tand conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt , decisive victory . \\nTwice a week , Lincoln met \\twith his cabinet in the afternoon . \\nOccasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage \\tride , concerned that he was working too hard . \\nFor his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General Henry Halleck entitled `` \\tElements of Military Art and Science '' ; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini . \\nLincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control \\tstrategic points , such as the Mississippi River . \\nLincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of \\tdefeating the enemy 's army , rather than merely capturing territory . \\nIn directing the Union 's war strategy , Lincoln valued the advice of Gen. Winfield \\tScott , even after his retirement as Commanding General of the United States Army . \\nOn June 23–24 , 1862 , President Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point , where he spent \\tfive hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department . \\nGeneral \\tMcClellan . \\nAfter the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott 's \\tretirement , Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief . \\nMcClellan then took months to \\tplan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign . \\nMcClellan 's slow progress frustrated Lincoln , as did his \\tposition that no troops were needed to defend Washington . \\nMcClellan , in turn , blamed the failure of the \\tcampaign on Lincoln 's reservation of troops for the capitol . \\nIn 1862 , Lincoln removed McClellan \\tfor the general 's continued inaction . \\nHe elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed John \\tPope as head of the new Army of Virginia . \\nPope satisfied Lincoln 's desire to advance on Richmond \\tfrom the north , thus protecting Washington from counterattack . \\nBut Pope was then soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the \\tsummer of 1862 , forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington . \\nDespite his dissatisfaction with McClellan 's failure to reinforce Pope , \\tLincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington . \\nTwo days after McClellan 's return to command , General Robert E. Lee 's \\tforces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland , leading to the Battle of Antietam . \\nThat battle , a Union victory , was among the bloodiest in \\tAmerican history ; it facilitated Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation in January . \\nMcClellan then resisted the president 's demand that he pursue Lee 's withdrawing army , while General Don \\tCarlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee . \\nLincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans ; and after the \\t1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside . \\nThe appointments were both politically neutral \\tand adroit on Lincoln 's part . \\nBurnside , against presidential advice , launched an offensive across the \\tRappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December . \\nDesertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased \\tafter Fredericksburg , so Lincoln replaced Burnside with Joseph Hooker . \\nIn the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation , high taxes , rumors of corruption , suspension \\tof `` habeas corpus '' , military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market . \\nThe Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest , but cost votes \\tin the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest , where many Southerners had lived for generations . \\nIn the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near ; the \\tplans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond , Rosecrans on Chattanooga , Grant on Vicksburg , and a naval assault on Charleston . \\nHooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in \\tMay , then resigned and was replaced by George Meade . \\nMeade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg \\tCampaign , but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln 's demands . \\nAt the same time , Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control \\tof the Mississippi River , splitting the far western rebel states . \\nEmancipation \\tProclamation . \\nThe Federal government 's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution , \\twhich before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states . \\nLincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented , because these territories \\twould be admitted to the Union as free states , and free states would come to outnumber slave states . \\nHe sought to persuade the states to \\tagree to compensation for emancipating their slaves . \\nLincoln rejected Major General John C. Frémont 's August 1861 emancipation attempt , as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May \\t1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede . \\nIn June 1862 , Congress passed an act banning \\tslavery on all federal territory , which Lincoln signed . \\nIn July , the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted , providing court procedures to free the slaves of \\tthose convicted of aiding the rebellion ; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional . \\nHe felt such action could be taken only within the war \\tpowers of the commander-in-chief , which he planned to exercise . \\nLincoln at this time reviewed a draft \\tof the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet . \\nPrivately , Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy \\t's slave base had to be eliminated . \\nCopperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification ; \\tRepublican editor Horace Greeley of the `` New York Tribune '' agreed . \\nIn a letter of August 22 , 1862 , Lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free , regardless of that , his first obligation as president was to preserve the \\tUnion : On September 22 , 1862 , Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation , which announced that , in states still in rebellion on January 1 , 1863 , the slaves would be freed . \\nHe kept his word and , on January 1 , 1863 , issued the Emancipation Proclamation , freeing the \\tslaves in 10 states not then under Union control , with exemptions specified for areas under such control . \\nLincoln 's comment on signing the Proclamation was : `` I never , in my life , \\tfelt more certain that I was doing right , than I do in signing this paper . '' \\nHe spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while \\tDemocrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites . \\nWith the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective \\t, Union armies advancing south liberated all three million slaves in the Confederacy . \\nThe Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be `` received into the armed \\tservice of the United States , '' enlisting these freedmen became official policy . \\nBy the spring of 1863 , Lincoln was ready \\tto recruit black troops in more than token numbers . \\nIn a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , Lincoln wrote , `` \\tThe bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once '' . \\nBy the end of 1863 , at Lincoln 's direction , General \\tLorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley . \\nGettysburg Address ( \\t1863 ) . \\nLincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg \\tbattlefield cemetery on November 19 , 1863 . \\nIn 272 words , and three minutes , Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789 , but \\tin 1776 , `` conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal '' . \\nHe defined the war as dedicated to the \\tprinciples of liberty and equality for all . \\nHe declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end , and the future of democracy \\twould be assured , that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth '' . \\nDefying his prediction that `` the world will little note , nor long remember what \\twe say here '' , the Address became the most quoted speech in American history . \\nPromoting General \\tGrant . \\nGeneral Ulysses Grant 's victories at the Battle of \\tShiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln . \\nResponding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh , Lincoln had \\tsaid , `` I ca n't spare this man . \\nHe fights \\t. '' \\nWith Grant in command , Lincoln felt the Union Army could \\tadvance in multiple theaters , while also including black troops . \\nMeade 's failure to capture Lee 's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity \\tof the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander . \\nGrant then assumed command \\tof Meade 's army . \\nLincoln was concerned that Grant might be \\tconsidering a presidential candidacy in 1864 . \\nHe arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant 's political intentions , and once assured that he had none , \\tLincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General , a rank which had been unoccupied since George Washington . \\nAuthorization for such a promotion `` with the advice and consent of the Senate '' was provided by \\ta new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant 's name to the Senate . \\nHis nomination was confirmed by the \\tSenate on March 2 , 1864 . \\nGrant in 1864 waged the bloody Overland Campaign \\t, which exacted heavy losses on both sides . \\nWhen Lincoln asked what Grant 's plans were , the persistent general replied , `` \\tI propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . '' \\nGrant 's army \\tmoved steadily south . \\nLincoln traveled to Grant 's headquarters at City Point , \\tVirginia , to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman . \\nLincoln reacted to Union losses by \\tmobilizing support throughout the North . \\nLincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations , railroads , and \\tbridges—hoping to weaken the South 's morale and fighting ability . \\nHe emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction \\t( which was considerable ) for its own sake . \\nLincoln 's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington , D.C. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position \\t, Union Captain ( and future Supreme Court Justice ) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. shouted at him , `` Get down , you damn fool , before you get shot ! '' \\nAs Grant continued to weaken Lee 's \\tforces , efforts to discuss peace began . \\nConfederate Vice President Stephens led a group meeting with \\tLincoln , Seward , and others at Hampton Roads . \\nLincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal \\t; his objective to end the fighting was not realized . \\nOn April 1 , 1865 , Grant \\tnearly encircled Petersburg in a siege . \\nThe Confederate government evacuated Richmond and \\tLincoln visited the conquered capital . \\nOn April 9 , Lee surrendered to Grant \\tat Appomattox , officially ending the war . \\nReelection \\t. \\nLincoln ran for reelection in 1864 , while uniting the main Republican \\tfactions , along with War Democrats Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson . \\nLincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build \\tsupport and fend off the Radicals ' efforts to replace him . \\nAt its convention , the Republicans \\tselected Johnson as his running mate . \\nTo broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans \\t, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party . \\nGrant 's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln 's re-election \\tprospects , and many Republicans feared defeat . \\nLincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over \\tthe White House ; Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet , but asked them to sign the sealed envelope . \\nThe pledge read as follows : The Democratic platform followed the `` Peace wing '' of the party and called \\tthe war a `` failure '' ; but their candidate , McClellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform . \\nMeanwhile , Lincoln emboldened Grant with \\tmore troops and Republican party support . \\nSherman 's capture of Atlanta in September and \\tDavid Farragut 's capture of Mobile ended defeatism . \\nThe Democratic Party was deeply split , with \\tsome leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln . \\nThe National Union Party was united \\tby Lincoln 's support for emancipation . \\nState Republican parties stressed the \\tperfidy of the Copperheads . \\nOn November 8 , Lincoln carried all but three \\tstates , including 78 percent of Union soldiers . \\nOn March 4 , 1865 , \\tLincoln delivered his second inaugural address . \\nIn it , he deemed the war \\tcasualties to be God 's will . \\nHistorian Mark Noll places the speech `` among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which \\tAmericans conceive their place in the world ; '' it is inscribed in the Lincoln Memorial . \\nLincoln said \\t: Reconstruction . \\nReconstruction preceded the war 's end , as Lincoln and his associates considered the \\treintegration of the nation , and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves . \\nWhen a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be \\ttreated , Lincoln replied , `` Let 'em up easy . '' \\nLincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath \\t, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states . \\nHis main goal was to keep the union together , so he proceeded by focusing \\tnot on whom to blame , but on how to rebuild the nation as one . \\nLincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals , under Rep. Thaddeus \\tStevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade , who otherwise remained Lincoln 's allies . \\nDetermined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South , \\tLincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held . \\nHis Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate \\tcivil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners , if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance . \\nAs Southern states fell , they needed \\tleaders while their administrations were restored . \\nIn Tennessee and Arkansas , Lincoln respectively appointed \\tJohnson and Frederick Steele as military governors . \\nIn Louisiana , Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood \\twhen 10 percent of the voters agreed , and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery . \\nDemocratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to \\tensure his and the Republicans ' political aspirations . \\nThe Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their \\town plan , the 1864 Wade–Davis Bill , which Lincoln vetoed . \\nThe Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected \\trepresentatives from Louisiana , Arkansas , and Tennessee . \\nLincoln 's appointments were designed to \\tharness both moderates and Radicals . \\nTo fill Chief Justice Taney 's seat on the Supreme Court , he named the Radicals ' \\tchoice , Salmon P. Chase , who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies . \\nAfter implementing the Emancipation Proclamation , Lincoln increased pressure on Congress \\tto outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment . \\nHe declared that such an amendment would `` clinch the whole matter \\t'' and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress . \\nThis first attempt fell short of the required \\ttwo-thirds majority in the House of Representatives . \\nPassage became part of Lincoln 's reelection platform , and after his successful reelection \\t, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31 , 1865 . \\nWith ratification , it became the Thirteenth Amendment to \\tthe United States Constitution on December 6 , 1865 . \\nLincoln believed the federal government had limited \\tresponsibility to the millions of freedmen . \\nHe signed Senator Charles Sumner 's Freedmen 's Bureau bill that set up \\ta temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves . \\nThe law opened land for a lease of three years \\twith the ability to purchase title for the freedmen . \\nLincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control \\t, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists . \\nHistorians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly \\thow Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived . \\nBiographers James G. Randall and Richard Current , according to David Lincove \\t, argue that : Eric Foner argues that : Native Americans . \\nLincoln 's experience with Native Americans started early with their \\tkilling of his grandfather in front of the family . \\nLater he served as a Captain in the state \\tmilitia during the Black Hawk War seeing no combat . \\nDuring his presidency , his policy \\ttoward Indians was based on politics . \\nHe used appointments to the Indian Bureau as \\ta reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin . \\nWhile in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers \\t, railroads , and telegraphs , from Indian attacks . \\nOn August 17 , 1862 , the Sioux \\tor Dakota uprising broke out in Minnesota . \\nHundreds of settlers were killed , 30,000 were displaced \\tfrom their homes , and Washington was deeply alarmed . \\nSome feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate \\tconspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier . \\nLincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war \\tsent by railroad to put down the uprising . \\nWhen the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians , \\tLincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in Minnesota . \\nLincoln sent General John Pope to Minnesota as commander of the new \\tDepartment of the Northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities . \\nBefore he arrived the Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa sent Lincoln a letter begging to go to war \\tfor the United States against the Sioux , so Lincoln could send Minnesota 's troops to fight the south . \\nShortly after , a Mille Lacs Band \\tChief offered the same at St . \\nCloud , \\tMinnesota . \\nIn it the Chippewa specified that they wanted \\tto use the indigenous rules of warfare . \\nThat meant there would be no prisoners of \\twar , no surrender , no peace agreement . \\nLincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer , as he had no means to control \\tthe outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare . \\nOnce word reached the other bands of Chippewa , he had no way of knowing \\thow they would react to his sending the Fond Du Lac on the warpath . \\nOne of the Chippewa signing the letter , Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub , \\thad received a Presidential medal from Lincoln earlier in the year . \\nServing under Gen. Pope was \\tMinnesota Congressman Henry H. Sibley . \\nMinnesota 's Governor had made Sibley a Colonel United States Volunteers to command the US force tasked with \\tfighting the war and that eventually defeated Little Crow 's forces at the Battle of Wood Lake . \\nThe day the Mdewakanton force surrendered at Camp Release , a Chippewa war council met \\tat Minnesota 's capitol with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln , to fight the Sioux . \\nSibley ordered a military commission to review that actions of \\tthe captured to try those that had committed war crimes . \\nThe legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants \\thad been established during the Mexican War . \\nSibley thought he had 16-20 of men he wanted for trial \\twhile Gen. Pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried . \\nWhen it was done , 303 had been given \\tdeath sentences that were subject to Presidential review . \\nLincoln ordered Gen Pope send all of the trial transcripts Washington \\twhere he and two of his staff poured over the trials . \\nThe lawyer in \\tLincoln saw issues . \\nHe slowly realized that the trials could be divided into \\ttwo groups : combat between combatants and combat against civilians . \\nThe groups could be identified by their transcripts , the first group were all just three \\tpages in length while the second group had more pages , some up to twelve . \\nHe placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted \\ttheir sentences for the largest mass commutation in history . \\nInto the second \\tgroup went forty . \\nOne he commuted for \\tturning state 's witness . \\nAnother Sibley dismissed when overwhelming \\tproof surfaced exonerating the man . \\nThe remaining 38 were executed in the \\tlargest mass hanging in US history . \\nVery quickly questions arose concerning three of \\tthe executions that have not been answered . \\nLess than four months after the executions Lincoln issued General Order 100 \\tthat relates more to the Minnesota War than the Civil War . \\nNow a Congressman , Alexander Ramsey told Lincoln , in 1864 , that he would \\thave gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton . \\nLincoln responded , `` I could not \\tafford to hang men for votes . '' \\nThe men whose sentences he commuted were sent \\tto a military prison at Davenport , Iowa . \\nA few of those he had released due \\tto the efforts of Bishop Henry Whipple . \\nWhig theory of \\ta presidency . \\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on \\texecuting laws while deferring to Congress ' responsibility for legislating . \\nLincoln vetoed only four bills , including the \\tWade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program . \\nThe 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of \\tWestern government-held land available for purchase at low cost . \\nThe 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government \\tgrants for agricultural colleges in each state . \\nThe Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction \\tof the United States ' first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 1869 . \\nThe passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the \\tabsence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s . \\nIn the selection and use of his cabinet , Lincoln employed the \\tstrengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency . \\nLincoln commented on his thought process , `` We need \\tthe strongest men of the party in the Cabinet . \\nWe needed to hold \\tour own people together . \\nI had looked the party over and concluded \\tthat these were the very strongest men . \\nThen I had no right to deprive \\tthe country of their services . '' \\nGoodwin described the group in her biography \\tas a `` Team of Rivals '' . \\nThere were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government : tariffs \\t( a policy with long precedent ) , and a Federal income tax . \\nIn 1861 , Lincoln signed the second and third \\tMorrill Tariffs , following the first enacted by Buchanan . \\nHe also signed the Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income \\ttax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $ 800 ( ) . \\nThe Revenue Act of 1862 adopted \\trates that increased with income . \\nThe Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the \\tfederal government 's economic influence in other areas . \\nThe National Banking Act created \\tthe system of national banks . \\nThe US issued paper currency for the first time , \\tknown as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side . \\nIn 1862 , Congress created \\tthe Department of Agriculture . \\nIn response to rumors of a renewed draft , the editors of the `` New York World '' and the `` Journal \\tof Commerce '' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market . \\nLincoln attacked the media for such behavior , and ordered a \\tmilitary seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days . \\nLincoln is largely responsible \\tfor the Thanksgiving holiday . \\nThanksgiving had become a regional holiday in \\tNew England in the 17th century . \\nIt had been sporadically proclaimed by \\tthe federal government on irregular dates . \\nThe prior proclamation had been during James \\tMadison 's presidency 50 years earlier . \\nIn 1863 , Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November \\tof that year to be a day of Thanksgiving . \\nIn June 1864 , Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress , which \\tprovided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park . \\nSupreme Court \\tappointments . \\nLincoln 's philosophy on court nominations was that `` we can not ask a man what he will do \\t, and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it . \\nTherefore we must take a man \\twhose opinions are known . '' \\nLincoln made five appointments \\tto the Supreme Court . \\nNoah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer \\twho was committed to the Union . \\nSamuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the \\t1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist . \\nDavid Davis was Lincoln 's campaign manager in 1860 and had served \\tas a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced . \\nDemocrat Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme \\tCourt justice , provided geographic and political balance . \\nFinally , Lincoln 's Treasury Secretary , \\tSalmon P. Chase , became Chief Justice . \\nLincoln believed Chase was an able jurist , would support Reconstruction \\tlegislation , and that his appointment united the Republican Party . \\nForeign \\tpolicy . \\nLincoln named his main political rival William H. Seward as Secretary \\tof State , and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio . \\nHowever Lincoln did select some of the top \\tdiplomats as part of his patronage policy . \\nHe also closely watched the handling of the `` Trent '' Affair in late \\t1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with Britain . \\nSeward 's main role was to keep \\tBritain and France from supporting the Confederacy . \\nHe was successful after indicating to London and Paris that \\tWashington would declare war on them if they supported Richmond . \\nAssassination \\t. \\nJohn Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland ; though \\the never joined the Confederate army , he had contacts with the Confederate secret service . \\nAfter attending an April 11 , 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting \\trights for blacks , Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President . \\nWhen Booth learned of the Lincolns ' intent to attend a play with General \\tGrant , he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford 's Theatre . \\nLincoln and his wife attended the play `` Our American Cousin '' on the evening of \\tApril 14 , just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse . \\nAt the last minute , Grant decided to go to New \\tJersey to visit his children instead of attending the play . \\nOn April 14 , 1865 , hours before he was assassinated , Lincoln signed legislation establishing the United States Secret Service , and , at 10:15 in the evening \\t, Booth entered the back of Lincoln 's theater box , crept up from behind , and fired at the back of Lincoln 's head , mortally wounding him . \\nLincoln 's guest , Major Henry Rathbone , momentarily grappled \\twith Booth , but Booth stabbed him and escaped . \\nAfter being attended by Doctor Charles Leale and two other doctors \\t, Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House . \\nAfter remaining in a coma for eight hours , Lincoln \\tdied at 7:22 in the morning on April 15 . \\nStanton saluted and said , `` Now \\the belongs to the ages . '' \\nLincoln 's body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin , which was loaded \\tinto a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers . \\nPresident Johnson was sworn in \\tlater that same day . \\nTwo weeks later , Booth , refusing to surrender , was tracked to a farm in \\tVirginia , and was mortally shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett and died on April 26 . \\nSecretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken \\talive , so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed . \\nAfter a brief interview , Stanton declared \\thim a patriot and dismissed the charge . \\nFuneral and \\tburial . \\nThe late President lay in state , first in the East Room of the White \\tHouse , and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21 . \\nThe caskets containing Lincoln 's body and the body of his son Willie \\ttraveled for three weeks on the `` Lincoln Special '' funeral train . \\nThe train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield , Illinois \\t, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands . \\nMany others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with \\tbands , bonfires , and hymn singing or in silent grief . \\nPoet Walt Whitman composed `` When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd \\t'' to eulogize him , one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln . \\nAfrican Americans were especially moved ; they \\thad lost their `` Moses '' . \\nIn a larger sense , the reaction was in response \\tto the deaths of so many men in the war . \\nHistorians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but \\tnoted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death . \\nLincoln 's body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery \\tin Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb . \\nReligious and \\tphilosophical beliefs . \\nAs a young man , \\tLincoln was a religious skeptic . \\nHe was deeply familiar with the \\tBible , quoting and praising it . \\nHe was private about his position on organized \\treligion and respected the beliefs of others . \\nHe never made a clear \\tprofession of Christian beliefs . \\nThroughout his public career , \\tLincoln often quoted Scripture . \\nHis three most famous speeches—the House Divided Speech , the Gettysburg Address , \\tand his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to Providence and quotes from Scripture . \\nIn the 1840s , Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity , \\ta belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power . \\nWith the death of his son Edward in 1850 \\the more frequently expressed a dependence on God . \\nHe never joined a church , although he frequently attended \\tFirst Presbyterian Church with his wife beginning in 1852 . \\nIn the 1850s , Lincoln asserted his belief in `` providence '' in a general way , and rarely used the \\tlanguage or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence . \\nThe death of his son Willie in February 1862 may \\thave caused him to look toward religion for solace . \\nAfter Willie 's death , he questioned the \\tdivine necessity of the war 's severity . \\nHe wrote at this time that God `` could have \\teither saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest . \\nYet the \\tcontest began . \\nAnd having begun , He could give the \\tfinal victory to either side any day . \\nYet the contest \\tproceeds . '' \\nLincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events \\tand by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches . \\nBy the end of the war , he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events , writing on April 4 , 1864 , to a newspaper editor in Kentucky : This spirituality can best be \\tseen in his second inaugural address , considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in American history , and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech , or one of them at the very least . \\nLincoln explains therein that the cause , purpose , \\tand result of the war was God 's will . \\nLincoln 's frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his \\town personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences , who were mostly evangelical Protestants . \\nOn the day Lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told \\this wife he desired to visit the Holy Land . \\nHealth \\t. \\nLincoln is believed to have had \\tdepression , smallpox , and malaria . \\nHe took blue mass pills , which \\tcontained mercury , to treat constipation . \\nIt is unknown to what extent that \\tmight have resulted in mercury poisoning . \\nSeveral claims have been made that Lincoln \\t's health was declining before the assassination . \\nThese are often based on photographs of Lincoln \\tappearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting . \\nIt is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic \\tdisease such as Marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B . \\nLegacy \\t. \\nRepublican \\tvalues . \\nLincoln 's redefinition of `` republican values '' has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick \\tDiggins , Harry V. Jaffa , Vernon Burton , Eric Foner , and Herman J. Belz . \\nLincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for \\tall—the `` sheet anchor '' of republicanism beginning in the 1850s . \\nHe did this at a time when the Constitution , which `` \\ttolerated slavery '' , was the focus of most political discourse . \\nDiggins notes , `` Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution \\tto the theory and destiny of republicanism itself '' in the 1860 Cooper Union speech . \\nInstead of focusing on the legality of an argument \\t, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism . \\nHis position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a \\tcontract among the states , and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract . \\nFurthermore , it was a national duty to \\tensure the republic stands in every state . \\nMany soldiers and religious leaders from the north , though , felt the fight \\tfor liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs . \\nAs a Whig activist , Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high \\ttariffs , banks , infrastructure improvements , and railroads , in opposition to Jacksonian democrats . \\nLincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man , but he \\tdisagreed with the Jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise . \\nNevertheless , Lincoln admired Andrew Jackson 's \\tsteeliness as well as his patriotism . \\nAccording to historian Sean Wilentz : William C. Harris found that Lincoln 's `` reverence for the Founding Fathers , the \\tConstitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism . '' \\nJames G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation `` in his preference for orderly progress , \\this distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform . '' \\nRandall concludes that `` he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism ' which involved abuse of the South , \\thatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders . '' \\nReunification of \\tthe states . \\nIn Lincoln 's first inaugural address , \\the explored the nature of democracy . \\nHe denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that \\tmajority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints . \\nHe said `` A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with \\tdeliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . '' \\nThe successful reunification of the states had \\tconsequences for how people viewed the country . \\nThe term `` the United States '' has historically been used sometimes in the \\tplural ( `` these United States '' ) and other times in the singular . \\nThe Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance \\tof the singular usage by the end of the 19th century . \\nHistorical \\treputation . \\nIn surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 , the top three presidents \\tare Lincoln , Washington , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt , although the order varies . \\nBetween 1999 and 2011 , Lincoln , John F. Kennedy , and Ronald Reagan \\thave been the top-ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys , according to Gallup . \\nA 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked \\tLincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington . \\nLincoln 's assassination left \\thim a national martyr . \\nHe was viewed by abolitionists as \\ta champion of human liberty . \\nRepublicans linked Lincoln 's \\tname to their party . \\nMany , though not all , in the South \\tconsidered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability . \\nHistorians have said he was `` a \\tclassical liberal '' in the 19th-century sense . \\nAllen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a `` classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy , a friend to trade and business as ennobling \\tand enabling , and an American counterpart to Mill , Cobden , and Bright '' , whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office . \\nSociologist Barry Schwartz argues that Lincoln 's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era \\t( 1900–1920s ) , when he emerged as one of America 's most venerated heroes , even among white Southerners . \\nThe high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. Union nationalism , \\tas envisioned by Lincoln , `` helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt . '' \\nIn the New Deal era , liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war \\tpresident , but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state . \\nSchwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred \\tand provided the nation with `` a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life . '' \\nDuring the Great Depression , he argues , Lincoln served `` as a means for seeing \\tthe world 's disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful . '' \\nFranklin D. Roosevelt , preparing America for war , used the words of \\tthe Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan . \\nAmericans asked , `` What \\twould Lincoln do ? '' \\nHowever , Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln 's symbolic power has lost \\trelevance , and this `` fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness . '' \\nHe suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism \\thave diluted greatness as a concept . \\nIn the Cold War years , Lincoln 's image shifted to a \\tsymbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes . \\nHe had long been known as the Great Emancipator , but , by the late 1960s , \\tsome African American intellectuals , led by Lerone Bennett Jr. , denied that Lincoln deserved that title . \\nBennett won wide attention when he called \\tLincoln a white supremacist in 1968 . \\nHe noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs \\tand told jokes that ridiculed blacks . \\nBennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed \\tthat freed slaves voluntarily move to another country . \\nThe emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves \\tfrom slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them . \\nDefenders of Lincoln , such as authors Dirck and Cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his \\tday and that he was a `` moral visionary '' who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible . \\nDirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett seriously , \\tpointing to his `` narrow political agenda and faulty research '' . \\nBy the 1970s , Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neo-Confederates such as Mel Bradford , who denounced his treatment of the white South—for his intense nationalism , his support for business \\t, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery , his acting on Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers . \\nLincoln became a favorite of \\tliberal intellectuals across the world . \\nBarry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln 's image suffered `` erosion \\t, fading prestige , benign ridicule '' in the late 20th century . \\nOn the other hand , Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet \\tJohn Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were `` content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason '' . \\nIn the 21st century , President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite \\tpresident and insisted on using the Lincoln Bible for his inaugural ceremonies . \\nLincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood \\t, almost always in a flattering light . \\nMemory and \\tmemorials . \\nLincoln 's portrait appears on two denominations of United States \\tcurrency , the penny and the $ 5 bill . \\nHis likeness also appears \\ton many postage stamps . \\nWhile he is usually portrayed bearded , he did not grow \\ta beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell . \\nHe was the first of \\tfive presidents to do so . \\nHe has been memorialized in many town , city , \\tand county names , including the capital of Nebraska . \\nThe United States Navy is named after Lincoln , \\tthe second Navy ship to bear his name . \\nThe Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nation 's capital \\tand is one of the top five visited National Park Service sites in the country . \\nFord 's Theatre , among the top sites in Washington , D.C. \\t, is across the street from Petersen House , where Lincoln died . \\nMemorials in Springfield , Illinois , include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential \\tLibrary and Museum , Lincoln 's home , and his tomb . \\nA portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents \\ton Mount Rushmore , which receives about 3 million visitors a year . \\nAn stands in Lincoln Park Chicago , with recastings

< doc id= '' 308 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=308 '' title= '' Aristotle '' > Aristotle Aristotle \\t( ; `` Aristotélēs '' , ; 384–322 BC ) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece . \\nTaught by Plato , he was the founder of the Peripatetic \\tschool of philosophy within the Lyceum and the wider Aristotelian tradition . \\nHis writings cover many subjects including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry \\t, theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics , meteorology , geology , and government . \\nAristotle provided a complex synthesis of the \\tvarious philosophies existing prior to him . \\nIt was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its \\tintellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry . \\nAs a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of \\tknowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion . \\nLittle is known \\tabout his life . \\nAristotle was born in the city \\tof Stagira in Northern Greece . \\nHis father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a \\tchild , and he was brought up by a guardian . \\nAt seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato 's Academy \\tin Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( ) . \\nShortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip \\tII of Macedon , tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC . \\nHe established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to \\tproduce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls . \\nThough Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication , only around a \\tthird of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication . \\nAristotle 's views profoundly \\tshaped medieval scholarship . \\nThe influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance \\t, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed . \\nSome of Aristotle 's zoological observations found in his biology , such as on the \\thectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were disbelieved until the 19th century . \\nHe also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages , as well as Christian theology , \\tespecially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church . \\nAristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as `` The First Teacher '' , and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas \\tas simply `` The Philosopher '' , while the poet Dante called him `` the master of those who know '' . \\nHis works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , and \\twere studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan . \\nAristotle 's influence on logic continued \\twell into the 19th century . \\nIn addition , his ethics , though always influential , \\tgained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . \\nAristotle has been called the father of logic , biology , political science , zoology , embryology , natural \\tlaw , scientific method , rhetoric , psychology , realism , criticism , individualism , teleology , and meteorology . \\nLife \\t. \\nIn general , the details of \\tAristotle 's life are not well-established . \\nThe biographies written in ancient times are often speculative \\tand historians only agree on a few salient points . \\nAristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira , Chalcidice , \\tabout 55 km ( 34 miles ) east of modern-day Thessaloniki . \\nHis father , Nicomachus , was the \\tpersonal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon . \\nWhile he was young , Aristotle learned about biology and \\tmedical information , which was taught by his father . \\nBoth of Aristotle 's parents died when he was about \\tthirteen , and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . \\nAlthough little information about Aristotle 's childhood has survived , he probably spent some \\ttime within the Macedonian palace , making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy . \\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen , Aristotle moved \\tto Athens to continue his education at Plato 's Academy . \\nHe probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at \\tthe Eleusinian Mysteries , `` to experience is to learn '' [ παθείν μαθεĩν ] . \\nAristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty \\tyears before leaving in 348/47 BC . \\nThe traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy 's direction after control passed to Plato 's nephew \\tSpeusippus , although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died . \\nAristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of \\this friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor . \\nAfter the death of Hermias , Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos \\t, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon . \\nWhile in Lesbos , Aristotle married Pythias , \\teither Hermias 's adoptive daughter or niece . \\nShe bore him a daughter , \\twhom they also named Pythias . \\nIn 343 BC , Aristotle was invited by Philip II \\tof Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander . \\nAristotle was appointed as the head \\tof the royal academy of Macedon . \\nDuring Aristotle 's time in the Macedonian court , he gave lessons not only \\tto Alexander but also to two other future kings : Ptolemy and Cassander . \\nAristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest , and Aristotle \\t's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric . \\nIn one famous example , he counsels Alexander to be `` a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians , \\tto look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants '' . \\nBy 335 BC , Aristotle had returned to Athens , \\testablishing his own school there known as the Lyceum . \\nAristotle conducted courses at the school \\tfor the next twelve years . \\nWhile in Athens , his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of \\tStagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , Nicomachus . \\nIf the `` Suda '' an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages is accurate \\t, he may also have had an `` erômenos '' , Palaephatus of Abydus . \\nThis period in Athens , between 335 and 323 BC , is \\twhen Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works . \\nHe wrote many dialogues , of \\twhich only fragments have survived . \\nThose works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part \\t, intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students . \\nHis most important treatises include `` Physics '' , `` Metaphysics '' , `` Nicomachean Ethics \\t'' , `` Politics '' , `` On the Soul '' and `` Poetics '' . \\nAristotle studied and made significant contributions to `` logic , metaphysics , mathematics , physics , biology \\t, botany , ethics , politics , agriculture , medicine , dance , and theatre . '' \\nNear the end of his life , Alexander and Aristotle \\tbecame estranged over Alexander 's relationship with Persia and Persians . \\nA widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander 's death , but \\tthe only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death . \\nFollowing Alexander 's death , anti-Macedonian \\tsentiment in Athens was rekindled . \\nIn 322 BC , Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety , prompting him to flee to his mother 's family estate in Chalcis , on Euboea , at which \\toccasion he was said to have stated : `` I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy '' – a reference to Athens 's trial and execution of Socrates . \\nHe died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student Antipater as \\this chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife . \\nSpeculative \\tphilosophy . \\nLogic \\t. \\nWith the `` Prior Analytics '' , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , \\tand his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic . \\nKant stated in the `` Critique of Pure Reason \\t'' that with Aristotle logic reached its completion . \\n`` Organon \\t'' . \\nWhat is today called `` Aristotelian logic '' with its types of syllogism ( \\tmethods of logical argument ) , Aristotle himself would have labelled `` analytics '' . \\nThe term `` logic '' he \\treserved to mean `` dialectics '' . \\nMost of Aristotle 's work is probably not in its original form \\t, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers . \\nThe logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the \\t`` Organon '' around 40 BC by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers . \\nThe books are : The order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are \\tcomposed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle 's writings . \\nIt goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the `` Categories , '' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in `` On Interpretation '' , to \\tthe study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the `` Analytics '' ) and dialectics ( in the `` Topics '' and `` Sophistical Refutations '' ) . \\nThe first three treatises form the core of the logical theory `` stricto sensu '' \\t: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning . \\nThe `` Rhetoric '' is not conventionally included , but \\tit states that it relies on the `` Topics '' . \\nMetaphysics \\t. \\nThe word `` metaphysics '' appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled \\tvarious small selections of Aristotle 's works to the treatise we know by the name `` Metaphysics '' . \\nAristotle called it `` first philosophy '' , and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science ( physics ) \\tas the contemplative ( `` theoretikē '' ) philosophy which is `` theological '' and studies the divine . \\nHe wrote in his `` Metaphysics \\t'' ( 1026a16 ) : Substance . \\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance ( `` ousia '' ) and essence ( `` to ti ên einai '' , `` the what it was to be '' ) in \\this `` Metaphysics '' ( Book VII ) , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hylomorphism . \\nIn Book VIII , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as \\tthe substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed . \\nFor example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers , etc. , or whatever constitutes the `` potential '' house , while the form \\tof the substance is the `` actual '' house , namely 'covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house . \\nThe formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , \\tand the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form . \\nImmanent \\trealism . \\nLike his teacher Plato , Aristotle \\t's philosophy aims at the universal . \\nAristotle 's ontology places the universal ( `` katholou '' ) in particulars ( `` kath ' hekaston '' ) \\t, things in the world , whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate . \\nFor Aristotle , `` form '' is still what phenomena are based \\ton , but is `` instantiated '' in a particular substance . \\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form , which \\tcould be either a property or a relation to other things . \\nWhen one looks at an apple , for example , one sees an \\tapple , and one can also analyse a form of an apple . \\nIn this distinction , there is a particular \\tapple and a universal form of an apple . \\nMoreover , one can place an apple next to a book , so that one \\tcan speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other . \\nPlato argued that there are some universal forms \\tthat are not a part of particular things . \\nFor example , it is possible that there is no particular good in \\texistence , but `` good '' is still a proper universal form . \\nAristotle disagreed with Plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated at some \\tperiod of time , and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things . \\nIn addition , Aristotle disagreed with \\tPlato about the location of universals . \\nWhere Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them \\t, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated . \\nSo , according to Aristotle , the form of apple exists within \\teach apple , rather than in the world of the forms . \\nPotentiality and \\tactuality . \\nConcerning the nature of change ( `` kinesis '' ) and its causes , as he outlines in his `` Physics '' and `` On Generation and Corruption ( `` 319b–320a ) , he \\tdistinguishes coming-to-be ( `` genesis '' , also translated as 'generation ' ) from : Coming-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed . \\nIn that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( `` dynamis '' ) \\tand actuality ( `` entelecheia '' ) in association with the matter and the form . \\nReferring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing or being \\tacted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else . \\nFor example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( `` dynamei '' ) \\ta plant , and if it is not prevented by something , it will become a plant . \\nPotentially beings can either 'act ' ( `` poiein '' ) or 'be acted upon \\t' ( `` paschein '' ) , which can be either innate or learned . \\nFor example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ) , \\twhile the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting ) . \\nActuality is the fulfilment of \\tthe end of the potentiality . \\nBecause the end ( `` telos '' ) is the principle of every change , and \\tpotentiality exists for the sake of the end , actuality , accordingly , is the end . \\nReferring then to the previous example , it can be said that an \\tactuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do . \\nIn summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity \\tof building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end . \\nThen Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior \\tto potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality . \\nWith this definition of the particular substance ( i.e. , matter and form ) , Aristotle tries to solve the problem \\tof the unity of the beings , for example , `` what is it that makes a man one '' ? \\nSince , according to Plato there are two Ideas : \\tanimal and biped , how then is man a unity ? \\nHowever , according to Aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) \\tand the actual one ( form ) are one and the same . \\nEpistemology \\t. \\nAristotle 's immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of \\tthe universal , whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these . \\nAristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction , whereas Plato \\trelies on deduction from `` a priori '' principles . \\nNatural \\tphilosophy . \\nAristotle 's `` natural philosophy '' spans a wide range of natural phenomena \\tincluding those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences . \\nIn Aristotle 's terminology , `` natural philosophy '' is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the \\tnatural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences . \\nAristotle 's work encompassed virtually \\tall facets of intellectual inquiry . \\nAristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning \\t, which he also would describe as `` science '' . \\nHowever , his use of the term `` science '' carries a \\tdifferent meaning than that covered by the term `` scientific method '' . \\nFor Aristotle , `` all science ( `` dianoia '' ) is either \\tpractical , poetical or theoretical '' ( `` Metaphysics '' 1025b25 ) . \\nHis practical science includes ethics and politics ; his poetical science means the study of \\tfine arts including poetry ; his theoretical science covers physics , mathematics and metaphysics . \\nPhysics \\t. \\nFive \\telements . \\nIn his `` On Generation and Corruption '' , Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles , earth , \\twater , air , and fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry . \\nIn the Empedoclean scheme , all matter was made \\tof the four elements , in differing proportions . \\nAristotle 's scheme added the heavenly aether , the divine \\tsubstance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets . \\nMotion \\t. \\nAristotle describes two kinds of motion : `` violent '' or `` unnatural motion '' , such as that of a thrown stone , in the `` Physics \\t'' ( 254b10 ) , and `` natural motion '' , such as of a falling object , in `` On the Heavens '' ( 300a20 ) . \\nIn violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also : in other \\twords , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , since Aristotle does not address friction . \\nWith this understanding , it can be observed that , as Aristotle stated , heavy objects ( on the ground \\t, say ) require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster . \\nThis would imply the equation \\tincorrect in modern physics . \\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned : the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 Empedoclean \\telements move vertically up ( like fire , as is observed ) or down ( like earth ) towards their natural resting places . \\nIn the `` Physics '' ( 215a25 ) , Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional ( say , with constant c ) to its weight , W , and inversely \\tproportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling : ; Aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible . \\nOpinions have varied on whether Aristotle \\tintended to state quantitative laws . \\nHenri Carteron held the `` extreme view '' that Aristotle 's concept \\tof force was basically qualitative , but other authors reject this . \\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle 's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; \\tfloating depends in Archimedes ' scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not , as Aristotle thought , its elementary composition . \\nAristotle 's writings on motion remained \\tinfluential until the Early Modern period . \\nJohn Philoponus ( in the Middle Ages ) and Galileo are said to have shown by experiment \\tthat Aristotle 's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect . \\nA contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli , who argues that Aristotle 's physics of motion is correct within its \\tdomain of validity , that of objects in the Earth 's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air . \\nIn this system , heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones ( whether friction \\tis ignored , or not ) , and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium . \\nNewton 's `` forced '' motion corresponds to Aristotle 's `` violent '' motion with its external agent , but Aristotle 's assumption that the agent 's effect stops immediately it stops acting ( e.g. , the ball leaves the thrower 's hand \\t) has awkward consequences : he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus . \\nFour \\tcauses . \\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can \\tbe attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors . \\nHis term `` aitia '' is traditionally translated as `` cause '' , but it does not always refer to temporal \\tsequence ; it might be better translated as `` explanation '' , but the traditional rendering will be employed here . \\nOptics \\t. \\nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera \\tobscura in `` Problems '' , book 15 . \\nThe apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with \\ta small aperture that let light in . \\nWith it , he saw that whatever shape he made \\tthe hole , the sun 's image always remained circular . \\nHe also noted that increasing the distance between the \\taperture and the image surface magnified the image . \\nChance and \\tspontaneity . \\nAccording to Aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things \\t, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity . \\nChance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of \\taccidental things , `` from what is spontaneous '' . \\nThere is also more a specific kind of chance , which Aristotle names \\t`` luck '' , that only applies to people 's moral choices . \\nAstronomy \\t. \\nIn astronomy , Aristotle refuted Democritus 's claim that the Milky Way was made up of `` those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun 's rays , '' pointing out correctly that if `` the size of the sun \\tis greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . '' \\nGeology and \\tnatural sciences . \\nAristotle was one of the first \\tpeople to record any geological observations . \\nHe stated that geological change was too slow \\tto be observed in one person 's lifetime . \\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change , including `` lakes that had dried up '' and `` deserts that had become watered by rivers '' , giving as \\texamples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer , and `` the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption . '' ' \\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and \\tmeteorology ( including his major writings `` Meteorologica '' ) . \\nFor example , he made some of the earliest observations about desalination : he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated , freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by \\tthe cycle of rainfall and river runoff ( `` I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again . '' ) \\nBiology \\t. \\nEmpirical \\tresearch . \\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , \\tand biology forms a large part of his writings . \\nHe spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding \\tseas , including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos . \\nHis data in `` History of Animals '' , `` Generation of Animals '' , `` Movement of Animals '' , and `` Parts of Animals '' are \\tassembled from his own observations , statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen , and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas . \\nHis apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident : his works on \\tbotany have been lost , but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived . \\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation \\ton Lesbos and the catches of fishermen . \\nHe describes the catfish , electric ray , and frogfish in detail \\t, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus . \\nHis description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods , used in \\tsexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until the 19th century . \\nHe gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants , \\tand of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark . \\nHe notes that an animal 's structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the heron , which lives in marshes with soft mud and \\tlives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear-like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet . \\nDarwin , too , noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal \\t, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution . \\nAristotle 's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while Aristotle \\twas aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents . \\nFor Aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in \\twinter , must be considered distinct from natural causes . \\nHe was thus critical of Empedocles 's materialist theory of a `` survival of the fittest '' origin \\tof living things and their organs , and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results . \\nTo put his views into modern terms , he nowhere says that different species can have a common \\tancestor , or that one kind can change into another , or that kinds can become extinct . \\nScientific \\tstyle . \\nAristotle did not do experiments \\tin the modern sense . \\nHe used the ancient Greek term `` pepeiramenoi '' to \\tmean observations , or at most investigative procedures like dissection . \\nIn `` Generation of Animals '' , he finds a fertilized hen 's egg of \\ta suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo 's heart beating inside . \\nInstead , he practiced a different style of science : systematically gathering data , discovering \\tpatterns common to whole groups of animals , and inferring possible causal explanations from these . \\n; This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of \\tdata become available in a new field , such as genomics . \\nIt does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it \\tsets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed . \\nIn this sense , Aristotle \\t's biology is scientific . \\nFrom the data he collected and documented , Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating \\tthe life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods ( terrestrial placental mammals ) that he studied . \\nAmong these correct predictions \\tare the following . \\nBrood size decreases with ( adult ) body mass , so that an elephant \\thas fewer young ( usually just one ) per brood than a mouse . \\nLifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants \\tlive longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier . \\nAs a final example , fecundity decreases with lifespan , so long-lived kinds \\tlike elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice . \\nClassification of \\tliving things . \\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the `` History of Animals '' in a graded \\tscale of perfection , a nonreligious version of the `` scala naturae '' , with man at the top . \\nHis system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth \\t: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral-like eggs . \\nAnimals came above plants , and \\tthese in turn were above minerals . \\nHe grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter `` animals with \\tblood '' , and below them the colder invertebrates as `` animals without blood '' . \\nThose with blood were divided into the live-bearing ( mammals ) \\t, and the egg-laying ( birds , reptiles , fish ) . \\nThose without blood were insects , crustacea ( non-shelled – cephalopods , \\tand shelled ) and the hard-shelled molluscs ( bivalves and gastropods ) . \\nHe recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and \\tnoted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods . \\nTo a modern biologist , the explanation , \\tnot available to Aristotle , is convergent evolution . \\nPhilosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in \\ttaxonomy , but zoologists who studied this question recently think otherwise . \\nHe believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes ; this \\tteleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design . \\nPsychology \\t. \\nSoul \\t. \\nAristotle 's psychology , given in his treatise `` On the Soul '' ( `` peri psychēs '' ) , posits three \\tkinds of soul ( `` psyches '' ) : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul . \\nHumans have a \\trational soul . \\nThe human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds : Like the vegetative soul it can \\tgrow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally . \\nThe unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and \\tto compare them using the `` nous '' ( intellect ) and `` logos '' ( reason ) . \\nFor Aristotle , the soul is \\tthe form of a living being . \\nBecause all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings \\tis that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g . \\nthe ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , \\tgrowth and chemical transformations , which Aristotle considers types of movement ) . \\nIn contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the Egyptians , \\the placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain . \\nNotable is Aristotle 's division of sensation and thought , which generally differed \\tfrom the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of Alcmaeon . \\nIn `` On the Soul '' , Aristotle famously criticizes Plato 's theory \\tof the soul and develops his own in response to Plato 's . \\nThe first criticism is against Plato 's view of the soul in the `` Timaeus '' \\tthat the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies . \\n20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle 's interpretation of \\tPlato and maintained that he had misunderstood Plato . \\nToday 's scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle \\t's interpretation and have warmed up to it . \\nAristotle 's other criticism is that Plato 's view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to \\tbe mis-matched ; in principle , Aristotle alleges , any soul can go with any body , according to Plato 's theory . \\nAristotle 's claim that the soul is the form of a living \\tbeing is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation . \\nMemory \\t. \\nAccording to Aristotle in `` On the Soul '' , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience \\tin the mind and to distinguish between the internal `` appearance '' and an occurrence in the past . \\nIn other words , a memory is a mental \\tpicture ( phantasm ) that can be recovered . \\nAristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ \\tthat undergoes several changes in order to make a memory . \\nA memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex \\tthat the nervous system can not receive all the impressions at once . \\nThese changes are the same as those involved in \\tthe operations of sensation , Aristotelian , and thinking . \\nAristotle uses the term 'memory ' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , \\tand for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents . \\nMemory is of the past , prediction is of \\tthe future , and sensation is of the present . \\nRetrieval of impressions can \\tnot be performed suddenly . \\nA transitional channel is needed and located in past \\texperiences , both for previous experience and present experience . \\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them \\tas impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences . \\nTo search for these impressions , \\tpeople search the memory itself . \\nWithin the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , \\tthat person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for . \\nRecollection occurs when one retrieved \\texperience naturally follows another . \\nIf the chain of `` images '' is \\tneeded , one memory will stimulate the next . \\nWhen people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous \\texperiences until they reach the one that is needed . \\nRecollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving \\tthe information stored in a memory impression . \\nOnly humans can remember impressions of intellectual \\tactivity , such as numbers and words . \\nAnimals that have perception of time can \\tretrieve memories of their past observations . \\nRemembering involves only perception of the things \\tremembered and of the time passed . \\nAristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically \\tin relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his laws of association . \\nAristotle believed that past experiences \\tare hidden within the mind . \\nA force operates to awaken the hidden \\tmaterial to bring up the actual experience . \\nAccording to Aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates \\tupon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled . \\nDreams \\t. \\nAristotle describes sleep in `` \\tOn Sleep and Wakefulness '' . \\nSleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses \\tor of digestion , so it is vital to the body . \\nWhile a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , \\tsensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness . \\nSince a person can not sense during sleep they can \\tnot have desire , which is the result of sensation . \\nHowever , the senses are able to work during \\tsleep , albeit differently , unless they are weary . \\nDreams do not involve \\tactually sensing a stimulus . \\nIn dreams , sensation is still involved \\t, but in an altered manner . \\nAristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of \\twater , and then looks away , the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion . \\nWhen a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no \\tlonger the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression . \\nWhen the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly \\tencounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored . \\nHowever , during sleep the impressions made throughout the day \\tare noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences . \\nSo , dreams result \\tfrom these lasting impressions . \\nSince impressions are all that are left and not the exact \\tstimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience . \\nDuring sleep , a person is \\tin an altered state of mind . \\nAristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who \\tis overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus . \\nFor example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to \\tthink they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings . \\nSince a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements , \\tthey become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams , like the infatuated person . \\nThis leads the person to believe the dream is real \\t, even when the dreams are absurd in nature . \\nIn `` De Anima '' iii 3 , Aristotle ascribes the ability to create , to store , \\tand to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination , `` phantasia '' . \\nOne component of Aristotle 's theory of \\tdreams disagrees with previously held beliefs . \\nHe claimed that dreams are not foretelling \\tand not sent by a divine being . \\nAristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams \\tdo resemble future events are simply coincidences . \\nAristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the \\tfact that the person is asleep when they experience it . \\nIf a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see \\tsomething in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred . \\nSecondly , any sensory experience that is perceived while a person \\tis asleep does not qualify as part of a dream . \\nFor example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their \\tdream they hear a door is shut , this sensory experience is not part of the dream . \\nLastly , the images of dreams must be a \\tresult of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences . \\nPractical \\tphilosophy . \\nAristotle 's practical philosophy covers areas such as \\tethics , politics , economics , and rhetoric . \\nEthics \\t. \\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e. , one \\taimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake . \\nHe wrote several treatises on ethics , most \\tnotably including the `` Nicomachean Ethics '' . \\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper \\tfunction ( `` ergon '' ) of a thing . \\nAn eye is only a good eye in so much as it \\tcan see , because the proper function of an eye is sight . \\nAristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity \\tof the `` psuchē '' ( `` soul '' ) in accordance with reason ( `` logos '' ) . \\nAristotle identified such an optimum activity ( the virtuous mean , between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency ) of the soul as \\tthe aim of all human deliberate action , `` eudaimonia '' , generally translated as `` happiness '' or sometimes `` well-being '' . \\nTo have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( \\t`` ēthikē '' `` aretē '' ) , often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence . \\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately \\t, but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things . \\nWhen the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( `` phronesis '' ) and their intellect ( `` nous '' ) can develop \\twith each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nIn addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual \\t, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled `` Politics '' . \\nAristotle considered the city to \\tbe a natural community . \\nMoreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family , which in turn is \\tprior to the individual , `` for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part '' . \\nHe famously stated that `` man is by nature a political animal '' and argued \\tthat humanity 's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality . \\nAristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , \\tand as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others . \\nAristotle 's conception of the city is organic , and he is considered \\tone of the first to conceive of the city in this manner . \\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a \\tmodern state is quite different from Aristotle 's understanding . \\nAlthough he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to Aristotle was the city \\t( `` polis '' ) which functions as a political `` community '' or `` partnership '' ( `` koinōnia '' ) . \\nThe aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and \\tto perform beautiful acts : `` The political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together . '' \\nThis is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave \\tthe state of nature because of `` fear of violent death '' or its `` inconveniences '' . \\nIn `` Protrepticus '' , the character 'Aristotle ' states : As Plato 's disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and , following the outline of certain ideas from Plato 's `` Statesman '' , he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed \\tstate : To illustrate this approach , Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting , albeit textually described , where the democratic principle of `` one voter–one vote '' is combined with the oligarchic `` merit-weighted voting '' ; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see . \\nEconomics \\t. \\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , \\tespecially to thought in the Middle Ages . \\nIn `` Politics '' , Aristotle addresses \\tthe city , property , and trade . \\nHis response to criticisms of private property , in Lionel Robbins 's view , anticipated later proponents of \\tprivate property among philosophers and economists , as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements . \\nAristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private \\tproperty is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature . \\nIn `` Politics '' , Aristotle offers one of \\tthe earliest accounts of the origin of money . \\nMoney came into use because people became dependent on one \\tanother , importing what they needed and exporting the surplus . \\nFor the sake of convenience , people then agreed to deal in something \\tthat is intrinsically useful and easily applicable , such as iron or silver . \\nAristotle 's discussions on retail and interest was a \\tmajor influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages . \\nHe had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure \\tthings one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit . \\nIt thus uses goods as a means to an \\tend , rather than as an end unto itself . \\nHe believed that retail trade \\twas in this way unnatural . \\nSimilarly , Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes \\ta gain out of the money itself , and not from its use . \\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money \\tthat was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time . \\nHe wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the \\tnumber of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement . \\nMoney thus allows for the association of different \\tgoods and makes them `` commensurable '' . \\nHe goes on to state that money is also useful \\tfor future exchange , making it a sort of security . \\nThat is , `` if we do not want a thing now , \\twe shall be able to get it when we do want it '' . \\nRhetoric and \\tpoetics . \\nAristotle 's `` Rhetoric '' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience : `` ethos '' ( an appeal to the \\tspeaker 's character ) , `` pathos '' ( an appeal to the audience 's emotion ) , and `` logos '' ( an appeal to logical reasoning ) . \\nHe also categorizes rhetoric into three genres : epideictic ( ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame ) , forensic ( judicial speeches \\tover guilt or innocence ) , and deliberative ( speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue ) . \\nAristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs : `` enthymeme '' ( \\tproof by syllogism ) and `` paradeigma '' ( proof by example ) . \\nAristotle writes in his `` Poetics '' that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance \\tare all fundamentally acts of `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner . \\nHe applies the term `` mimesis '' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the \\tartist 's intention and contends that the audience 's realisation of the `` mimesis '' is vital to understanding the work itself . \\nAristotle states that `` mimesis '' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans \\tfrom animals and that all human artistry `` follows the pattern of nature '' . \\nBecause of this , Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what \\tStephen Halliwell calls `` highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes . '' \\nFor example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony \\t, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language . \\nThe forms also differ in \\ttheir object of imitation . \\nComedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse \\tthan average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . \\nLastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or \\tcharacter , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . \\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle 's `` Poetics '' originally comprised two books – one \\ton comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived . \\nAristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot-structure , \\tcharacter , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry . \\nThe characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; \\tand the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy . \\nTragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , \\tand is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions . \\nAristotle concludes `` Poetics '' with a discussion on which , \\tif either , is superior : epic or tragic mimesis . \\nHe suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , \\tis more unified , and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic . \\nAristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school \\thad a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop . \\nViews on \\twomen . \\nAristotle 's analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine \\telement bringing life to an inert , passive female element . \\nThe biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction , which changes her \\tbody temperature , which in turn makes her , in Aristotle 's view , incapable of participating in political life . \\nOn this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics \\thave accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism . \\nHowever , Aristotle gave equal weight to women 's happiness as he did to men 's , and commented in \\this `` Rhetoric '' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men . \\nInfluence \\t. \\nMore than 2300 years after his death , Aristotle remains \\tone of the most influential people who ever lived . \\nHe contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in \\texistence , and he was the founder of many new fields . \\nAccording to the philosopher Bryan Magee , `` it is doubtful whether \\tany human being has ever known as much as he did '' . \\nAmong countless other achievements , Aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology \\t, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method . \\nTaneli Kukkonen , writing in `` The Classical Tradition '' , observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched , and his reach \\tin influencing `` every branch of intellectual enterprise '' including Western ethical and political theory , theology , rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long . \\nAs a result , Kukkonen argues , any analysis of reality today `` will \\talmost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind . '' \\nJonathan Barnes wrote that `` an account of Aristotle 's intellectual afterlife \\twould be little less than a history of European thought '' . \\nOn his successor \\t, Theophrastus . \\nAristotle 's pupil and successor , Theophrastus , wrote the `` \\tHistory of Plants '' , a pioneering work in botany . \\nSome of his technical terms remain in use , such as carpel from `` carpos \\t'' , fruit , and pericarp , from `` pericarpion '' , seed chamber . \\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than \\tAristotle was , instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned . \\nOn later \\tGreek philosophers . \\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle 's work was felt \\tas the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school . \\nAristotle 's students included Aristoxenus , Dicaearchus , Demetrius of Phalerum , Eudemos of \\tRhodes , Harpalus , Hephaestion , Mnason of Phocis , Nicomachus , and Theophrastus . \\nAristotle 's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter 's bringing \\twith him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers . \\nHe had also learned a great deal about \\tPersian customs and traditions from his teacher . \\nAlthough his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle 's geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , Alexander complained `` \\tThou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men 's common property ? '' \\nOn Hellenistic \\tscience . \\nAfter Theophrastus , the Lyceum failed \\tto produce any original work . \\nThough interest in Aristotle 's ideas survived \\t, they were generally taken unquestioningly . \\nIt is not until the age of Alexandria under the \\tPtolemies that advances in biology can be again found . \\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria , Herophilus of Chalcedon , corrected Aristotle , placing \\tintelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation . \\nHerophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting \\tthat the latter pulse while the former do not . \\nThough a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life , teleology ( and after \\tthe rise of Christianity , natural theology ) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries . \\nErnst Mayr states that there was `` nothing of any real \\tconsequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance . '' \\nOn Byzantine \\tscholars . \\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle \\tby copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus . \\nThe first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus , Elias , and \\tDavid in the sixth century , and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century . \\nJohn Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle 's views on \\tthe eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of Aristotelian thought . \\nPhiloponus questioned Aristotle 's teaching of physics , noting its flaws \\tand introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations . \\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus \\treappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena . \\nOn the medieval \\tIslamic world . \\nAristotle was one of the most revered \\tWestern thinkers in early Islamic theology . \\nMost of the still extant works of Aristotle , as well as a number of the original \\tGreek commentaries , were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars . \\nAverroes , Avicenna and Alpharabius , who wrote on Aristotle in great \\tdepth , also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers . \\nAlkindus greatly admired Aristotle 's philosophy , and Averroes spoke of \\tAristotle as the `` exemplar '' for all future philosophers . \\nMedieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle \\tas the `` First Teacher '' . \\nThe title was later used by Western philosophers ( as in the famous \\tpoem of Dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy . \\nOn medieval \\tEurope . \\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West , Aristotle was practically unknown there \\tfrom c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the `` Organon '' made by Boethius . \\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made , both from Arabic translations , such \\tas those by Gerard of Cremona , and from the original Greek , such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke . \\nAfter the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his `` Summa Theologica '' , working from Moerbeke 's translations and calling Aristotle `` The Philosopher '' , the demand \\tfor Aristotle 's writings grew , and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West , stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance . \\nThese thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity , bringing \\tthe thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages . \\nScholars such as Boethius , Peter Abelard , \\tand John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic . \\nThe medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having A cautionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander \\tto avoid the king 's seductive mistress , Phyllis , but was himself captivated by her , and allowed her to ride him . \\nPhyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect , and he witnessed Phyllis proving \\tthat a woman 's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher 's male intellect . \\nArtists such as Hans Baldung produced a \\tseries of illustrations of the popular theme . \\nThe Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in `` The Divine Comedy '' : Besides Dante \\t's fellow poets , the classical figure that most influenced the `` Comedy '' is Aristotle . \\nDante built up the philosophy of the `` Comedy '' with the works of Aristotle as \\ta foundation , just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking . \\nDante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works \\tand indirectly through quotations in the works of Albert Magnus . \\nDante even acknowledges Aristotle 's influence explicitly in the poem , specifically when \\tVirgil justifies the Inferno 's structure by citing the `` Nicomachean Ethics '' . \\nOn medieval \\tJudaism . \\nMoses Maimonides ( considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism ) adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars \\tand based his `` Guide for the Perplexed '' on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy . \\nMaimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived \\t, and styled him as the `` chief of the philosophers '' . \\nAlso , in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon , Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers \\twho preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are `` sufficient by themselves and [ superior ] to all that were written before them . \\nHis intellect , Aristotle 's is the extreme limit of human intellect , apart from him upon whom the divine emanation \\thas flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy , there being no level higher '' . \\nOn Early \\tModern scientists . \\nIn the Early Modern period , scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories \\tof Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment . \\nHarvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than \\tbeing the seat of the soul and the controller of the body 's heat , as Aristotle thought . \\nGalileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle 's physics , proposing \\tthat bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight . \\nOn 18th/19th-century \\tthinkers . \\nThe 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to \\thave taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle . \\nAristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ( `` \\tnatural slaves '' ) , and the natural superiority ( virtue , `` arete '' ) of others . \\nIt was Martin Heidegger , not Nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation \\tof Aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition . \\nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle 's logic , but decided `` to go under , over , \\tand beyond '' it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book `` The Laws of Thought '' . \\nThis gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and \\tallows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two . \\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most \\timportant contributor to the subject of biology . \\nIn an 1882 letter he wrote that `` Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods \\t, though in very different ways , but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle '' . \\nAlso , in later editions of the book `` On the Origin of Species ' , Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far \\tback as Aristotle ; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles . \\nJames Joyce 's favoured philosopher was Aristotle , whom he considered \\tto be `` the greatest thinker of all times '' . \\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge said : Everybody is \\tborn either a Platonist or an Aristotelian . \\nAyn Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy \\tshe could only recommend `` three A 's '' —Aristotle , Aquinas , and Ayn Rand . \\nShe also regarded Aristotle as \\tthe greatest of all philosophers . \\nKarl Marx considered Aristotle to be the `` greatest thinker of antiquity '' , and called him \\ta `` giant thinker '' , a `` genius '' , and `` the great scholar '' . \\nModern rejection \\tand rehabilitation . \\nDuring the 20th century , Aristotle \\t's work was widely criticized . \\nThe philosopher Bertrand Russell argued that `` almost every serious intellectual advance \\thas had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine '' . \\nRussell called Aristotle 's ethics `` repulsive '' , and labelled \\this logic `` as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy '' . \\nRussell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle \\t, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors . \\nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by `` proceed \\t[ ing ] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character '' on limited evidence from their senses . \\nIn 1985 , the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in `` pure seventeenth century '' tones that Aristotle had assembled `` a \\tstrange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility '' . \\nBy the start of the 21st century , however , Aristotle was taken more seriously : Kukkonen noted that `` In \\tthe best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition . '' \\nAlasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way \\tthat is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans . \\nKukkonen observed , too , that `` that most enduring of romantic images , Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander '' remained current , as in the 2004 \\tfilm `` Alexander '' , while the `` firm rules '' of Aristotle 's theory of drama have ensured a role for the `` Poetics '' in Hollywood . \\nBiologists continue to be interested \\tin Aristotle 's thinking . \\nArmand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle 's biology , while Niko Tinbergen 's four questions , based on Aristotle 's \\tfour causes , are used to analyse animal behaviour ; they examine function , phylogeny , mechanism , and ontogeny . \\nSurviving \\tworks . \\nCorpus \\tAristotelicum . \\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through \\tmedieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum . \\nThese texts , as opposed to Aristotle 's lost works \\t, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle 's school . \\nReference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker 's Royal Prussian Academy edition ( `` Aristotelis Opera edidit \\tAcademia Regia Borussica '' , Berlin , 1831–1870 ) , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works . \\nLoss and \\tpreservation . \\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls , \\tthe common writing medium of that era . \\nHis writings are divisible into two groups : the `` exoteric '' , intended for \\tthe public , and the `` esoteric '' , for use within the Lyceum school . \\nAristotle 's `` lost '' works stray considerably \\tin characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus . \\nWhereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to \\tsubsequent publication , the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication . \\nCicero 's description of Aristotle 's literary style as `` a river of gold \\t'' must have applied to the published works , not the surviving notes . \\nA major question in the history of Aristotle 's works is how the exoteric writings \\twere all lost , and how the ones now possessed came to be found . \\nThe consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle 's school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them \\tfrom those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today . \\nLegacy \\t. \\nDepictions \\t. \\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder , Justus van Gent , \\tRaphael , Paolo Veronese , Jusepe de Ribera , Rembrandt , and Francesco Hayez over the centuries . \\nAmong the best-known depictions is Raphael 's fresco `` The School of Athens '' , in the Vatican 's Apostolic Palace , \\twhere the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image , at the architectural vanishing point , reflecting their importance . \\nRembrandt 's `` Aristotle with a Bust of Homer '' , too , is a celebrated work , showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age : as the art critic \\tJonathan Jones writes , `` this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world , ensnaring us in its musty , glowing , pitch-black , terrible knowledge of time . '' \\nEponyms \\t. \\nThe Aristotle Mountains in Antarctica \\tare named after Aristotle . \\nHe was the first person known to conjecture , in his book `` Meteorology '' , \\tthe existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and called it `` Antarctica '' . \\nAristoteles is a crater on the Moon bearing \\tthe classical form of Aristotle 's name . \\nFurther \\treading . \\nThe secondary literature on \\tAristotle is vast . \\nThe following is only \\ta small selection . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 309 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=309 '' title= '' An American in Paris '' \\t> An American in Paris An American in Paris is a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer George Gershwin first performed in 1928 . \\nIt was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris and \\tevokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the `` '' . \\nGershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the \\tsymphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns . \\nHe brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition , which took place \\ton December 13 , 1928 , in Carnegie Hall , with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic . \\nIt was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his Concerto in F \\tfollowing the earlier success of `` Rhapsody in Blue '' ( 1924 ) . \\nHe completed the orchestration on November 18 , less \\tthan four weeks before the work 's premiere . \\nHe collaborated on the original program notes \\twith critic and composer Deems Taylor . \\nBackground \\t. \\nAlthough the story is likely apocryphal , Gershwin is said to have been attracted by Maurice Ravel 's unusual \\tchords , and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel . \\nAfter his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , Ravel said he could not \\tteach him , saying , `` Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin ? '' \\nGershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to \\tthe United States for a tour . \\nTo this end , upon his return to New York , Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel 's friend Robert Schmitz , a pianist Ravel had met during the war , to urge Ravel to tour the \\tU.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica , promoting Franco-American musical relations , and was able to offer Ravel a $ 10,000 fee for the tour , an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel . \\nGershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during \\ta party held for Ravel 's birthday by Éva Gauthier . \\nRavel 's tour reignited Gershwin 's desire to return to Paris \\t, which he and his brother Ira did after meeting Ravel . \\nRavel 's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Nadia Boulanger caused \\tGershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris . \\nYet after he played for her , she \\ttold him she could not teach him . \\nBoulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students \\t: `` What could I give you that you have n't already got ? '' \\nThis did not set Gershwin back , as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based \\ton Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his `` Rhapsody in Blue '' . \\nParis at this time hosted many expatriate writers , among them Ezra Pound \\t, W. B. Yeats , Ernest Hemingway , and artist Pablo Picasso . \\nComposition \\t. \\nGershwin based `` An American in Paris '' on a melodic fragment called `` Very Parisienne '' , written \\tin 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts , Robert and Mabel Schirmer . \\nGershwin called it `` a rhapsodic ballet '' ; it is written \\tfreely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works . \\nGershwin explained in `` Musical America '' , `` My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in \\tParis as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the French atmosphere . '' \\nThe piece is structured into five sections , \\twhich culminate in a loose ABA format . \\nGershwin 's first A episode introduces the two main `` walking '' themes in the `` \\tAllegretto grazioso '' and develops a third theme in the `` Subito con brio '' . \\nThe style of this A section is written in the \\ttypical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six . \\nThis A section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies \\twith the sounds of oboe , English horn , and taxi horns . \\nThe B section 's `` Andante ma con ritmo deciso \\t'' introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness . \\nThe `` Allegro '' that follows continues to \\texpress homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues . \\nIn the B section , Gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and \\tbluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum . \\n`` Moderato con grazia '' is the last A \\tsection that returns to the themes set in A . \\nAfter recapitulating the `` walking '' themes , Gershwin overlays the slow \\tblues theme from section B in the final `` Grandioso '' . \\nResponse \\t. \\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch 's interpretation at \\tthe world premiere of `` An American in Paris '' . \\nHe stated that Damrosch 's sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to \\twalk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work . \\nThe audience , according to Edward Cushing , responded with `` a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine \\tin contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses . '' \\nCritics believed that `` An American in Paris '' was better crafted than Gershwin 's Concerto in F. Some did not \\tthink it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck , Richard Wagner , or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere . \\nGershwin responded to the \\tcritics : Instrumentation . \\n`` An American in Paris '' was originally scored for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubling on piccolo ) , 2 oboes , English horn , 2 clarinets in B-flat , bass clarinet in B-flat , 2 bassoons , 4 horns in F , 3 trumpets in B-flat , 3 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass \\tdrum , triangle , wood block , ratchet , cymbals , low and high tom-toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 4 taxi horns labeled as A , B , C , and D with circles around them , alto saxophone , tenor saxophone , baritone saxophone ( all doubling soprano and alto saxophones ) , and strings . \\nAlthough most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A , B , C , and D \\t, it had been Gershwin 's intention to use the notes A4 , B4 , D5 , and A3 . \\nIt is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A , B , C , and D \\twith circles , he was referring to the four horns , and not the notes that they played . \\nA major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only \\tthree instruments : alto , tenor and baritone ; the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments . \\nThis became the standard performing edition until 2000 , when Gershwin specialist Jack Gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of `` An American \\tin Paris '' , working directly from Gershwin 's original manuscript , including the restoration of Gershwin 's soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson 's revision . \\nGibbons ' restored orchestration of `` An American in Paris '' was performed at London 's Queen Elizabeth \\tHall on July 9 , 2000 , by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian . \\nWilliam Daly arranged the score for piano solo ; \\tthis was published by New World Music in 1929 . \\nPreservation \\tstatus . \\nOn September 22 , 2013 , it was announced that a musicological \\tcritical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released . \\nThe Gershwin family , working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan \\t, were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin 's true intent . \\nIt was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the \\tblues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ) , or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin 's composition process . \\nThe score to `` An American in Paris '' was scheduled to \\tbe issued first in a series of scores to be released . \\nThe entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete , but `` \\tAn American in Paris '' was planned to be an early volume in the series . \\nTwo urtext editions of the work were published \\tby the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015 . \\nThe changes made by Campbell-Watson \\twere withdrawn in both editions . \\nIn the extended urtext , 120 \\tbars of music were re-integrated . \\nConductor Walter Damrosch had cut them \\tshortly before the first performance . \\nOn September 9 , 2017 , The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition \\tof the piece prepared by Mark Clague , director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan . \\nThis performance was of \\tthe original 1928 orchestration . \\nRecordings \\t. \\n`` An American in Paris \\t'' has been frequently recorded . \\nThe first recording was made for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929 with Nathaniel \\tShilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra , drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra . \\nGershwin was on hand to `` supervise '' the recording ; however , Shilkret was \\treported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio . \\nThen , a little later , Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so \\the hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo ; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording . \\nThis recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended \\tusing the notes A-flat , B-flat , a higher D , and a lower A . \\nThe radio broadcast of the September 8 , 1937 , Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert , in which `` An American in Paris \\t, '' also conducted by Shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set . \\nArthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA \\tVictor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music . \\nIn 1945 , Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the piece for RCA Victor \\t, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer . \\nThe Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin 's original score , \\tbefore he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today . \\nHarry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album `` One Night Stand , \\t'' recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago ( Columbia GL 522 and CL 522 ) . \\nUse in \\tfilm . \\nIn 1951 , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film , `` An \\tAmerican in Paris '' , featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron . \\nWinning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar , and numerous other awards , the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli , featured many tunes of Gershwin , and concluded with an \\textensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the `` An American in Paris '' symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by Johnny Green ) , costing $ 500,000 . \\nExternal \\tlinks . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 316 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ?

curid=324 '' title= '' Academy Awards '' > Academy Awards \\tThe Academy Awards , better known as the Oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit for the American and international film industry . \\nThe awards are regarded by many as the most \\tprestigious , significant awards in the entertainment industry worldwide . \\nGiven annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , the awards are \\tan international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements , as assessed by the Academy 's voting membership . \\nThe various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy , officially called the `` \\tAcademy Award of Merit '' , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the `` Oscar '' . \\nThe statuette , depicting a knight rendered in the Art Deco style , was originally sculpted \\tby Los Angeles artist George Stanley from a design sketch by art director Cedric Gibbons . \\nThe 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929 at a private \\tdinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel . \\nThe Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in \\t1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . \\nIt is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards \\tceremony and is now televised live worldwide . \\nIt is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards ; its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for \\ttelevision , the Tony Awards for theater , and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards . \\nA total of 3,140 Oscar statuettes have \\tbeen awarded since its inception in 1929 . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16 , 1929 , at a \\tprivate dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people . \\nThe post-awards party was held \\tat the Mayfair Hotel . \\nThe cost of guest tickets for that night 's ceremony \\twas $ 5 ( $ at 2020 prices ) . \\nFifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the \\tfilm-making industry of the time , for their works during the 1927–28 period . \\nThe ceremony ran \\tfor 15 minutes . \\nFor this first ceremony , winners were \\tannounced to the media three months earlier . \\nFor the second ceremony in 1930 , and the rest of the first decade , the \\tresults were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards . \\nIn 1940 , the `` Los Angeles Times '' announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a \\tresult , the following year the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners . \\nThe term `` Oscar '' is a registered trademark of the AMPAS ; however , in the Italian language \\t, it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony , regardless of which field . \\nMilestones \\t. \\nThe first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings , for his performances in \\t`` The Last Command '' and `` The Way of All Flesh '' . \\nHe had to return to Europe before the ceremony , so the Academy agreed to give \\thim the prize earlier ; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history . \\nAt that time , winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , Jannings \\treceived the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films . \\nWith the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and \\tprofessionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . \\nFor the first six ceremonies , the \\teligibility period spanned two calendar years . \\nAt the 29th ceremony , held in 1957 , the Best Foreign Language \\tFilm category , now known as Best International Feature Film , was introduced . \\nUntil then , foreign-language films had been \\thonored with the Special Achievement Award . \\nPerhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel , who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy \\tChandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974 . \\nBemused host David Niven quipped , `` Is n't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh \\tthat man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings ? '' \\nLater , evidence arose suggesting that Opel 's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show 's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler , the show 's business manager , believed that the incident had been \\tplanned in some way ; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler 's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line , which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be . \\nThe 74th Academy Awards , held in 2002 , \\tpresented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature . \\nFrom 1973 to 2020 , all Academy Awards ceremonies \\thave ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture . \\nFor 2021 , this tradition was broken as the \\tceremony ended with the Academy Award for Best Actor . \\nTraditionally , the previous year 's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress \\t, while the previous year 's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor . \\nOn February 9 , 2020 , `` Parasite '' became the first foreign-language \\tfilm to win Best Picture at the award ceremony of 92nd Academy Awards . \\nTom Hanks announced at the 2020 Oscar Ceremony , the opening of \\tthe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on December 14 , 2020 . \\nThe museum development started in 2017 under Kerry Brougher \\t, but is now led by Bill Kramer . \\nThe industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture , the art & amp ; science of film making , exhibiting trailblazing \\tdirectors , actors , film-makers , sound editors and more , and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like Dorothy 's Ruby Red Slippers . \\nThe 93rd Academy Awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021 , was held on April 25 , 2021 , \\tafter it was postponed from its original February 28 , 2021 , schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema . \\nAs with two previous ceremonies \\t, there was no host . \\nThe ceremony was \\tbroadcast on ABC . \\nIt took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles , California for the 19th consecutive \\tyear , along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles . \\nBecause of the virus impact on films and TV industries , Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony \\t, streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible , though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return . \\nOscar \\tstatuette . \\nAcademy Award \\tof Merit . \\nThe best known award is the Academy Award of \\tMerit , more popularly known as the Oscar statuette . \\nMade of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base , it is 13.5 in ( 34.3 cm ) tall , weighs 8.5 lb ( 3.856 \\tkg ) , and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes . \\nThe five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy : \\tActors , Writers , Directors , Producers , and Technicians . \\nSculptor George Stanley ( who also did the Muse Fountain \\tat the Hollywood Bowl ) sculpted Cedric Gibbons ' design . \\nThe statuettes presented at the initial \\tceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze . \\nWithin a few years , the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal , a pewter-like \\talloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 24-karat gold . \\nDue to a metal shortage during World War II , \\tOscars were made of painted plaster for three years . \\nFollowing the war , the Academy invited recipients to \\tredeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones . \\nThe only addition to the Oscar since it was \\tcreated is a minor streamlining of the base . \\nThe original Oscar mold was cast \\tin 1928 at the C.W . \\nShumway & amp ; Sons Foundry in Batavia , Illinois , which also contributed \\tto casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award 's statuettes . \\nFrom 1983 to 2015 , approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with \\tgold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S . \\nOwens & amp \\t; Company . \\nIt would take between three and \\tfour weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes . \\nIn 2016 , the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes \\t, handing manufacturing duties to Walden , New York-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry . \\nWhile based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar \\t, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal . \\nCast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished , they are \\tthen electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn , New York–based Epner Technology . \\nThe time required to produce 50 \\tsuch statuettes is roughly three months . \\nR.S \\t. \\nOwens is expected to continue producing other awards for \\tthe Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating . \\nNaming \\t. \\nThe Academy officially adopted the name `` \\tOscar '' for the trophies in 1939 . \\nHowever , the origin of \\tthe nickname is disputed . \\nOne biography of Bette Davis , who was a president of the Academy in 1941 , \\tclaims she named the award after her first husband , band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson . \\nA frequently mentioned originator is Margaret Herrick , the Academy executive director , who , when she first saw the award \\tin 1931 , said the statuette reminded her of `` Uncle Oscar '' , a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce . \\nColumnist Sidney Skolsky , who was present during Herrick 's naming in 1931 , \\twrote that `` Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar ' . '' \\nThe Academy credits Skolsky with `` the first confirmed newspaper reference '' to `` Oscar '' in his \\tcolumn on March 16 , 1934 , which was written about that year 's 6th Academy Awards . \\nThe 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of \\t`` Oscar '' : a `` Time '' magazine story . \\nIn the ceremonies that year , Walt Disney was the first to \\tthank the Academy for his `` Oscar '' during his acceptance speech . \\nBruce Davis , in preparing a history of the awards for his book `` The Academy and the Award '' , found that the term `` Oscar '' had \\tcome from Eleanore Lilleberg , a secretary within the Academy when the award was first introduced , as she had been in charge of pre-ceremony handling of the awards . \\nDavis found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg , Eleanore 's brother , that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army \\tveteran named Oscar the two knew in Chicago , who Einar described as `` stood straight and tall '' . \\nIn 2021 , Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the likely first public mention of the name `` Oscar '' , \\tin journalist Relman Morin 's column `` Cinematters '' in the `` Los Angeles Evening Post-Record '' on December 5 , 1933 . \\nAs the award did not take place that year , Relman Morin \\twrote : `` What 's happened to the annual Academy banquet ? \\nAs a rule , the banquet and the awarding of `` Oscar '' the \\tbronze statuette given for best performances , is all over long before this . '' \\nThis information changes the question of Sidney Skolsky \\tas the first to publicly name the name . \\nEngraving \\t. \\nTo prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the \\tceremony , Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates . \\nUntil 2010 , winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to \\twait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars . \\nSince 2010 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at \\tan inscription-processing station at the Governor 's Ball , a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony . \\nThe \\tR.S . \\nOwens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony \\t, bearing the name of every potential winner . \\nThe nameplates for the non-winning \\tnominees are later recycled . \\nOwnership of \\tOscar statuettes . \\nPrior to 1950 , Oscar statuettes were ( \\tand remain ) the property of the recipient . \\nSince then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette \\tbe first offered for sale back to the Academy for US $ 1 . \\nIf a winner refuses to agree to this \\tstipulation , then the Academy keeps the statuette . \\nAcademy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in \\tpublic auctions and private deals for six-figure sums . \\nIn 1989 , Michael Todd 's grandson tried to sell Todd 's Best Picture Oscar for his \\t1956 production of `` Around the World in 80 Days '' to a movie prop collector . \\nThe Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract \\tby gaining a permanent injunction against the sale . \\nIn 1992 , Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `` The Best \\tYears of Our Lives '' to auction to raise money for his wife 's medical expenses . \\nThough his decision caused controversy , the first-ever Oscar to be sold passed to a \\tprivate collector on August 6 , 1992 for $ 60,500 ( $ today ) . \\nRussell defended his action , saying , `` I \\tdo n't know why anybody would be critical . \\nMy wife 's health is much \\tmore important than sentimental reasons . \\nThe movie will be here , \\teven if Oscar is n't . '' \\nIn December 2011 , Orson Welles ' 1941 Oscar for `` Citizen Kane '' ( Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ) was put up for \\tauction , after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy . \\nOn December 20 , 2011 , it sold in an \\tonline auction for US $ 861,542 ( $ today ) . \\nSome buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the \\tAcademy , which keeps them in its treasury . \\nOther awards presented \\tby the Academy . \\nIn addition to the Academy Award of Merit ( Oscar award ) , there are nine honorary ( non-competitive ) awards presented by the Academy from time to time ( except \\tfor the Academy Honorary Award , the Technical Achievement Award , and the Student Academy Awards , which are presented annually ) : The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting . \\nNomination \\t. \\nFrom 2004 to 2020 , the Academy Award nomination \\tresults were announced to the public in mid-January . \\nPrior to that , the results \\twere announced in early February . \\nIn 2021 , the nominees \\twere announced in March . \\nIn 2022 , the nominees were announced in \\tearly February for the first time since 2003 . \\nVoters \\t. \\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , \\ta professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 . \\nAcademy membership is divided into different branches , with \\teach representing a different discipline in film production . \\nActors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 1,311 members \\t( 22 percent ) of the Academy 's composition . \\nVotes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers ( and its \\tpredecessor Price Waterhouse ) since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935 . \\nThe firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a \\tdue date sometime in January of the next year , then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours . \\nAll AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board \\tof Governors , on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees . \\nMembership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit \\ta name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures . \\nNew membership proposals \\tare considered annually . \\nThe Academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 2007 \\tpress releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join . \\nThe 2007 release also stated that it \\thas just under 6,000 voting members . \\nWhile the membership had been growing , stricter \\tpolicies have kept its size steady since then . \\nIn 2012 , the results of a study conducted by the `` Los Angeles Times '' \\twere published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 % of AMPAS ' voting membership . \\nOf the 5,100+ active voters confirmed , 94 % were Caucasian , 77 % were \\tmale , and 54 % were found to be over the age of 60 . \\n33 % of voting members are former nominees ( \\t14 % ) and winners ( 19 % ) . \\nIn May 2011 , the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so \\tvoting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013 . \\nRules \\t. \\nAccording to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December \\t31 , in Los Angeles County , California , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the Best International Feature Film , Best Documentary Feature , and awards in short film categories ) . \\nAdditionally , the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run \\t, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6 pm and 10 pm local time . \\nFor example , the 2009 Best Picture winner , `` The Hurt Locker '' , was originally first released in 2008 , but did not qualify \\tfor the 2008 awards , as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009 , thus qualifying for the 2009 awards . \\nForeign films must include English subtitles , and each country can submit only \\tone film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year . \\nRule 2 states that a film must be feature-length , defined as a minimum of 40 minutes , except for short-subject awards , and it must exist either on a \\t35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels . \\nSince the 90th Academy Awards , presented in 2018 , multi-part and \\tlimited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award . \\nThis followed the win of `` '' , an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited \\trelease before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN , in that category in 2017 . \\nThe Academy 's announcement of the new rule \\tmade no direct mention of that film . \\nThe Best International Feature Film award \\tdoes not require a U.S. release . \\nIt requires the film to be submitted \\tas its country 's official selection . \\nThe Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and New York City during the previous calendar year , or a qualifying award at a competitive film \\tfestival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list ( regardless of any public exhibition or distribution ) , or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country 's official selection . \\nThe qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as \\tthose for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings . \\nAdditionally , a film must have been reviewed by a critic from `` The New York Times '' , \\t`` Time Out New York '' , the `` Los Angeles Times '' , or `` LA Weekly '' . \\nProducers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not \\tsubmitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year . \\nThe form includes the production \\tcredits for all related categories . \\nThen , each form is checked and put \\tin a Reminder List of Eligible Releases . \\nAwards in short film categories ( Best Documentary Short Subject , Best Animated Short Film , and \\tBest Live Action Short Film ) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards . \\nFirst , the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year , instead of covering \\tone year starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony . \\nSecond , there are \\tmultiple methods of qualification . \\nThe main method is a week-long theatrical release in `` either '' Los \\tAngeles County `` or '' New York City during the eligibility period . \\nFilms also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film \\tfestivals designated by the Academy , also without regard to prior public distribution . \\nFinally , a film that is selected as a gold , silver , or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student \\tAcademy Awards is also eligible ( Documentary category for that award , and Animation , Narrative , Alternative , or International for the other awards ) . \\nThe requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are \\talso different from those for other awards . \\nOnly one screening per \\tday is required . \\nFor the Documentary award , the screening must start between noon and 10 pm local time ; for other awards , \\tno specific start time is required , but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times . \\nIn late December , ballots , and copies of the Reminder \\tList of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members . \\nFor most categories , members from each of the branches vote \\tto determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( i.e . \\nonly directors vote for directors , writers for writers \\t, actors for actors , etc . ) . \\nIn the special case of Best Picture , all \\tvoting members are eligible to select the nominees . \\nIn all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each \\tmember casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for Best Picture ) ranked preferentially . \\nIn certain categories , including International Feature Film , Documentary and Animated Feature , \\tnominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches . \\nIn most categories , the winner is selected from \\tamong the nominees by plurality voting of all members . \\nSince 2009 , the Best Picture winner \\thas been chosen by instant runoff voting . \\nSince 2013 , re-weighted range voting has been used \\tto select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects . \\nFilm companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running \\tfor Best Picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season . \\nThe Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to \\ttry to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . \\nIt has an awards czar on staff who advises \\tmembers on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . \\nFor example , a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee `` The Hurt Locker '' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted \\tassociates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner ( `` The Hurt Locker '' eventually won ) . \\nAcademy Screening \\tRoom . \\nThe Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the \\tAcademy to view all eligible films ( except , initially , those in the International category ) in one place . \\nIt was introduced in 2019 , for the 2020 Oscars , \\tthough DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided . \\nFor films to be included on the platform , the North American distributor must pay $ 12,500 , including \\ta watermarking fee , and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy . \\nThe platform can be accessed via \\tApple TV and Roku players . \\nThe watermarking process involved several video security firms , creating a forensic \\twatermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings . \\nIn 2021 , for the 2022 Oscars , the Academy banned all physical screeners \\tand in-person screenings , restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room . \\nFilms eligible in the Documentary and International categories were \\tmade available in different sections of the platform . \\nDistributors can also pay an extra fee to add \\tvideo featurettes to promote their films on the platform . \\nThe in-person screenings were said to be \\tcancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic . \\nEligible films do not have to be added to the platform , \\tbut the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are . \\nAwards \\tceremonies . \\nTelecast \\t. \\nThe major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , commonly in late February or early \\tMarch following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees . \\nIt is the culmination of the film awards season , which \\tusually begins during November or December of the previous year . \\nThis is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red \\tcarpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day . \\nBlack tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate \\tnot wearing a bow-tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this . \\n( The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the \\tawards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast . ) \\nThe Academy Awards is the world 's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all-time \\tzones in North America and worldwide , and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world . \\nThe Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC , which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 , when ABC \\ttook over , televising the festivities ( including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 ) through 1970 . \\nNBC regained the rights for five years then ABC resumed broadcast duties \\tin 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028 . \\nThe Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international \\tmarkets ( especially those outside of the Americas ) in more desirable local timeslots . \\nThe ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 , but only \\ttwo South American countries , Chile and Brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast . \\nBy that time , the television rights to the \\tAcademy Awards had been sold in 50 countries . \\nA decade later , the rights were already being sold to 60 countries , and \\tby 1984 , the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries . \\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February , since 2004 , to help \\tdisrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry . \\nAnother reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the \\tNCAA basketball tournament , which would cut into the Academy Awards audience . \\n( In 1976 and 1977 , ABC 's regained Oscars were moved from \\tTuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC 's NCAA title game . ) \\nThe earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC , as it \\tnow usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period . \\nSome years , the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday \\tof March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games . \\nAnother reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to \\tthe religious holidays of Passover and Easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public . \\nAdvertising is somewhat restricted , however , as traditionally no movie studios \\tor competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast . \\nThe production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most Emmys in \\thistory , with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award 's own launch in 1949 . \\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific , since \\tthe 1999 ceremonies , it was moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm ET/5:30 pm PT . \\nThe reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays , that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams \\tcould be avoided , and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier . \\nFor many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast \\tbecause it would cut into the weekend box office . \\nIn 2010 , the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January \\t, citing TV viewers ' fatigue with the film industry 's long awards season . \\nHowever , such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members , to the point where some voters would only have \\ttime to view the contending films streamed on their computers ( as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail ) . \\nFurthermore , a January ceremony on Sunday would \\tclash with National Football League playoff games . \\nIn 2018 , the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from \\tlate February to mid February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 . \\nOriginally scheduled for April 8 , 1968 , the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. \\tOn March 30 , 1981 , the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington , D.C . \\nIn 1993 , an `` In Memoriam '' segment was introduced , honoring those who had made a significant contribution to \\tcinema who had died in the preceding 12 months , a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members . \\nThis segment has drawn criticism over the \\tyears for the omission of some names . \\nCriticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a `` popularity contest '' feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died \\tby the subject 's cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead . \\nThis segment was later followed \\tby a commercial break . \\nIn terms of broadcast length , the ceremony \\tgenerally averages three and a half hours . \\nThe first Oscars , in \\t1929 , lasted 15 minutes . \\nAt the other end of the spectrum , the \\t2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes . \\nIn 2010 , the organizers of the Academy Awards announced \\twinners ' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds . \\nThis , according to organizer Bill Mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what he termed `` \\tthe single most hated thing on the show '' – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion . \\nIn 2016 , in a further effort to streamline speeches \\t, winners ' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker . \\nDuring the 2018 ceremony , host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become , by announcing that he would give a brand-new jet ski to whoever \\tgave the shortest speech of the night ( a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for `` Phantom Thread '' ) . \\n`` The Wall Street Journal '' analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows : 14 on song performances ; 25 on the hosts ' speeches ; 38 on prerecorded \\tclips ; and 78 on the awards themselves , broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement , 24 on winners walking to the stage , and 30 on their acceptance speeches . \\nAlthough still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped ; the 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in \\tthe past eight years ( although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership ) , while the show itself also faced mixed reception . \\nFollowing the show , `` Variety '' reported that ABC was , in negotiating an extension to \\tits contract to broadcast the Oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself . \\nCurrently and nominally , AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice \\tof production staff and hosting , although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions . \\nIn August 2016 , AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028 : the contract \\tneither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast . \\nTV \\tratings . \\nHistorically , the telecast 's viewership is higher when box-office \\thits are favored to win the Best Picture award . \\nMore than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998 , the year of `` Titanic '' , which generated a \\tbox office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US $ 600.8 million in the US , a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years . \\nThe 76th Academy Awards ceremony , in which `` '' ( pre-telecast box office earnings of \\tUS $ 368 million ) received 11 Awards including Best Picture , drew 43.56 million viewers . \\nThe most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 42nd Academy Awards ( \\tBest Picture `` Midnight Cowboy '' ) which drew a 43.4 % household rating on April 7 , 1970 . \\nBy contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office \\ttend to show weaker ratings , despite how much critical acclaim those films have received . \\nThe 78th Academy Awards which awarded low-budget independent film `` Crash '' ( with a pre-Oscar gross of \\tUS $ 53.4 million ) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91 % . \\nIn 2008 , the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66 % household \\trating , the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time , in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards . \\nThe Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent \\tfilm ( `` No Country for Old Men '' ) . \\nWhereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6 million viewers , \\tthe 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4 million . \\nThat is the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen \\tsince it started recording audience totals in 1974 . \\nArchive \\t. \\nThe

\\nCopies are held in a variety of \\tfilm , video , and digital formats . \\nVenues \\t. \\nIn 1929 , the first Academy Awards were presented \\tat a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel . \\nFrom 1930 to 1943 , the ceremony alternated between two venues : the \\tAmbassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles . \\nGrauman 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 \\t, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948 . \\nThe 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre \\tat what had been the Academy 's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood . \\nFrom 1950 to 1960 , the awards \\twere presented at Hollywood 's Pantages Theatre . \\nWith the advent of television , the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York , first at the \\tNBC International Theatre ( 1953 ) and then at the NBC Century Theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles . \\nThe Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium \\tin Santa Monica , California , in 1961 . \\nBy 1969 , the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles \\t, this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center . \\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s \\t, the ceremony returned to the Shrine . \\nIn 2002 , Hollywood 's Dolby Theatre ( previously known as \\tthe Kodak Theatre ) became the presentation 's current venue . \\nAwards of \\tMerit categories . \\nCurrent \\tcategories . \\nIn the first year of the awards , the Best Directing \\taward was split into two categories ( Drama and Comedy ) . \\nAt times , the Best Original Score award has also \\tbeen split into separate categories ( Drama and Comedy/Musical ) . \\nFrom the 1930s through the 1960s , the Art Direction ( now Production Design ) , Cinematography , \\tand Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black-and-white films and color films ) . \\nPrior to 2012 , the Production Design award was called Art \\tDirection , while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup . \\nIn August 2018 , the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live \\t, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony . \\nFollowing dissent from Academy members , they announced that \\tthey would indeed air all 24 categories live . \\nThis followed several proposals ( among them , the introduction of a Popular \\tFilm category ) that the Academy had announced but did not implement . \\nProposed \\tcategories . \\nThe Board of Governors meets each \\tyear and considers new award categories . \\nTo date , the following categories \\thave been proposed : Special categories . \\nThe Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees \\t, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole . \\nThey are not always presented \\ton an annual basis . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nAccusations of \\tcommercialism . \\nDue to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards , many studios spend millions of dollars \\tand hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the `` Oscar season '' . \\nThis has generated accusations of the Academy Awards \\tbeing influenced more by marketing than by quality . \\nWilliam Friedkin , an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in \\tNew York in 2009 , describing it as `` the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself '' . \\nTim Dirks , editor of AMC 's filmsite.org , has written of the Academy Awards : A \\trecent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign . \\nThese campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are \\tbelieved to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie . \\nExamples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against `` Zero Dark Thirty '' suggesting \\tthat it justifies torture and the claim that `` Lincoln '' distorts history . \\nAccusations of \\tbias . \\nTypical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics , biographical \\tdramas , romantic dramedies and family melodramas , most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year . \\nThe Oscars have been infamously known for selecting \\tspecific genres of movies to be awarded . \\nThe term `` Oscar bait '' \\twas coined to describe such movies . \\nThis has led , at times , to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience , e.g. , \\tby favoring `` Oscar bait '' over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues . \\nAllegations of a \\tlack of diversity . \\nThe Academy Awards have long received criticism over \\tits lack of diversity among the nominees . \\nThis criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929 , which shows us that only 6.4 % of academy award nominees \\thave been non-white and since 1991 , 11.2 % of nominees have been non-white , with the rate of winners being even more polarizing . \\nDue to a variety of reasons , including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples , a number of high-profile \\tOscars have been given to yellowface portrayals , as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters . \\nThe 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , popularized on social media with the \\thashtag # OscarsSoWhite , based on activists ' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias . \\nIn response , the Academy initiated `` \\thistoric '' changes in membership by 2020 . \\nMedia critics find the Academy 's efforts to address its \\tracial , gender , and national biases are merely distractions . \\nSome question whether the Academy 's definition of `` merit \\t'' is unjust and disempowering for BIPOC and non-Americans . \\nSymbolism or \\tsentimentalization . \\nActing prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity , to make up for a `` snub '' for a work \\tthat proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded , or presented as a `` career honor '' to recognize a distinguished nominee 's entire body of work . \\nRecognition of streaming \\tmedia film . \\nFollowing the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film `` Roma '' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category , Steven \\tSpielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services . \\nSpielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider \\tand earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films , while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar . \\nThe United States Department of Justice , having heard of this potential rule change , wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019 , \\tcautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy . \\nFollowing its April 2019 board meeting , the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that \\tallow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs . \\n2022 Will Smith and \\tChris Rock slapping incident . \\nDuring the 94th Academy Awards on March 27 , 2022 , Chris Rock \\tjoked about Jada Pinkett Smith 's shaved head , with a `` G.I . \\nJane '' \\treference . \\nWill Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face , then returned to his seat and told Rock \\t, twice , to `` Keep my wife 's name out [ of ] your fucking mouth ! '' \\nWhile later accepting the Best Actor award for `` King Richard '' , Smith \\tapologized to the Academy and the other nominees , but not to Rock . \\nRock decided not to \\tpress charges against Smith . \\nOn April 8 , 2022 , the Academy made an announcement on a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO \\tDawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith is banned from the Oscars for 10 years in result from the slap . \\nRefusals of \\tthe award . \\nSome winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted \\tthe ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars . \\nThe first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols ( \\tBest Writing in 1935 for `` The Informer '' ) . \\nNichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of \\tconflicts between the Academy and the Writers ' Guild . \\nNichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three \\tyears later , at the 1938 ceremony . \\nNichols was nominated for three further \\tAcademy Awards during his career . \\nGeorge C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award ( Best Actor \\tin 1970 for `` Patton '' ) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony . \\nScott described it as a `` meat parade '' , saying \\t, `` I do n't want any part of it . '' \\nThe third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando , who refused his award ( Best Actor for \\t1972 's `` The Godfather '' ) , citing the film industry 's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans . \\nAt the 45th Academy Awards ceremony , Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page \\tspeech in his place , detailing his criticisms , for which there was booing and cheering by the audience . \\nDisqualifications \\t. \\nSix films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony : One film was disqualified after winning the award , and had the winner \\treturn the Oscar : One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar : Gender segregation . \\nSome advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male \\tand female acting categories in the Academy Awards , Emmy Awards and Tony Awards . \\nThough some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men \\tto dominate unsegregated categories , other categories are unsegregated . \\nAssociated \\tevents . \\nThe following events are closely associated with the \\tannual Academy Awards : Presenter and performer gifts . \\nIt has become a tradition to give out gift \\tbags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars . \\nIn recent years , these gifts have also \\tbeen extended to award nominees and winners . \\nThe value of each of these gift bags can \\treach into the tens of thousands of dollars . \\nIn 2014 , the value was reported to \\tbe as high as US $ 80,000 . \\nThe value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue \\tService issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status . \\nOscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four-night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , spa \\ttreatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , weight-loss gummie candy and up to $ 25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich . \\nSome of the gifts have even had a `` risque '' element to them ; in 2014 , \\tthe adult products retailer Adam & amp ; Eve had a `` Secret Room Gifting Suite '' . \\nCelebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag , Carolyn Hennesy , \\tKate Linder , Chris Mulkey , Jim O'Heir , and John Salley . \\nTelevision ratings and \\tadvertisement prices . \\nFrom 2006 onwards , results are Live+SD \\t; all previous years are live viewing . \\nNotable highest wins \\tand nominees . \\nBy \\tfranchises . \\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations ( 5 or more ) : The \\tfollowing winners received multiple awards ( 2 or more ) : By people . \\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations ( 5 or more ) : The following winners received multiple awards including honorary or non-competitive ( 3 or more ) : < /doc > < doc id= '' 325 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=325 '' title= '' Action Film '' > Action Film \\t< /doc > < doc id= '' 330 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=330 '' title= '' Actrius '' > Actrius Actresses ( Catalan : Actrius ) is a 1997 Catalan language Spanish drama film produced and directed by Ventura Pons and based on the award-winning stage play `` E.R .

Aside from this , once published in Circular T , the TAI scale is not revised . \\nIn hindsight , it is possible to discover errors in TAI \\tand to make better estimates of the true proper time scale . \\nSince the published circulars are definitive , better estimates do not create another version of TAI ; \\tit is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time ( TT ) . \\nHistory \\t. \\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by \\ta single atomic clock ; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously . \\nAtomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 , using the first caesium \\tatomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory , UK ( NPL ) . \\nIt was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the Royal Greenwich \\tObservatory and to establish a time scale , called Greenwich Atomic ( GA ) . \\nThe United States Naval Observatory began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956 , using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock \\t, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards , Boulder , Colorado on 9 October 1957 . \\nThe International Time Bureau ( BIH ) began a time scale , Tm or AM , in July 1955 \\t, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals . \\nThe BIH scale , A.1 , and NBS-A were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 The procedures used by the BIH evolved \\t, and the name for the time scale changed : `` A3 '' in 1964 and `` TA ( BIH ) '' in 1969 . \\nThe SI second was defined in terms \\tof the caesium atom in 1967 . \\nFrom 1971 to 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures and the International Committee for Weights and \\tMeasures made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time ( TAI ) . \\nIn the 1970s , it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time \\tdilation , and the combined TAI scale , therefore , corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks . \\nStarting from the Julian Date 2443144.5 ( 1 January 1977 00:00:00 ) , corrections were applied to the output of \\tall participating clocks , so that TAI would correspond to proper time at the geoid ( mean sea level ) . \\nBecause the clocks were , on average , well above sea level , \\tthis meant that TAI slowed by about one part in a trillion . \\nThe former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name `` EAL '' \\t( `` Échelle Atomique Libre '' , meaning `` Free Atomic Scale '' ) . \\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time ( TCB ) , Geocentric \\tCoordinate Time ( TCG ) , and Terrestrial Time ( TT ) , which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system . \\nAll three of these time scales were defined to read JD \\t2443144.5003725 ( 1 January 1977 00:00:32.184 ) exactly at that instant . \\nTAI was henceforth a realisation of TT , with the equation TT ( TAI ) = TAI + 32.184 s. The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R \\twhich stated , `` In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds , the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI , as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC . '' \\nRelation to \\tUTC . \\nContrary to TAI , UTC \\tis a discontinuous time scale . \\nIt is occasionally adjusted \\tby leap seconds . \\nBetween these adjustments , it is composed of segments that \\tare mapped to atomic time by a constant offset . \\nFrom its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 , the adjustments were \\tmade regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated UT2 . \\nAfterward , these adjustments were made only \\tin whole seconds to approximate UT1 . \\nThis was a compromise arrangement in order \\tto enable a publicly broadcast time scale . \\nThe less frequent whole-second adjustments meant that the time scale \\twould be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally . \\nThe fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require \\ta source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 336 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=336 '' title= '' Altruism '' > Altruism Altruism is the principle \\tand moral practice of concern for the welfare and/or happiness of other human beings or animals , resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual . \\nIt is a traditional virtue in many cultures and \\ta core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews . \\nHowever , the object ( s ) \\tof concern vary among cultures and religions . \\nIn an extreme case , altruism may become a synonym \\tof selflessness , which is the opposite of selfishness . \\nThe word `` altruism '' was popularized ( and possibly coined ) by the French philosopher \\tAuguste Comte in French , as `` altruisme '' , for an antonym of egoism . \\nHe derived it from the Italian `` altrui '' , which in turn was derived from \\tLatin `` alteri '' , meaning `` other people '' or `` somebody else '' . \\nAltruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( e.g. , pleasure and quality of life \\t, time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action . \\nSteinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is `` intentional and voluntary actions that \\taim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards '' . \\nIn one sense , the opposite of altruism is spite \\t; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit . \\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of \\tloyalty or concern for the common good . \\nThe latter are predicated upon social relationships \\t, whilst altruism does not consider relationships . \\nMuch debate exists as to whether `` true \\t'' altruism is possible in human psychology . \\nThe theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described \\tas truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification . \\nThe validity of this argument depends on \\twhether qualify as `` benefits '' . \\nThe term `` altruism '' may also refer to an ethical \\tdoctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others . \\nUsed in this sense , it is usually contrasted with egoism \\t, which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first . \\nEffective altruism is the use of evidence and reason \\tto determine the most effective ways to benefit others . \\nThe notion \\tof altruism . \\nThe concept has a long history \\tin philosophical and ethical thought . \\nThe term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , Auguste Comte , \\tand has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists . \\nWhilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields , the \\tdifferent methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism . \\nIn simple terms , altruism is caring about the \\twelfare of other people and acting to help them . \\nScientific \\tviewpoints . \\nAnthropology \\t. \\nMarcel Mauss 's essay `` The Gift '' contains \\ta passage called `` Note on alms '' . \\nThis note describes the evolution of the notion of alms ( \\tand by extension of altruism ) from the notion of sacrifice . \\nIn it , he \\twrites : Evolutionary explanations . \\nIn the science of ethology ( the study of animal behaviour ) , and more generally in the study of social evolution \\t, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor . \\nIn evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity , emergency \\taid , help to coalition partners , tipping , courtship gifts , production of public goods , and environmentalism . \\nTheories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the \\tneed to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins . \\nTwo related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses \\tand from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies . \\nSome of the proposed mechanisms are : Such explanations do not imply that humans are \\talways consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts . \\nInstead , evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms , \\tsuch as emotions , that promote altruistic behaviors . \\nNot every single instance of altruistic behavior necessarily leads to an increase of inclusive fitness since , \\tif that was the case in the ancestral environment , then altruistic behaviors would have been selected . \\nThis also does not imply that on average 50 % or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment -- if the benefits from helping the \\tright person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic , even if in most cases there were no benefits . \\nThe benefits for the altruist may be increased and the \\tcosts reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups . \\nResearch has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin , to friends than to strangers , to those \\tattractive than to those unattractive , to non-competitors than to competitors , and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup . \\nThe study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R. Price 's development of \\tthe Price equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution . \\nAn interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular \\tslime moulds , such as `` Dictyostelium mucoroides '' . \\nThese protists live as individual amoebae until starved , at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting \\tbody in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body . \\nSelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds , and associated emotional , cognitive , and neurohormonal mechanisms , evolved \\tin order to facilitate long-term , high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success . \\nSuch cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter \\tKropotkin in his 1902 book `` '' and Moral Philosopher Peter Singer in his book `` A Darwinian Left '' . \\nNeurobiology \\t. \\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman , neuroscientists at the National \\tInstitutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network ( J.M . ) \\nprovided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving \\tin normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging . \\nIn their research , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006 , they showed that both pure \\tmonetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex . \\nHowever , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making \\tcharitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated : the subgenual cortex/septal region . \\nThese structures are intimately related to social \\tattachment and bonding in other species . \\nAltruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses \\tbasic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard-wired and pleasurable . \\nOne brain region , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain , contributes \\tto learning altruistic behavior , especially in those with trait empathy . \\nThe same study has shown a connection between giving \\tto charity and the promotion of social bonding . \\nIn fact , in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers , and that when confronted with moral dilemmas , these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with `` end-justifies-the-means '' answers \\t, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions , but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains . \\nAccording to Adrian Raine , a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California , one of this study 's implications \\tis that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people : `` Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse . \\nWithout that awareness , people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to \\tfind it harder to sort their way through moral thickets . \\nDoes that mean they should be held \\tto different standards of accountability ? '' \\nIn another study , in the 1990s , Dr. Bill Harbaugh , a University of Oregon economist , concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist \\tcolleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr , reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity , although they were able to divide the study group into two groups : `` egoists '' and `` altruists '' . \\nOne of their discoveries was that , though rarely , even some of the considered `` egoists '' sometimes gave more than expected because that would \\thelp others , leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity , such as a person 's environment and values . \\nPsychology \\t. \\nThe International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines `` psychological altruism '' as \\t`` a motivational state with the goal of increasing another 's welfare '' . \\nPsychological altruism is contrasted with `` psychological egoism '' , which \\trefers to the motivation to increase one 's own welfare . \\nThere has been some debate on whether or \\tnot humans are truly capable of psychological altruism . \\nSome definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and \\ta lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors . \\nHowever , because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases \\t, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question . \\nThe social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when \\tbenefits to the self outweigh costs to the self . \\nDaniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this \\tquestion and argues against the social exchange theory . \\nHe identified four major motives : to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person \\t( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism ) . \\nAltruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism , \\tbut the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless . \\nThe `` empathy-altruism hypothesis '' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and \\tis evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering . \\nFeelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress , which compel people to \\treduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need . \\nEmpathy is thus not selfless , since altruism works either as the way to avoid those negative , unpleasant feelings and have positive , pleasant feelings triggered \\tby others ' need for help , or as the way to incentive the gain of social reward or through fear to avoid social punishment by helping . \\nPeople with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided , whereas \\tthose lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another 's suffering . \\nHelping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old \\t, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues . \\nIn psychological research on altruism , studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors \\tsuch as helping , comforting , sharing , cooperation , philanthropy , and community service . \\nResearch has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a \\tperson is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person 's distress . \\nResearch also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering \\taffects the likelihood of helping ( the `` Bystander effect '' ) . \\nGreater numbers of bystanders decrease \\tindividual feelings of responsibility . \\nHowever , a witness with a high level of empathic concern is \\tlikely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders . \\nMany studies have observed the effects of volunteerism ( as a form of altruism ) on happiness and \\thealth and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being . \\nIn a study of older adults , those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction \\tand will to live , and lower in depression , anxiety , and somatization . \\nVolunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health , but physical \\thealth and longevity as well , attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages . \\nOne study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52 % of those who \\tdid not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 % of those who did volunteer experienced one . \\nA study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period , people \\twho volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 % lower likelihood of dying . \\nAfter controlling for prior health status , it was determined \\tthat volunteerism accounted for a 44 % reduction in mortality . \\nMerely being aware of kindness in oneself and \\tothers is also associated with greater well-being . \\nA study that asked participants to count each act of kindness \\tthey performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness . \\nIt is important to note that , while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness \\t, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder . \\nThe relationship between altruistic behavior \\tand happiness is bidirectional . \\nStudies have found that generosity increases linearly \\tfrom sad to happy affective states . \\nStudies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the \\tneeds of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness . \\nFor example , one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others ' demands had an even stronger \\tnegative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one ( although positive effects were still significant ) . \\nAdditionally , while generous acts make people feel good about themselves , it \\tis also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others . \\nStudies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness \\tand is also very important for our well-being . \\nA study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that `` a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in \\tnegative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals , positive affect , offering emotional support , sleep quality , and well-being '' . \\nPathological \\taltruism . \\nPathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme , and either \\tharms the altruistic person , or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good . \\nThe term `` pathological altruism '' was popularised \\tby the book `` Pathological Altruism '' . \\nExamples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals , an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one 's own \\tneeds , hoarding of animals , and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid . \\nSociology \\t. \\n`` Sociologists have long been concerned with \\thow to build the good society '' . \\nThe structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable , philanthropic , and other \\tpro-social , altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field . \\nThe American Sociology Association ( ASA ) acknowledges public sociology saying , `` The intrinsic scientific , policy , \\tand public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies ' is unquestionable '' . \\nThis type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it \\tis organized , and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies . \\nHow altruism is framed , organized , carried out , and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus \\tthat sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and `` build the good society '' . \\nThe motivation of altruism is also the focus of study ; some publications link \\tthe occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims . \\nStudies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online \\texperiments is contagious – people imitate observed generosity of others . \\nReligious \\tviewpoints . \\nMost , if not all , of the world 's \\treligions promote altruism as a very important moral value . \\nBuddhism , Christianity , Hinduism , Islam , Jainism , Judaism , \\tand Sikhism , etc. , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality . \\nBuddhism \\t. \\nAltruism figures prominently \\tin Buddhism . \\nLove and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism , and are focused on all beings equally : love is \\tthe wish that all beings be happy , and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering . \\n`` Many illnesses can be cured by \\tthe one medicine of love and compassion . \\nThese qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness , and the need for \\tthem lies at the very core of our being '' ( Dalai Lama ) . \\nStill , the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view , since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness \\t: `` The more we care for the happiness of others , the greater our own sense of well-being becomes '' ( Dalai Lama ) . \\nIn the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment , Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative ( unhappy ) consequences of our actions \\tderive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment , but from the law of karma , which functions like a natural law of cause and effect . \\nA simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes : if one causes suffering , \\tthen as a natural consequence one would experience suffering ; if one causes happiness , then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness . \\nJainism \\t. \\nThe fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism \\t, not only for humans but for all sentient beings . \\nJainism preaches the view of `` Ahimsa '' – to live \\tand let live , thereby not harming sentient beings , i.e . \\nuncompromising reverence for \\tall life . \\nIt also considers all living \\tthings to be equal . \\nThe first Tirthankara , Rishabhdev , introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings , from extending knowledge and \\texperience to others to donation , giving oneself up for others , non-violence and compassion for all living things . \\nJainism prescribes a path of non-violence to \\tprogress the soul to this ultimate goal . \\nA major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on \\tthe consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors . \\nOne 's unconquered mind with anger , pride ( ego ) , deceit \\t, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans . \\nAnger spoils good relations , pride destroys humility \\t, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything . \\nJainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness , pride by \\thumility , deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment . \\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation , one must practice the \\tfollowing ethical principles ( major vows ) in thought , speech and action . \\nThe degree to which these principles are \\tpracticed is different for householders and monks . \\nThey are : The `` great vows '' ( Mahavrata ) are prescribed for \\tmonks and `` limited vows '' ( Anuvrata ) are prescribed for householders . \\nThe house-holders are encouraged to \\tpractice the above-mentioned five vows . \\nThe monks have to \\tobserve them very strictly . \\nWith consistent practice , it will be possible to \\tovercome the limitations gradually , accelerating the spiritual progress . \\nThe principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas \\twhich limit the capabilities of the soul . \\nJainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the \\tpotential to become `` Siddha '' ( God in Jainism ) . \\nBecause all living beings possess a soul , great \\tcare and awareness is essential in one 's actions . \\nJainism emphasizes the equality of all life , advocating harmlessness \\ttowards all , whether the creatures are great or small . \\nThis policy extends even \\tto microscopic organisms . \\nJainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice \\tand therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders . \\nChristianity \\t. \\nSt Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself ' as \\tmeaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others . \\nConsidering that `` the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship '' and quotes Aristotle that `` the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves '' , \\the concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good , the good of the whole , more than any private good , the good of a part . \\nHowever , he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life—since \\tthe ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude : a more desirable thing than bodily well-being . \\nIn coining the word Altruism , as stated above , Comte was probably opposing \\tthis Thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism . \\nMany biblical authors draw a strong connection between \\tlove of others and love of God . \\n1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman \\t, and that hatred of one 's fellowman is the same as hatred of God . \\nThomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that \\taltruism is but one possible form of love . \\nAn altruistic action is not \\talways a loving action . \\nOord defines altruism as acting for the other 's good , and he agrees with feminists who note \\tthat sometimes love requires acting for one 's own good when the other 's demands undermine overall well-being . \\nGerman philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in \\twhich the strong can help the weak . \\nOne way is a sincere expression of Christian love , `` motivated by a powerful feeling of security , \\tstrength , and inner salvation , of the invincible fullness of one 's own life and existence '' . \\nAnother way is merely `` one of the many modern substitutes for love , ... nothing but \\tthe urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people 's business '' . \\nAt its worst , Scheler says , `` love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred \\t, repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etc. , directed against the opposite phenomena : wealth , strength , power , largesse . '' \\nIslam \\t. \\nIn Islam , the concept `` īthār '' ( إيثار ) ( \\taltruism ) is the notion of `` preferring others to oneself '' . \\nFor Sufis , this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one 's own concerns \\t, where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by Allah ( i.e . \\nGod ) on the human body , \\tconsidered to be property of Allah alone . \\nThe importance of `` īthār '' lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good \\t; Islam considers those practicing `` īthār '' as abiding by the highest degree of nobility . \\nThis is similar to the notion of chivalry , but unlike that European \\tconcept , in `` īthār '' attention is focused on everything in existence . \\nA constant concern for Allah results in a careful attitude towards \\tpeople , animals , and other things in this world . \\nJudaism \\t. \\nJudaism defines altruism as the \\tdesired goal of creation . \\nThe famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that \\tlove is the most important attribute in humanity . \\nThis is defined as bestowal , or giving \\t, which is the intention of altruism . \\nThis can be altruism towards humanity that leads \\tto altruism towards the creator or God . \\nKabbalah defines God as the \\tforce of giving in existence . \\nRabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation ' and how the \\twill of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force . \\nModern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag , in his writings about the \\tfuture generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework . \\nAshlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation , and everything that \\thappens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism , love for one another . \\nAshlag focused on society and \\tits relation to divinity . \\nSikhism \\t. \\nAltruism is essential to \\tthe Sikh religion . \\nThe central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe \\tand live the godly qualities like love , affection , sacrifice , patience , harmony , truthfulness . \\nThe concept of `` seva '' , or selfless service to the \\tcommunity for its own sake , is an important concept in Sikhism . \\nThe fifth Guru , Arjun Dev , sacrificed his life to uphold `` 22 carats \\tof pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity '' , the Guru Granth . \\nThe ninth Guru , Tegh Bahadur , sacrificed his \\thead to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity . \\nIn the late seventeenth century , Guru Gobind Singh ( the tenth Guru in Sikhism ) , was at war with the Mughal \\trulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh , Bhai Kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy . \\nHe gave water to both friends and \\tfoes who were wounded on the battlefield . \\nSome of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors \\twere annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy . \\nSikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh , and complained of \\this action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield . \\n`` What were you doing \\t, and why ? '' \\nasked the \\tGuru . \\n`` I was giving water to the wounded because I saw \\tyour face in all of them '' , replied Bhai Kanhaiya . \\nThe Guru responded , `` Then you should \\talso give them ointment to heal their wounds . \\nYou were practicing what you were coached \\tin the house of the Guru . '' \\nUnder the tutelage of the Guru , Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism , which \\tis still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service . \\nHinduism \\t. \\nIn Hinduism Selflessness ( Atmatyag ) , Love ( Prema ) , Kindness ( Daya ) and \\tForgiveness ( Kshama ) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or `` Manushyattva '' . \\nGiving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or `` Punya '' and Hindus believe it \\twill free their souls from guilt or `` Paapa '' and will led them to heaven or `` Swarga '' in afterlife . \\nAltruism is also the central act of various \\tHindu mythology and religious poems and songs . \\nThe founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint `` Dhnyaneshwar Maharaj '' ( 1275-1296 ) in his `` Pasaydan \\t'' pray to the supreme lord `` Vitthal '' for the wellbeing of all living organisms of the universe . \\nSwami Vivekananda , the legendary Hindu monk , has said - '' Jive prem kare jeijon , \\tSeijon sebiche Iswar '' ( Whoever loves any living being , is serving god . ) . \\nMass donation of clothes to poor people ( Vastraseva ) , or blood donation camp or \\tmass food donation ( Annaseva ) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies . \\nSwami Sivananda , an Advaita scholar , reiterates the views in his \\tcommentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras , a Vedantic text . \\nIn his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras , Sivananda notes that karma is \\tinsentient and short-lived , and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed . \\nHence , karma can not bestow the fruits of actions \\tat a future date according to one 's merit . \\nFurthermore , one can not argue that karma \\tgenerates apurva or punya , which gives fruit . \\nSince apurva is non-sentient , it can not act unless \\tmoved by an intelligent being such as a god . \\nIt can not independently \\tbestow reward or punishment . \\nHowever the very well known and popular text , the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga ( achieving oneness with God through action \\t) & amp ; `` Nishkam Karma '' or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism . \\nAltruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received \\tin Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality . \\nPhilosophy \\t. \\nThere exists a wide range of philosophical views on \\thumans ' obligations or motivations to act altruistically . \\nProponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals \\tare morally obligated to act altruistically . \\nThe opposing view is ethical egoism , which maintains that \\tmoral agents should always act in their own self-interest . \\nBoth ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism , which maintains that each agent should act in \\torder to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants . \\nA related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism , the thesis that \\thumans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible . \\nRational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one 's \\tself-interest ( without specifying how this affects one 's moral obligations ) . \\nEffective \\taltruism . \\nEffective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence \\tand reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others . \\nEffective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in \\tthe way that brings about the greatest positive impact , based upon their values . \\nIt is the broad , evidence-based and cause-neutral approach \\tthat distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity . \\nEffective altruism is part of the \\tlarger movement towards evidence-based practices . \\nWhile a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector , the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the \\tscientific projects , companies , and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives , help people , or otherwise have the biggest benefit . \\nPeople associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer , Facebook co founder Dustin Moskovitz , Cari \\tTuna , Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill and Toby Ord , and professional poker player Liv Boeree . \\nGenetics \\t. \\nThe genes OXTR , CD38 , COMT , DRD4 , DRD5 , IGF2 \\t, and GABRB2 have been found to be candidate genes for altruism . \\nDigital \\taltruism . \\nDigital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of \\treciprocity and in the belief that in the end , everyone benefits from sharing information via the Internet . \\nThis term is coined by Dr. Dana Klisanin , the founder and CEO of Evolutionary Guidance Media R & amp ; D Inc. , and \\tis a recipient of the Early Career Award for Scientific Achievement in Media Psychology from the American Psychological Association 's Division of Media Psychology . \\nAccording to Klisanin , `` the notion that some are \\twilling to freely reveal what they know '' is interesting . \\nTypes of \\tdigital altruism . \\nThere are three types of digital altruism : ( 1 ) `` everyday digital altruism , '' involving expedience , ease , moral engagement , and conformity ; ( 2 ) `` creative \\tdigital altruism , '' involving creativity , heightened moral engagement , and cooperation ; and ( 3 ) `` co-creative digital altruism '' involving creativity , moral engagement , and meta cooperative efforts . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 338 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=338 '' title= '' AutoRacing '' > AutoRacing < /doc > < doc id= '' 339 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=339 '' title= '' \\tAyn Rand '' > Ayn Rand Alice O'Connor ( born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ; , 1905 – March 6 , 1982 ) , better known by her pen name Ayn Rand ( ) , was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher . \\nShe is known for her fiction and for \\tdeveloping a philosophical system she named Objectivism . \\nBorn and educated in Russia , she \\tmoved to the United States in 1926 . \\nAfter two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays , \\tshe achieved fame with her 1943 novel , `` The Fountainhead '' . \\nIn 1957 , Rand published her best-known work \\t, the novel `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nAfterward , until her death in 1982 , she turned to non-fiction to promote \\ther philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays . \\nRand advocated reason as the only means of \\tacquiring knowledge ; she rejected faith and religion . \\nShe supported rational and ethical \\tegoism and rejected altruism . \\nIn politics , she condemned the initiation of force as \\timmoral and opposed collectivism , statism , and anarchism . \\nInstead , she supported `` laissez-faire '' capitalism , which she defined as \\tthe system based on recognizing individual rights , including private property rights . \\nAlthough Rand opposed libertarianism , which she viewed as anarchism , she \\tis often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States . \\nIn art , Rand \\tpromoted romantic realism . \\nShe was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to \\ther , except for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , and classical liberals . \\nRand 's books have sold \\tover 37 million copies . \\nHer fiction received mixed \\treviews from literary critics . \\nAlthough academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death , academic philosophers have generally \\tignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor . \\nHer writings have politically influenced \\tsome right-libertarians and conservatives . \\nThe Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , \\tboth to the public and in academic settings . \\nLife \\t. \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February 2 , 1905 \\t, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg . \\nShe was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich \\tRosenbaum , a pharmacist , and Anna Borisovna ( ) . \\nShe was twelve when the October Revolution and the rule of the \\tBolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously . \\nHer father 's business was confiscated , and the family fled to the city of Yevpatoria in \\tCrimea , which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War . \\nAfter graduating high school there in June 1921 , she returned with her family to Petrograd ( \\tas Saint Petersburg was then named ) , where they faced desperate conditions , occasionally nearly starving . \\nWhen Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution , she was \\tin the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University . \\nAt 16 , she began her studies in the \\tdepartment of social pedagogy , majoring in history . \\nAlong with many other bourgeois students , she \\twas purged from the university shortly before graduating . \\nAfter complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , \\tmany of the purged students were reinstated in the university . \\nRand was among these reinstated students and she completed her \\tstudies at the renamed Leningrad State University in October 1924 . \\nShe then studied for a year at the \\tState Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad . \\nFor an assignment , Rand wrote an essay about the Polish \\tactress Pola Negri , which became her first published work . \\nBy this time , she had decided her professional surname for writing would be `` \\tRand '' , and she adopted the first name `` Ayn '' ( pronounced ) . \\nIn late 1925 , Rand was granted \\ta visa to visit relatives in Chicago . \\nShe departed on January 17 , 1926 , and arrived \\tin New York City on February 19 , 1926 . \\nIntent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter , she lived for \\ta few months with her relatives learning English before leaving for Hollywood , California . \\nIn Hollywood , a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra \\tin his film `` The King of Kings '' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter . \\nWhile working on `` The King of Kings '' , she met an aspiring \\tyoung actor , Frank O'Connor ; the two married on April 15 , 1929 . \\nShe became a permanent American resident in July 1929 \\tand an American citizen on March 3 , 1931 . \\nShe made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the \\tUnited States , but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate . \\nEarly \\tfiction . \\nRand 's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay `` Red \\tPawn '' to Universal Studios in 1932 , although it was never produced . \\nHer courtroom drama `` Night of January 16th '' , first staged \\tin Hollywood in 1934 , reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935 . \\nEach night , a jury was selected from members of the audience ; \\tbased on its vote , one of two different endings would be performed . \\nHer first novel , the semi-autobiographical `` We \\tthe Living '' , was published in 1936 . \\nSet in Soviet Russia , it focused on \\tthe struggle between the individual and the state . \\nInitial sales were slow , and the American publisher let it \\tgo out of print , although European editions continued to sell . \\nShe adapted the story as a stage play , but the Broadway \\tproduction was a failure and closed in less than a week . \\nAfter the success of her later novels , Rand was able to release \\ta revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies . \\nRand started her next major novel , `` The Fountainhead '' , in December 1935 , \\tbut took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella `` Anthem '' . \\nThe novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such \\tan extent that even the word `` I '' has been forgotten and replaced with `` we '' . \\nIt was published in England in 1938 , but Rand \\tcould not find an American publisher at that time . \\nAs with `` We the Living '' , Rand 's later success allowed her to \\tget a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold over 3.5 million copies . \\n`` The Fountainhead '' \\tand political activism . \\nDuring the 1940s , \\tRand became politically active . \\nShe and her husband were full-time volunteers for \\tRepublican Wendell Willkie 's 1940 presidential campaign . \\nThis work brought her into contact with \\tother intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism . \\nShe became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt , who introduced \\ther to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises . \\nDespite philosophical differences with them , Rand strongly endorsed the writings of \\tboth men throughout her career , and they expressed admiration for her . \\nMises once referred to her as `` the most courageous man in America '' , a \\tcompliment that particularly pleased her because he said `` man '' instead of `` woman '' . \\nRand became friends with \\tlibertarian writer Isabel Paterson . \\nRand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings , \\tand gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book , `` The God of the Machine '' . \\nRand 's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with `` The Fountainhead '' , a novel about an uncompromising young architect named \\tHoward Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as `` second-handers '' —those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves . \\nTwelve publishers rejected it before Bobbs-Merrill Company accepted it at the insistence of editor \\tArchibald Ogden , who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it . \\nWhile completing the novel , Rand was \\tprescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue . \\nThe drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel \\t, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks ' rest . \\nHer use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed \\tto what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings . \\nThe success of `` The Fountainhead '' \\tbrought Rand fame and financial security . \\nIn 1943 , she sold the film rights to Warner \\tBros. and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay . \\nProducer Hal B. Wallis hired her \\tafterwards as a screenwriter and script-doctor . \\nHer work for him included the screenplays for `` \\tLove Letters '' and `` You Came Along '' . \\nHer contract with Wallis also allowed time for other projects , including a never-completed nonfiction \\ttreatment of her philosophy to be called `` The Moral Basis of Individualism '' . \\nWhile working in Hollywood , Rand became involved with the anti-Communist Motion Picture Alliance \\tfor the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the group 's behalf . \\nShe also joined the \\tanti-Communist American Writers Association . \\nIn 1947 , during the Second Red Scare , Rand testified as a `` friendly witness '' before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee that the \\t1944 film `` Song of Russia '' grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union , portraying life there as much better and happier than it was . \\nShe also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film `` The Best Years of Our Lives '' for what \\tshe interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but was not allowed to do so . \\nWhen asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations \\t' effectiveness , Rand described the process as `` futile '' . \\nAfter several delays , the film version of \\t`` The Fountainhead '' was released in 1949 . \\nAlthough it used Rand 's screenplay with minimal alterations , she `` disliked the movie from \\tbeginning to end '' and complained about its editing , the acting and other elements . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged \\t'' and Objectivism . \\nFollowing the publication of `` The Fountainhead '' , Rand received many \\tletters from readers , some of whom the book had influenced profoundly . \\nIn 1951 , Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City , where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the Federal \\tReserve Alan Greenspan , a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal ( later Nathaniel Branden ) and his wife Barbara , and Barbara 's cousin Leonard Peikoff . \\nInitially , the group was an informal gathering of friends who \\tmet with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy . \\nLater , Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript \\tdrafts of her new novel , `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nIn 1954 , her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into \\ta romantic affair , with the knowledge of their spouses . \\nPublished in 1957 , `` Atlas Shrugged '' \\tis considered Rand 's `` magnum opus '' . \\nShe described the novel 's theme as `` the role of the mind in man 's existence—and , \\tas a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self-interest '' . \\nIt advocates the core tenets of Rand 's philosophy \\tof Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement . \\nThe plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists , scientists , and artists respond to a \\twelfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy . \\nThe novel 's hero and leader of the strike , John Galt , describes it as stopping `` the motor \\tof the world '' by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nation 's wealth and achievements . \\nThe novel contains an exposition of Objectivism \\tin a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt . \\nDespite many negative reviews , `` Atlas Shrugged '' became an international bestseller \\t, but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' was her last completed work of fiction , marking the end of \\ther career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher . \\nIn 1958 , Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures , later incorporated as the \\tNathaniel Branden Institute ( NBI ) , to promote Rand 's philosophy through public lectures . \\nHe and Rand co-founded `` The Objectivist Newsletter '' ( later renamed `` The Objectivist '' ) in \\t1962 to circulate articles about her ideas ; she later republished some of these articles in book form . \\nRand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict \\tstandards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her . \\nCritics , including some former NBI students and Branden himself , later described the \\tculture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand . \\nSome described the NBI or the Objectivist \\tmovement as a cult or religion . \\nRand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , \\tfrom literature and music to sexuality and facial hair . \\nSome of her followers mimicked her preferences , wearing clothes to \\tmatch characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers . \\nHowever , some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated \\t, and the problem was concentrated among Rand 's closest followers in New York . \\nLater \\tyears . \\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s , Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through \\ther nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities . \\nShe began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall \\tForum , responding to questions from the audience . \\nDuring these appearances , she often took controversial stances \\ton the political and social issues of the day . \\nThese included : supporting abortion rights , opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft ( but condemning many draft dodgers as `` bums '' ) , supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as `` \\tcivilized men fighting savages '' , saying European colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians , and calling homosexuality `` immoral '' and `` disgusting '' , while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it . \\nShe endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States , most strongly Barry Goldwater \\tin 1964 , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for `` The Objectivist Newsletter '' . \\nIn 1964 , Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the \\tyoung actress Patrecia Scott , whom he later married . \\nNathaniel and Barbara Branden kept \\tthe affair hidden from Rand . \\nWhen she learned of it in 1968 , though her romantic relationship with Branden had already \\tended , Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens , and the NBI was closed . \\nShe published an article in `` The Objectivist '' repudiating Nathaniel Branden \\tfor dishonesty and other `` irrational behavior in his private life '' . \\nIn subsequent years , Rand and several \\tmore of her closest associates parted company . \\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in \\t1974 after decades of heavy smoking . \\nIn 1976 , she retired from writing her newsletter and , after her initial objections , \\tallowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare . \\nDuring the late 1970s , her activities within the Objectivist movement declined , \\tespecially after the death of her husband on November 9 , 1979 . \\nOne of her final projects was work on a \\tnever-completed television adaptation of `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nOn March 6 , 1982 , Rand died of \\theart failure at her home in New York City . \\nAt her funeral , a floral arrangement in the shape \\tof a dollar sign was placed near her casket . \\nIn her will , Rand \\tnamed Peikoff as her heir . \\nLiterary approach \\tand influences . \\nRand described her approach to literature \\tas `` romantic realism '' . \\nShe wanted her fiction to present the world `` as it could \\tbe and should be '' , rather than as it was . \\nThis approach led her to create \\thighly stylized situations and characters . \\nHer fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic \\tindividualists , depicted as fit and attractive . \\nHer villains support duty \\tand collectivist moral ideals . \\nRand often describes them as unattractive , and some have names that suggest \\tnegative traits , such as Wesley Mouch in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature , and her stories typically have \\twhat biographer Anne Heller described as `` tight , elaborate , fast-paced plotting '' . \\nRomantic triangles are a common plot element in Rand 's fiction ; in most of her novels \\tand plays , the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men . \\nInfluences \\t. \\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky , Victor Hugo , \\tEdmond Rostand , and Friedrich Schiller , who became her favorites . \\nShe considered them to be among the `` top rank '' of Romantic writers \\tbecause of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots . \\nHugo was an important influence on her \\twriting , especially her approach to plotting . \\nIn the introduction she wrote for an English-language edition of his novel `` Ninety-Three \\t'' , Rand called him `` the greatest novelist in world literature '' . \\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature , her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists \\tand other nineteenth-century Russian writing , most notably the 1863 novel `` What Is to Be Done ? '' \\nby Nikolay \\tChernyshevsky . \\nRand 's experience of the Russian Revolution and early \\tCommunist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains . \\nBeyond `` We the Living '' , which is set in Russia , this influence can be seen in the ideas and \\trhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in `` The Fountainhead '' , and in the destruction of the economy in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nRand 's descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies \\t; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios . \\nThey often follow common film editing conventions , such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene \\tfollowed by close-up details , and her descriptions of women characters often take a `` male gaze '' perspective . \\nPhilosophy \\t. \\nRand called her philosophy `` Objectivism '' , describing its essence as `` the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own \\thappiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute '' . \\nShe considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on \\tmetaphysics , epistemology , ethics , political philosophy , and aesthetics . \\nIn metaphysics , Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she \\tregarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion . \\nRand believed in free will as a \\tform of agent causation and rejected determinism . \\nIn epistemology , Rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axiomatic , \\tand reason , which she described as `` the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man 's senses '' . \\nRand rejected all claims of non-perceptual knowledge , including instinct , ' \\t'intuition , ' 'revelation , ' or any form of 'just knowing . \\nIn her `` Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology '' , Rand presented \\ta theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy . \\nShe believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy \\tof reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy . \\nIn ethics , Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism \\t( rational self-interest ) , as the guiding moral principle . \\nShe said the individual should `` exist for his own sake , \\tneither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself '' . \\nRand referred to egoism as `` the virtue of \\tselfishness '' in her book of that title . \\nIn it , she presented her solution to the is–ought problem by describing a meta-ethical \\ttheory that based morality in the needs of `` man 's survival qua man '' . \\nShe condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , and held the initiation of force \\twas evil and irrational , writing in `` Atlas Shrugged '' that , `` Force and mind are opposites '' . \\nRand 's political philosophy emphasized individual \\trights , including property rights . \\nShe considered `` laissez-faire '' capitalism the only moral social system because in \\ther view it was the only system based on protecting those rights . \\nRand opposed collectivism and statism , which she understood to include many specific forms of government \\t, such as communism , fascism , socialism , theocracy , and the welfare state . \\nHer preferred form of government was a constitutional republic \\tthat is limited to the protection of individual rights . \\nAlthough her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian \\t, Rand preferred the term `` radical for capitalism '' . \\nShe worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed \\twith them over issues such as religion and ethics . \\nRand denounced libertarianism , which \\tshe associated with anarchism . \\nShe rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in \\tsubjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice . \\nIn aesthetics , Rand defined art as a `` selective re-creation \\tof reality according to an artist 's metaphysical value-judgments '' . \\nAccording to her , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete \\tform that can be grasped easily , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness . \\nAs a writer , the art form \\tRand focused on most closely was literature . \\nShe considered romanticism to be the approach that most \\taccurately reflected the existence of human free will . \\nCriticisms \\t. \\nRand 's ethics and politics are the \\tmost criticized areas of her philosophy . \\nNumerous authors , including Robert Nozick and William F. O'Neill , in some of the earliest academic \\tcritiques of her ideas , said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem . \\nCritics have called her definitions of `` egoism '' and \\t`` altruism '' biased and inconsistent with normal usage . \\nCritics from religious traditions oppose her \\tatheism and her rejection of altruism . \\nMultiple critics , including Nozick , have said her \\tattempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails . \\nOthers , like libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer , have gone further , saying that \\ther support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions . \\nSome critics , like Roy Childs , have said that her opposition to the \\tinitiation of force should lead to support of anarchism , rather than limited government . \\nCommentators , including Hazel Barnes , Albert Ellis , and Nathaniel Branden \\t, have criticized Rand 's focus on the importance of reason . \\nBranden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create \\tunrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be . \\nRelationship to \\tother philosophers . \\nExcept for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals , Rand was \\tsharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her . \\nAcknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence , Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she \\tcould only recommend `` three A 's '' —Aristotle , Aquinas , and Ayn Rand . \\nIn a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace , when asked where her philosophy came from , she responded : `` Out of \\tmy own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle , the only philosopher who ever influenced me . '' \\nIn an article for the `` Claremont Review of Books '' , political scientist Charles \\tMurray criticized her claim that her only `` philosophical debt '' was to Aristotle . \\nHe asserted her ideas were derivative of previous \\tthinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche . \\nRand found early inspiration from Nietzsche , and scholars have \\tfound indications of this in Rand 's private journals . \\nIn 1928 , she alluded to his idea of the `` superman '' in notes \\tfor an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman . \\nThere are other indications of Nietzsche 's influence in passages from the first edition of `` We \\tthe Living '' ( which Rand later revised ) , and in her overall writing style . \\nBy the time she wrote `` The Fountainhead '' , Rand had turned against Nietzsche 's ideas \\t, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed . \\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant , whom she referred to as `` the most evil \\tman in mankind 's history '' ; she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self-interest . \\nPhilosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued \\tshe misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences . \\nShe was also critical of Plato , and viewed his differences with Aristotle on \\tquestions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy . \\nRand 's relationship with contemporary \\tphilosophers was mostly antagonistic . \\nShe was not an academic and \\tdid not participate in academic discourse . \\nShe was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she \\tdisagreed with in a polemical manner without in-depth analysis . \\nShe was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers , who \\tdismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration . \\nReception and \\tlegacy . \\nCritical \\treception . \\nThe first reviews Rand received were for \\t`` Night of January 16th '' . \\nReviews of the Broadway production were largely positive , but Rand considered even positive reviews \\tto be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer . \\nAlthough Rand believed that her novel `` We the Living '' was \\tnot widely reviewed , over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews . \\nOverall , they were more positive than \\tthose she received for her later work . \\nHer novella `` Anthem '' received little review attention , both \\tfor its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues . \\nRand 's first bestseller , `` The Fountainhead '' , received far fewer reviews \\tthan `` We the Living '' , and reviewers ' opinions were mixed . \\nLorine Pruette 's positive review in `` The New York Times '' , which called the author `` a writer \\tof great power '' who wrote `` brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly '' , was one that Rand greatly appreciated . \\nThere were other positive reviews , but Rand dismissed most of them \\tfor either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications . \\nSome negative reviews said the novel was too long ; others called \\tthe characters unsympathetic and Rand 's style `` offensively pedestrian '' . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' was widely reviewed , \\tand many of the reviews were strongly negative . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' received positive reviews from a few publications , but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that `` reviewers seemed to vie with each other in \\ta contest to devise the cleverest put-downs '' , with reviews including comments that it was `` written out of hate '' and showed `` remorseless hectoring and prolixity '' . \\nWhittaker Chambers wrote what was later called the novel 's most `` \\tnotorious '' review for the conservative magazine `` National Review '' . \\nHe accused Rand of supporting a godless system ( which he related to that of the Soviets ) , claiming , `` From \\talmost any page of `` Atlas Shrugged '' , a voice can be heard ... commanding : 'To a gas chamber—go ! . \\nRand 's nonfiction received far \\tfewer reviews than her novels . \\nThe tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book , `` For the \\tNew Intellectual '' , was similar to that for `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nPhilosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to `` the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union \\t'' , and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint `` nearly perfect in its immorality '' . \\nThese reviews set the pattern for reaction \\tto her ideas among liberal critics . \\nHer subsequent books got \\tprogressively less review attention . \\nPopular \\tinterest . \\nWith over 37 million copies sold , Rand \\t's books continue to be read widely . \\nA survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club in \\t1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives . \\nRand 's `` Atlas Shrugged '' was the \\tsecond most popular choice , after the Bible . \\nAlthough Rand 's influence has been greatest in the United \\tStates , there has been international interest in her work . \\nRand 's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , like Ira Levin , Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith \\t; she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer , Terry Goodkind , and comic book artist Steve Ditko . \\nRand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many \\tbusiness executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work . \\nBusinessmen such as John Allison of BB & amp ; T and Ed \\tSnider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand 's ideas . \\nTelevision shows , movies , and video games \\thave referred to Rand and her works . \\nThroughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines , as well as \\tbook-length critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W. Robbins . \\nRand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors , \\tincluding Mary Gaitskill , Matt Ruff , Kay Nolte Smith , and Tobias Wolff . \\nNick Gillespie , former editor-in-chief of `` Reason '' , remarked that , `` Rand 's is a \\ttortured immortality , one in which she 's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist . \\nJibes at Rand as cold and inhuman \\trun through the popular culture . '' \\nTwo movies have been made \\tabout Rand 's life . \\nA 1997 documentary film , `` '' , was \\tnominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . \\n`` The Passion of Ayn Rand '' , a 1999 television adaptation \\tof the book of the same name , won several awards . \\nRand 's image also appears on a 1999 \\tU.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano . \\nRand 's works , most commonly `` Anthem '' or `` \\tThe Fountainhead '' , are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading . \\nSince 2002 , the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rand \\t's novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum . \\nThe Institute had distributed 4.5 million copies in the \\tU.S. and Canada by the end of 2020 . \\nIn 2017 , Rand was added to the required reading list \\tfor the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom . \\nPolitical \\tinfluence . \\nAlthough she rejected the labels `` conservative '' and `` libertarian '' \\t, Rand has had a continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism . \\nRand is often considered one of the three most important women ( along with Rose \\tWilder Lane and Isabel Paterson ) in the early development of modern American libertarianism . \\nDavid Nolan , one founder of the Libertarian Party , said that \\t`` without Ayn Rand , the libertarian movement would not exist '' . \\nIn his history of that movement , journalist Brian Doherty described her as `` \\tthe most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large '' . \\nPolitical scientist Andrew Koppelman called her `` \\tthe most widely read libertarian '' . \\nHistorian Jennifer Burns referred to her as `` the \\tultimate gateway drug to life on the right '' . \\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the Republican Party \\t) , despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative , like being pro-choice and an atheist . \\nShe faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley Jr. and other contributors to the conservative \\t`` National Review '' magazine , which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas . \\nNevertheless , a 1987 article in `` The New York Times '' \\treferred to her as the Reagan administration 's `` novelist laureate '' . \\nRepublican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence \\ton their lives and have recommended her novels . \\nShe has influenced some conservative politicians outside the U.S. , such as Sajid Javid in \\tthe United Kingdom , Siv Jensen in Norway , and Ayelet Shaked in Israel . \\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially \\t`` Atlas Shrugged '' , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis . \\nOpinion articles compared real-world events \\twith the novel 's plot . \\nSigns mentioning Rand and her fictional hero \\tJohn Galt appeared at Tea Party protests . \\nThere was increased criticism of her ideas \\t, especially from the political left . \\nCritics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and \\tfree markets , particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan . \\nIn 2015 , Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan , `` Rand had effectively \\tchucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy '' . \\nLisa Duggan said that Rand 's novels had `` incalculable \\timpact '' in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas . \\nIn 2021 , Cass Sunstein said Rand 's ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies \\tof the Trump administration , which he attributed to the `` enduring influence '' of Rand 's fiction . \\nAcademic \\treaction . \\nDuring Rand 's lifetime , her work \\treceived little attention from academic scholars . \\nSince her death , interest in \\ther work has increased gradually . \\nIn 2009 , historian Jennifer Burns identified `` three overlapping waves '' of scholarly \\tinterest in Rand , including `` an explosion of scholarship '' since 2000 . \\nAs of that year , few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with \\tmany literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study . \\nFrom 2002 to 2012 , over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BB & amp ; T Corporation that required teaching \\tRand 's ideas or works ; in some cases , the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about Rand . \\nIn 2020 , media critic Eric Burns said that , `` Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime '' \\t, but `` nobody in the academe pays any attention to her , neither as an author nor a philosopher '' . \\nThat same year , the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held `` \\ta stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule '' her work , but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years . \\nTo her \\tideas . \\nIn 1967 , John Hospers discussed Rand 's ethical ideas in the second \\tedition of his textbook , `` An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis '' . \\nThat same year , Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing \\tObjectivism in her book `` An Existentialist Ethics '' . \\nWhen the first full-length academic book about Rand 's philosophy appeared in 1971 , its author declared writing about \\tRand `` a treacherous undertaking '' that could lead to `` guilt by association '' for taking her seriously . \\nA few articles about Rand 's ideas appeared in academic journals before her \\tdeath in 1982 , many of them in `` The Personalist '' . \\nOne of these was `` On the Randian Argument '' by \\tlibertarian philosopher Robert Nozick , who criticized her meta-ethical arguments . \\nOther philosophers , writing in the same publication \\t, argued that Nozick misstated Rand 's case . \\nIn an article responding to Nozick , Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen defended \\ther positions , but described her style as `` literary , hyperbolic and emotional '' . \\n`` The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand '' , a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by \\tDen Uyl and Rasmussen , was the first academic book about Rand 's ideas published after her death . \\nIn one essay , political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite `` the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage '' , Rand \\t's ethics are `` a most immense achievement , the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought '' . \\nIn 1987 , the Ayn Rand Society was founded \\tas an affiliate of the American Philosophical Association . \\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in `` Contemporary Women Philosophers '' , \\tJenny A. Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand . \\nShe said that Rand 's philosophy `` \\tis regularly omitted from academic philosophy . \\nYet , throughout literary academia , Ayn \\tRand is considered a philosopher . '' \\nWriting in the 1998 edition of the `` Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy '' , political \\ttheorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts . \\nHe said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle 's ethics , and her political theory `` is of little interest \\t'' because it is marred by an `` ill-thought out and unsystematic '' effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism . \\n`` The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies '' , a multidisciplinary , peer-reviewed academic journal \\tdevoted to the study of Rand and her ideas , was established in 1999 . \\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute , Huemer argued very \\tfew people find Rand 's ideas convincing , especially her ethics . \\nHe attributed the attention she receives to her being a `` compelling writer '' , especially as a novelist , \\tnoting that `` Atlas Shrugged '' outsells Rand 's non-fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism . \\nIn 2012 , the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of `` The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies '' , \\tand the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an `` Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies '' series based on the Society 's proceedings . \\nThe Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the `` Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\t'' said that `` only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously '' . \\nThat same year , political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a `` nonperson '' among academics , \\tan attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as `` the traditional academic view '' of Rand . \\nPhilosopher Skye C. Cleary wrote in a 2018 article for `` \\tAeon '' that , `` Philosophers love to hate Ayn Rand . \\nIt 's trendy to scoff at \\tany mention of her . '' \\nHowever , Cleary said that because many people take Rand 's ideas seriously , philosophers `` \\tneed to treat the Ayn Rand phenomenon seriously '' and provide refutations rather than ignoring her . \\nTo her \\tfiction . \\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life \\twas even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy . \\nMimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rand 's novels when she began researching \\ther in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s . \\nSince her death , scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore \\ther work , although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s . \\nSeveral academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her \\tworks , as do popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes . \\nIn `` The Literary Encyclopedia '' entry for Rand written in 2001 , John David \\tLewis declared that `` Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation . '' \\nIn 2019 , Duggan described Rand 's fiction as popular and influential on many readers , despite being easy to criticize for `` \\ther cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots , her rigid moralizing , her middle- to lowbrow aesthetic preferences ... and philosophical strivings '' . \\nObjectivist \\tmovement . \\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute \\t, the Objectivist movement continued in other forms . \\nIn the 1970s , Peikoff \\tbegan delivering courses on Objectivism . \\nIn 1979 , Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called \\t`` The Intellectual Activist '' , which Rand endorsed . \\nShe also endorsed `` The Objectivist Forum '' , a bimonthly magazine founded \\tby Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger , which ran from 1980 to 1987 . \\nIn 1985 , Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand \\tInstitute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand 's ideas and works . \\nIn 1990 , after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff , David Kelley founded \\tthe Institute for Objectivist Studies , now known as The Atlas Society . \\nIn 2001 , historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist \\tScholarship , which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia . \\nSelected \\tworks . \\nFiction and drama : Non-fiction : < /doc > < doc id= '' 340 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ?

curid=344 '' title= '' Allan Dwan '' > Allan Dwan Allan Dwan ( \\tborn Joseph Aloysius Dwan ; April 3 , 1885 – December 28 , 1981 ) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director , producer , and screenwriter . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nBorn Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , Dwan , was the younger son of commercial \\ttraveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan ( 1857–1917 ) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan , née Hunt . \\nThe family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4 , \\t1892 , by ferry from Windsor to Detroit , according to his naturalization petition of August 1939 . \\nHis elder brother , Leo Garnet Dwan \\t( 1883–1964 ) , became a physician . \\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame \\tand then worked for a lighting company in Chicago . \\nHe had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry , and when Essanay \\tStudios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter , he took the job . \\nAt that time , some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend \\twinters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather . \\nSoon , a number of movie companies worked there year-round , \\tand in 1911 , Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood . \\nWhile still in New York , in 1917 he was the founding \\tpresident of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association . \\nCareer \\t. \\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa , \\tCalifornia , from August 1911 to July 1912 . \\nFlying A was one of the first \\tmotion pictures studios in California history . \\nOn August 12 , 2011 , a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue \\tand La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa , California . \\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies , Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful \\tmovies as well as her husband , Douglas Fairbanks , notably in the acclaimed 1922 `` Robin Hood '' . \\nDwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films , and \\tone short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm . \\nThis short , also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise , was produced as a joke , for the April \\t26 , 1925 `` Lambs ' Gambol '' for The Lambs , with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club . \\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies , Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in `` Heidi \\t'' ( 1937 ) and `` Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm '' ( 1938 ) . \\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors , Victor Fleming , who went on to direct `` The Wizard of \\tOz '' and `` Gone With the Wind '' , and Marshall Neilan , who became an actor , director , writer and producer . \\nOver a long career spanning almost 50 years , Dwan directed 125 motion pictures , some of which \\twere highly acclaimed , such as the 1949 box office hit , `` Sands of Iwo Jima '' . \\nHe directed his last \\tmovie in 1961 . \\nHe died in Los Angeles at the age of 96 , and is \\tinterred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery , Mission Hills , California . \\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood \\tWalk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard . \\nDaniel Eagan of `` Film Journal International '' described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema , stating that his \\tstyle `` is so basic as to seem invisible , but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion .

the east by Libya ; to the southeast by Niger ; to the southwest \\tby Mali , Mauritania , and Western Sahara ; to the west by Morocco ; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea . \\nIt is considered part of the \\tMaghreb region of North Africa . \\nIt has a semi-arid geography , with most of the population living in \\tthe fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south . \\nAlgeria covers an area of , making it the world 's tenth largest nation by area , and the largest nation \\tin Africa , being more than 200 times as large as the smallest country in the continent , The Gambia . \\nWith a population of 44 million , Algeria is the ninth-most populous \\tcountry in Africa , and the 32nd-most populous country in the world . \\nThe capital and largest city is Algiers , located \\tin the far north on the Mediterranean coast . \\nAlgeria produced and is linked to many civilizations , empires and dynasties , including ancient Numidians , Phoenicians , Carthaginians , Romans , Vandals , Byzantines , Umayyads , Abbasids , Rustamids , \\tIdrisids , Aghlabids , Fatimids , Zirids , Hammadids , Almoravids , Almohads , Zayyanids , Spaniards , Ottomans and the French colonial empire , with the latter expanded into its present-boundaries . \\nAfter 132 years of being part of France , tensions between France and the local Algerian populace led to the start of the Algerian War which \\tconcluded with Algeria obtaining its independence on 5 July 1962 with the establishment of the People 's Democratic Republic on 20 September of that year . \\nThe official languages of Algeria \\tare Arabic and Berber . \\nThe majority of Algeria 's population \\tis Arab , practicing Islam . \\nThe native Algerian Arabic is \\tthe main spoken language . \\nFrench also serves as an administrative and educational language in \\tsome contexts , but it has no official status . \\nAlgeria is a semi-presidential republic , with local \\tconstituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes . \\nAlgeria is a regional power in North Africa \\t, and a middle power in global affairs . \\nIt has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one \\tof the largest economies on the continent , based largely on energy exports . \\nAlgeria has the world 's sixteenth-largest oil reserves \\tand the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas . \\nSonatrach , the national oil company , is the largest company \\tin Africa , supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe . \\nAlgeria 's military is one of the largest in Africa \\t, and has the largest defence budget on the continent . \\nIt is a member of the African Union , the Arab League , the OIC , OPEC , \\tthe United Nations , and the Arab Maghreb Union , of which it is a founding member . \\nName \\t. \\nOther forms of the name are \\t: , ; ; ; ; . \\nIt is officially the People 's Democratic Republic of Algeria \\t( ; , , ; , abbreviated as RADP ) . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe country 's name derives from the city of Algiers which in turn derives from the Arabic ( , `` The Islands '' ) , \\ta truncated form of the older ( , `` Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe '' ) , employed by medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPrehistory and \\tancient history . \\nAround ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech ( Algeria ) were \\tconsidered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa . \\nStone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be \\t~1.9 million years old , and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4 million years . \\nHence , the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited \\tthe Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought . \\nThe evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa \\t, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa . \\nNeanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian \\tstyles ( 43,000 BC ) similar to those in the Levant . \\nAlgeria was the site of the highest state \\tof development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques . \\nTools of this era , starting about 30,000 BC , are called Aterian ( \\tafter the archaeological site of Bir el Ater , south of Tebessa ) . \\nThe earliest blade industries in North Africa are called \\tIberomaurusian ( located mainly in the Oran region ) . \\nThis industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal \\tregions of the Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC . \\nNeolithic civilization ( animal domestication and agriculture ) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb \\tperhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC . \\nThis life , richly depicted in the Tassili n'Ajjer \\tpaintings , predominated in Algeria until the classical period . \\nThe mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that \\tcame to be called Berbers , who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa . \\nFrom their principal center of power at Carthage , the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast ; by 600 BC \\t, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa , east of Cherchell , Hippo Regius ( modern Annaba ) and Rusicade ( modern Skikda ) . \\nThese settlements served as market \\ttowns as well as anchorages . \\nAs Carthaginian power grew , its impact \\ton the indigenous population increased dramatically . \\nBerber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture , \\tmanufacturing , trade , and political organisation supported several states . \\nTrade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew , but territorial expansion also resulted \\tin the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others . \\nBy the early 4th century BC , Berbers formed \\tthe single largest element of the Carthaginian army . \\nIn the Revolt of the Mercenaries , Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 \\tBC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War . \\nThey succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage 's North African territory , and they \\tminted coins bearing the name Libyan , used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa . \\nThe Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats \\tby the Romans in the Punic Wars . \\nIn 146 BC the city \\tof Carthage was destroyed . \\nAs Carthaginian power waned , the influence \\tof Berber leaders in the hinterland grew . \\nBy the 2nd century BC , several large \\tbut loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged . \\nTwo of them were established in Numidia , \\tbehind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage . \\nWest of Numidia lay Mauretania , which extended across the \\tMoulouya River in modern-day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean . \\nThe high point of Berber civilisation , unequalled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more \\tthan a millennium later , was reached during the reign of Masinissa in the 2nd century BC . \\nAfter Masinissa 's death in 148 BC , the \\tBerber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times . \\nMasinissa 's line survived until 24 AD , when the \\tremaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire . \\nFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans \\t, who founded many colonies in the region . \\nLike the rest of North Africa , Algeria was one of the \\tbreadbaskets of the empire , exporting cereals and other agricultural products . \\nSaint Augustine was the bishop of Hippo Regius ( modern-day Annaba \\t, Algeria ) , located in the Roman province of Africa . \\nThe Germanic Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa \\tin 429 , and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia . \\nThey did not make any significant settlement on the \\tland , as they were harassed by local tribes . \\nIn fact , by the time the Byzantines arrived Leptis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was \\toccupied by the indigenous Laguatan who had been busy facilitating an Amazigh political , military and cultural revival . \\nFurthermore , during the rule of the Romans , Byzantines , Vandals , Carthaginians , and Ottomans \\tthe Berber people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent . \\nThe Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest \\tof North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains . \\nThe collapse of the Western Roman Empire led to the establishment of a native \\tKingdom based in Altava ( modern day Algeria ) known as the Mauro-Roman Kingdom . \\nIt was succeeded by another Kingdom based \\tin Altava , the Kingdom of Altava . \\nDuring the reign of Kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern-day Fez in the \\twest to the western Aurès and later Kairaouan and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east . \\nMiddle \\tAges . \\nAfter negligible resistance from the locals , Muslim Arabs of \\tthe Umayyad Caliphate conquered Algeria in the early 8th century . \\nLarge numbers of the indigenous \\tBerber people converted to Islam . \\nChristians , Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end \\tof the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th . \\nAfter the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate , numerous local dynasties emerged , including the Rustamids \\t, Aghlabids , Fatimids , Zirids , Hammadids , Almoravids , Almohads and the Zayyanids . \\nThe Christians left in three waves : after the initial \\tconquest , in the 10th century and the 11th . \\nThe last were evacuated to Sicily by the Normans and \\tthe few remaining died out in the 14th century . \\nDuring the Middle Ages , North Africa was home to many great scholars , saints and sovereigns including Judah Ibn Quraysh , the first grammarian to mention Semitic \\tand Berber languages , the great Sufi masters Sidi Boumediene ( Abu Madyan ) and Sidi El Houari , and the Emirs Abd Al Mu'min and Yāghmūrasen . \\nIt was during this time that the Fatimids or children of \\tFatima , daughter of Muhammad , came to the Maghreb . \\nThese `` Fatimids '' went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb , Hejaz and the Levant , boasting a secular inner government \\t, as well as a powerful army and navy , made up primarily of Arabs and Levantines extending from Algeria to their capital state of Cairo . \\nThe Fatimid Caliphate began to collapse \\twhen its governors the Zirids seceded . \\nIn order to punish them the Fatimids sent the \\tArab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym against them . \\nThe resultant war is recounted \\tin the epic Tāghribāt . \\nIn Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero Khālīfā Al-Zānatī asks daily , for duels , to defeat \\tthe Hilalan hero Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī and many other Arab knights in a string of victories . \\nThe Zirids , however , were ultimately defeated ushering \\tin an adoption of Arab customs and culture . \\nThe indigenous Amazigh tribes , however , remained largely independent , and depending on tribe , location and \\ttime controlled varying parts of the Maghreb , at times unifying it ( as under the Fatimids ) . \\nThe Fatimid Islamic state , also known as Fatimid Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa , Sicily , Palestine \\t, Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , Egypt , the Red Sea coast of Africa , Tihamah , Hejaz and Yemen . \\nCaliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time , as well as forming \\tpart of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era . \\nThe Berber people historically \\tconsisted of several tribes . \\nThe two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes , \\twho were divided into tribes , and again into sub-tribes . \\nEach region of the Maghreb contained several tribes ( for example , Sanhadja , \\tHouara , Zenata , Masmouda , Kutama , Awarba , and Berghwata ) . \\nAll these tribes made \\tindependent territorial decisions . \\nSeveral Amazigh dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages \\tin the Maghreb and other nearby lands . \\nIbn Khaldun provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region , the Zirid , Ifranid , \\tMaghrawa , Almoravid , Hammadid , Almohad , Merinid , Abdalwadid , Wattasid , Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties . \\nBoth of the Hammadid and Zirid empires as well as the \\tFatimids established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries . \\nThe Zirids ruled land in what is now Algeria , Tunisia \\t, Morocco , Libya , Spain , Malta and Italy . \\nThe Hammadids captured and held important regions such as Ouargla , Constantine , Sfax , Susa \\t, Algiers , Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region . \\nThe Fatimids which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all \\tof North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East . \\nFollowing the Berber revolt numerous independent \\tstates emerged across the Maghreb . \\nIn Algeria the Rustamid \\tKingdom was established . \\nThe Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south , central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all \\tof the modern day Maghreb countries , in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of Mali and included territory in Mauritania . \\nOnce extending their control over all of the Maghreb , part of Spain and briefly over Sicily \\t, originating from modern Algeria , the Zirids only controlled modern Ifriqiya by the 11th century . \\nThe Zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of \\tthe Fatimid caliphs of Cairo . \\nEl Mu'izz the Zirid ruler decided to \\tend this recognition and declared his independence . \\nThe Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms , for example the Maghrawa , a Berber dynasty originating from Algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling \\tover much of Morocco and western Algeria including Fez , Sijilmasa , Aghmat , Oujda , most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in Algeria . \\nAs the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to \\tattempt a direct invasion , they found another means of revenge . \\nBetween the Nile and the Red Sea were living Bedouin \\tnomad tribes expelled from Arabia for their disruption and turbulency . \\nThe Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym for example , who regularly disrupted \\tfarmers in the Nile Valley since the nomads would often loot their farms . \\nThe then Fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he could n't control \\t, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Beduouin tribes . \\nThe Fatimids even gave \\tthem money to leave . \\nWhole tribes set off with women , children \\t, elders , animals and camping equipment . \\nSome stopped on the way , especially in Cyrenaica , where they are still one of the \\tessential elements of the settlement but most arrived in Ifriqiya by the Gabes region , arriving 1051 . \\nThe Zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide , but with each encounter , the last under \\tthe walls of Kairouan , his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield . \\nThe Arabs usually did n't take control over the \\tcities , instead looting them and destroying them . \\nThe invasion kept going , and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of Constantine where they encircled the Qalaa \\tof Banu Hammad ( capital of the Hammadid Emirate ) , as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago . \\nFrom there they gradually gained the \\tupper Algiers and Oran plains . \\nSome of these territories were forcibly taken back by the \\tAlmohads in the second half of the 12th century . \\nThe influx of Bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic , cultural Arabization of \\tthe Maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant . \\nIbn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by \\tBanu Hilal tribes had become completely arid desert . \\nThe Almohads originating from modern day Morocco , although founded by a man originating \\tfrom Algeria known as Abd al-Mu'min would soon take control over the Maghreb . \\nDuring the time of the Almohad Dynasty Abd al-Mu'min 's tribe , the Koumïa , \\twere the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire . \\nDefeating the weakening Almoravid Empire and taking control over Morocco in 1147 , they pushed into Algeria in 1152 , taking control over Tlemcen , \\tOran , and Algiers , wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs , and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern Algeria . \\nFollowing their decisive defeat in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 the Almohads began collapsing , and in 1235 the \\tgovernor of modern-day Western Algeria , Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan declared his independence and established the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Zayyanid dynasty . \\nWarring with the Almohad forces attempting to restore control over Algeria for 13 years , they \\tdefeated the Almohads in 1248 after killing their Caliph in a successful ambush near Oujda . \\nThe Zayyanids retained their control \\tover Algeria for 3 centuries . \\nMuch of the eastern territories of Algeria were under the authority of the Hafsid dynasty , although the \\tEmirate of Bejaia encompassing the Algerian territories of the Hafsids would occasionally be independent from central Tunisian control . \\nAt their peak the Zayyanid kingdom included all of Morocco as its vassal to the west and \\tin the east reached as far as Tunis which they captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin . \\nAfter several conflicts with local Barbary pirates sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans , \\tSpain decided to invade Algeria and defeat the native Kingdom of Tlemcen . \\nIn 1505 , they invaded and captured Mers el Kébir , \\tand in 1509 after a bloody siege , they conquered Oran . \\nFollowing their decisive victories over the Algerians in the western-coastal areas of Algeria \\t, the Spanish decided to get bolder , and invaded more Algerian cities . \\nIn 1510 , they led a series of sieges and attacks , taking over \\tBejaia in a large siege , and leading a semi-successful siege against Algiers . \\nThey also \\tbesieged Tlemcen . \\nIn 1511 , they took control over Cherchell and Jijel , and attacked Mostaganem where although they \\twere n't able to conquer the city , they were able to force a tribute on them . \\nOttoman \\tera . \\nIn 1516 , the Ottoman privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa , who \\toperated successfully under the Hafsids , moved their base of operations to Algiers . \\nThey succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the Spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the \\tChristians , but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions . \\nWhen Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of \\tTlemcen , Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers . \\nThe Ottoman sultan gave him the title of \\tbeylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries . \\nWith the aid of this force and native Algerians , Hayreddin conquered the whole area between \\tConstantine and Oran ( although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792 ) . \\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin 's son Hasan \\t, who assumed the position in 1544 . \\nHe was a Kouloughli or of mixed origins \\t, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse . \\nUntil 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by \\tBeylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits . \\nSubsequently , with the institution of a regular administration , \\tgovernors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms . \\nThe pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit , known \\tin Algeria as the Ojaq who were led by an agha . \\nDiscontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were \\tnot paid regularly , and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha . \\nAs a result , the agha charged the pasha \\twith corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 . \\nPlague had repeatedly struck the \\tcities of North Africa . \\nAlgiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21 , \\tand had high fatalities in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 and 1740–42 . \\nThe Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other \\tnon-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea . \\nThe pirates often took the passengers and crew on the \\tships and sold them or used them as slaves . \\nThey also did a brisk business \\tin ransoming some of the captives . \\nAccording to Robert Davis , from the 16th to 19th century \\t, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves . \\nThey often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell \\tat slave markets in North Africa and other parts of the Ottoman Empire . \\nIn 1544 , for example , Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the island of Ischia , taking \\t4,000 prisoners , and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari , almost the entire population . \\nIn 1551 , the Ottoman governor of Algiers , Turgut Reis \\t, enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo . \\nBarbary pirates often attacked \\tthe Balearic Islands . \\nThe threat was so severe that \\tresidents abandoned the island of Formentera . \\nThe introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the \\t17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic . \\nIn July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of Dutch \\tpirate Jan Janszoon sailed as far as Iceland , raiding and capturing slaves . \\nTwo weeks earlier another pirate ship from Salé \\tin Morocco had also raided in Iceland . \\nSome of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back \\tto Iceland , but some chose to stay in Algeria . \\nIn 1629 , pirate ships from \\tAlgeria raided the Faroe Islands . \\nIn 1671 , the taifa of raises , or the company of corsair captains \\trebelled , killed the agha , and placed one of its own in power . \\nThe new leader received \\tthe title of Dey . \\nAfter 1689 , the right to select the dey passed \\tto the divan , a council of some sixty nobles . \\nIt was at first dominated by the `` ojaq '' ; but \\tby the 18th century , it had become the dey 's instrument . \\nIn 1710 , the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and \\this successors as regent , replacing the pasha in that role . \\nAlthough Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire , in reality they acted independently from the rest of \\tthe Empire , and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the Beylik of Tunis . \\nThe dey was in \\teffect a constitutional autocrat . \\nThe dey was elected for a life term , but in the 159 years ( 1671–1830 \\t) that the system was in place , fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated . \\nDespite usurpation , military coups and occasional mob rule , \\tthe day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly . \\nAlthough the regency patronised the tribal chieftains , it never had the \\tunanimous allegiance of the countryside , where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest . \\nAutonomous tribal states were tolerated , and the regency 's authority was seldom applied in the Kabylia , \\talthough in 1730 the Regency was able to take control over the Kingdom of Kuku in western Kabylia . \\nMany cities in the northern parts of the Algerian desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys , although \\tthey otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control , while the deeper parts of the Sahara were completely independent from Algiers . \\nBarbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping , and \\tas a result , the Spanish Navy bombarded Algiers in 1783 and 1784 . \\nFor the attack in 1784 , the Spanish fleet was to be joined by ships \\tfrom such traditional enemies of Algiers as Naples , Portugal and the Knights of Malta . \\nOver 20,000 cannonballs were fired , much of the city and its \\tfortifications were destroyed and most of the Algerian fleet was sunk . \\nIn 1792 , Algiers took back Oran and Mers el \\tKébir , the two last Spanish strongholds in Algeria . \\nIn the same year , they conquered the Moroccan Rif \\tand Oujda , which they then abandoned in 1795 . \\nIn the 19th century , Algerian pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers , paying \\ta `` license tax '' in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels . \\nAttacks by Algerian pirates on American merchantmen resulted in the First and Second \\tBarbary Wars , which ended the attacks on U.S. ships in 1815 . \\nA year later , a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet , under the command \\tof Lord Exmouth bombarded Algiers to stop similar attacks on European fishermen . \\nThese efforts proved successful , although Algerian piracy \\twould continue until the French conquest in 1830 . \\nFrench colonization ( \\t1830–1962 ) . \\nUnder the pretext of a slight to their consul \\t, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830 . \\nHistorian Ben Kiernan wrote on the French conquest of Algeria \\t: `` By 1875 , the French conquest was complete . \\nThe war had killed approximately 825,000 \\tindigenous Algerians since 1830 . '' \\nFrench losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead \\tin the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action . \\nThe population of Algeria , which stood at about 2.9 \\tmillion in 1872 , reached nearly 11 million in 1960 . \\nFrench policy was predicated on \\t`` civilising '' the country . \\nThe slave trade and piracy in \\tAlgeria ceased following the French conquest . \\nThe conquest of Algeria by the French took \\tsome time and resulted in considerable bloodshed . \\nA combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian \\tpopulation to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872 . \\nOn 17 September 1860 , Napoleon III declared `` Our first duty is to take care of the \\thappiness of the three million Arabs , whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination . '' \\nDuring this time , only Kabylia resisted , the Kabylians \\twere not colonized until after the Mokrani Revolt in 1871 . \\nFrom 1848 until independence , France administered the whole Mediterranean region of \\tAlgeria as an integral part and `` département '' of the nation . \\nOne of France 's longest-held overseas territories , Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of \\tEuropean immigrants , who became known as `` colons '' and later , as `` Pied-Noirs . '' \\nBetween 1825 and 1847 , 50,000 \\tFrench people emigrated to Algeria . \\nThese settlers benefited from the French government 's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples \\t, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land . \\nMany Europeans settled in Oran and Algiers , and by the early \\t20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities . \\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century , the \\tEuropean share was almost a fifth of the population . \\nThe French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of \\tFrance , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 . \\nThe indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency , but in contrast to the other colonized countries \\t' path in central Asia and Caucasus , Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture . \\nDuring the Second World War , Algeria came under Vichy control before being liberated by the Allies in \\tOperation Torch , which saw the first large-scale deployment of American troops in the North African campaign . \\nGradually , dissatisfaction among the Muslim population , which lacked political and economic status under the \\tcolonial system , gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France . \\nIn May 1945 , the uprising against the occupying French forces was \\tsuppressed through what is now known as the Sétif and Guelma massacre . \\nTensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 , when the first violent events of \\twhat was later called the Algerian War began after the publication of the Declaration of 1 November 1954 . \\nHistorians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed \\tby the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) or by lynch mobs in Algeria . \\nThe FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as \\tpart of its war , and the French conducted severe reprisals . \\nIn addition , the French destroyed over 8,000 villages \\tand relocated over 2 million Algerians to concentration camps . \\nThe war led to the death of hundreds of \\tthousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries . \\nHistorians , like Alistair Horne and Raymond Aron , state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than \\tthe original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence . \\nHorne estimated Algerian casualties during the span \\tof eight years to be around 700,000 . \\nThe war uprooted more \\tthan 2 million Algerians . \\nThe war against French rule concluded in 1962 , when Algeria gained complete \\tindependence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum . \\nThe first three decades of \\tindependence ( 1962–1991 ) . \\nThe number of European `` Pied-Noirs '' who fled \\tAlgeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964 . \\nThe exodus to mainland France accelerated after the Oran massacre of 1962 , in which \\thundreds of militants entered European sections of the city , and began attacking civilians . \\nAlgeria 's first president was the Front de Libération \\tNationale ( FLN ) leader Ahmed Ben Bella . \\nMorocco 's claim to portions of western Algeria \\tled to the Sand War in 1963 . \\nBen Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari \\tBoumédiène , his former ally and defence minister . \\nUnder Ben Bella , the government had become increasingly \\tsocialist and authoritarian ; Boumédienne continued this trend . \\nHowever , he relied much more on the army for his support \\t, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role . \\nHe collectivised agriculture and launched \\ta massive industrialisation drive . \\nOil extraction facilities \\twere nationalised . \\nThis was especially beneficial to the leadership \\tafter the international 1973 oil crisis . \\nBoumédienne 's successor , Chadli Bendjedid \\t, introduced some liberal economic reforms . \\nHe promoted a policy of Arabisation \\tin Algerian society and public life . \\nTeachers of Arabic , brought in from other Muslim countries , spread conventional Islamic \\tthought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam . \\nThe Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil , leading to \\thardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut . \\nEconomic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during \\tthe 1980s ; by the end of the decade , Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system . \\nPolitical parties developed , such as the Islamic Salvation Front \\t( FIS ) , a broad coalition of Muslim groups . \\nCivil War ( 1991–2002 \\t) and aftermath . \\nIn December 1991 the Islamic Salvation Front dominated \\tthe first of two rounds of legislative elections . \\nFearing the election of an Islamist government , the authorities \\tintervened on 11 January 1992 , cancelling the elections . \\nBendjedid resigned and a High Council of State \\twas installed to act as the Presidency . \\nIt banned the FIS , triggering a civil insurgency between the Front 's armed wing , the Armed Islamic \\tGroup , and the national armed forces , in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died . \\nThe Islamist militants conducted a \\tviolent campaign of civilian massacres . \\nAt several points in the conflict , the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern , most \\tnotably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight 8969 , a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group . \\nThe Armed Islamic Group declared \\ta ceasefire in October 1997 . \\nAlgeria held elections in 1999 , considered biased by international observers \\tand most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika . \\nHe worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a `` Civil Concord '' initiative , approved in a referendum , under which many political \\tprisoners were pardoned , and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty , in force until 13 January 2000 . \\nThe AIS disbanded and levels \\tof insurgent violence fell rapidly . \\nThe Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat ( GSPC ) , a splinter \\tgroup of the Armed Islamic Group , continued a terrorist campaign against the Government . \\nBouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election \\tafter campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation . \\nThe programme comprised economic , institutional , political and social reform to modernise \\tthe country , raise living standards , and tackle the causes of alienation . \\nIt also included a second amnesty initiative , the Charter for Peace and \\tNational Reconciliation , which was approved in a referendum in September 2005 . \\nIt offered amnesty to most \\tguerrillas and Government security forces . \\nIn November 2008 , the Algerian Constitution was amended following a \\tvote in Parliament , removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents . \\nThis change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 \\tpresidential elections , and he was re-elected in April 2009 . \\nDuring his election campaign and following his re-election , Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $ 150-billion spending programme to \\tcreate three million new jobs , the construction of one million new housing units , and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes . \\nA continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010 \\t, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa . \\nOn 24 February 2011 , the government \\tlifted Algeria 's 19-year-old state of emergency . \\nThe government enacted legislation dealing with political parties , the electoral \\tcode , and the representation of women in elected bodies . \\nIn April 2011 , Bouteflika promised \\tfurther constitutional and political reform . \\nHowever , elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international \\thuman rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue . \\nOn 2 April 2019 , Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after \\tmass protests against his candidacy for a fifth term in office . \\nIn December 2019 , Abdelmadjid Tebboune became Algeria 's president , after winning the first round of the presidential \\telection with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria 's democracy in 1989 . \\nTebboune is accused to be close to the \\tmilitary and being loyal to the deposed president . \\nTebboune rejects these accusations , claiming to \\tbe the victim of a witch hunt . \\nHe also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government \\tin August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison . \\nGeography \\t. \\nSince the 2011 breakup of Sudan , and the creation of South Sudan , \\tAlgeria has been the largest country in Africa , and the Mediterranean Basin . \\nIts southern part includes a \\tsignificant portion of the Sahara . \\nTo the north , the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas , further south , two \\tparallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound , and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands . \\nBoth Atlas tend to \\tmerge in eastern Algeria . \\nThe vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the \\tentire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border . \\nThe highest point is \\tMount Tahat ( ) . \\nAlgeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°N ( a small area is north \\tof 37°N and south of 19°N ) , and longitudes 9°W and 12°E . \\nMost of the coastal area is hilly , sometimes even \\tmountainous , and there are a few natural harbours . \\nThe area from the coast to \\tthe Tell Atlas is fertile . \\nSouth of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the \\tSaharan Atlas ; farther south , there is the Sahara desert . \\nThe Hoggar Mountains ( ) , also known as the Hoggar \\t, are a highland region in central Sahara , southern Algeria . \\nThey are located about south of the capital \\t, Algiers , and just east of Tamanghasset . \\nAlgiers , Oran , Constantine , and \\tAnnaba are Algeria 's main cities . \\nClimate and \\thydrology . \\nIn this region , midday desert \\ttemperatures can be hot year round . \\nAfter sunset , however , the clear , dry air permits rapid \\tloss of heat , and the nights are cool to chilly . \\nEnormous daily ranges in \\ttemperature are recorded . \\nRainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas , \\tranging from annually , the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east . \\nPrecipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria \\t, where it reaches as much as in some years . \\nFarther inland , the \\trainfall is less plentiful . \\nAlgeria also has ergs , or \\tsand dunes , between mountains . \\nAmong these , in the summer time when winds are \\theavy and gusty , temperatures can go up to . \\nFauna and \\tflora . \\nThe varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal , mountainous and grassy \\tdesert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife . \\nMany of the creatures comprising the Algerian \\twildlife live in close proximity to civilisation . \\nThe most commonly seen animals include the wild boars , jackals , and gazelles , \\talthough it is not uncommon to spot fennecs ( foxes ) , and jerboas . \\nAlgeria also has a small African leopard and Saharan \\tcheetah population , but these are seldom seen . \\nA species of deer , the Barbary stag , \\tinhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas . \\nThe fennec fox is the \\tnational animal of Algeria . \\nA variety of bird species makes the \\tcountry an attraction for bird watchers . \\nThe forests are inhabited \\tby boars and jackals . \\nBarbary macaques are the \\tsole native monkey . \\nSnakes , monitor lizards , and numerous other reptiles can be found living \\tamong an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria . \\nMany animals are now extinct , including the \\tBarbary lions , Atlas bears and crocodiles . \\nIn the north , some of the native flora includes Macchia \\tscrub , olive trees , oaks , cedars and other conifers . \\nThe mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ( Aleppo pine \\t, juniper , and evergreen oak ) and some deciduous trees . \\nFig , eucalyptus , agave , and various \\tpalm trees grow in the warmer areas . \\nThe grape vine is \\tindigenous to the coast . \\nIn the Sahara region , \\tsome oases have palm trees . \\nAcacias with wild olives are the predominant \\tflora in the remainder of the Sahara . \\nAlgeria had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of \\t5.22/10 , ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries . \\nCamels are used extensively ; the desert also abounds with \\tvenomous and nonvenomous snakes , scorpions , and numerous insects . \\nGovernment and \\tpolitics . \\nElected politicians have relatively \\tlittle sway over Algeria . \\nInstead , a group of unelected civilian and military `` décideurs '' ( `` deciders '' ) , known as `` \\tle pouvoir '' ( `` the power '' ) , actually rule the country , even deciding who should be president . \\nThe most powerful man might have been Mohamed Mediène , the head of \\tmilitary intelligence , before he was brought down during the 2019 protests . \\nIn recent years , many of these generals \\thave died , retired , or been imprisoned . \\nAfter the death of General Larbi Belkheir , previous president Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts , notably at Sonatrach \\t, and secured constitutional amendments that made him re-electable indefinitely , until he was brought down in 2019 during protests . \\nThe head of state is the President of Algeria \\t, who is elected for a five-year term . \\nThe president is limited \\tto two five-year terms . \\nThe most recent presidential election was planned to be in April 2019 , but widespread protests erupted on 22 February against \\tthe president 's decision to participate in the election , which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April . \\nAbdelmadjid Tebboune , an independent candidate , was elected as president \\tafter the election eventually took place on 12 December 2019 . \\nProtestors refused to recognise Tebboune as president , citing \\tdemands for comprehensive reform of the political system . \\nAlgeria has universal suffrage at \\t18 years of age . \\nThe President is the head of the army , \\tthe Council of Ministers and the High Security Council . \\nHe appoints the Prime Minister who \\tis also the head of government . \\nThe Algerian parliament is bicameral ; the lower house , the People 's National Assembly , has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms , while the upper house \\t, the Council of the Nation , has 144 members serving six-year terms , of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president . \\nAccording to the constitution , no political association may be formed if it is `` based \\ton differences in religion , language , race , gender , profession , or region '' . \\nIn addition , political campaigns must \\tbe exempt from the aforementioned subjects . \\nParliamentary elections were last \\theld in May 2017 . \\nIn the elections , the FLN lost 44 of its seats , but remained the largest party with 164 seats , \\tthe military-backed National Rally for Democracy won 100 , and the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Movement of the Society for Peace won 33 . \\nForeign \\trelations . \\nAlgeria is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( \\tENP ) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer . \\nGiving incentives and rewarding best performers , as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner , \\tare the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument ( ENI ) that came into force in 2014 . \\nIt has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides \\tthe bulk of funding through a number of programmes . \\nIn 2009 , the French government agreed to \\tcompensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria . \\nDefence Minister Herve Morin stated that `` It 's time for our country to be at peace with itself , \\tat peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations , '' when presenting the draft law on the payouts . \\nAlgerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first \\tstep and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation . \\nTensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening \\tthe Arab Maghreb Union , nominally established in 1989 , but which has carried little practical weight . \\nOn 24 August 2021 , Algeria announced \\tthe break of diplomatic relations with Morocco . \\nMilitary \\t. \\nThe military of Algeria consists of the People 's National Army ( ANP ) , the Algerian National Navy \\t( MRA ) , and the Algerian Air Force ( QJJ ) , plus the Territorial Air Defence Forces . \\nIt is the direct successor of the National Liberation Army ( Armée de Libération Nationale or ALN ) , the armed \\twing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation during the Algerian War of Independence ( 1954–62 ) . \\nTotal military personnel include 147,000 active , 150,000 reserve \\t, and 187,000 paramilitary staff ( 2008 estimate ) . \\nService in the military is compulsory for men aged \\t19–30 , for a total of 12 months . \\nThe military expenditure was 4.3 % of the \\tgross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2012 . \\nAlgeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the \\tlargest defence budget in Africa ( $ 10 billion ) . \\nMost of Algeria 's weapons are imported from Russia \\t, with whom they are a close ally . \\nIn 2007 , the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase \\t49 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $ 1.9 billion . \\nRussia is also building two \\t636-type diesel submarines for Algeria . \\nHuman \\trights . \\nAlgeria has been categorised by the US government funded Freedom House as `` not free '' since it began publishing such ratings in \\t1972 , with the exception of 1989 , 1990 , and 1991 , when the country was labelled `` partly free . '' \\nIn December 2016 , the `` Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor '' \\tissued a report regarding violation of media freedom in Algeria . \\nIt clarified that the Algerian government imposed restrictions on freedom of the press ; expression ; and right \\tto peaceful demonstration , protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the media and websites . \\nDue to the fact that the journalists and activists criticise the \\truling government , some media organisations ' licenses are cancelled . \\nIndependent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the \\tgovernment , with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed . \\nIn 2016 , a number of unions , many of which were involved \\tin the 2010–2012 Algerian Protests , have been deregistered by the government . \\nHomosexuality is illegal \\tin Algeria . \\nPublic homosexual behavior is punishable by \\tup to two years in prison . \\nDespite this , about 26 % of Algerians think that homosexuality should be accepted \\t, according to the survey conducted by the BBC News Arabic-Arab Barometer in 2019 . \\nAlgeria showed largest LGBT acceptance compared to other \\tArab countries where the survey was conducted . \\nHuman Rights Watch has accused the Algerian authorities of using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to prevent pro-democracy \\tmovements and protests in the country , leading to the arrest of youths as part of social distancing . \\nAdministrative \\tdivisions . \\nAlgeria is divided into 58 provinces ( `` wilayas '' ) , 553 districts \\t( `` daïras '' ) and 1,541 municipalities ( `` baladiyahs '' ) . \\nEach province , district , and municipality is named after \\tits seat , which is usually the largest city . \\nThe administrative divisions have changed \\tseveral times since independence . \\nWhen introducing new provinces , the numbers of old \\tprovinces are kept , hence the non-alphabetical order . \\nWith their official numbers , currently ( \\tsince 1983 ) they are Economy . \\nAlgeria 's currency is the \\tdinar ( DZD ) . \\nThe economy remains dominated by the state , a \\tlegacy of the country 's socialist post-independence development model . \\nIn recent years , the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned \\tindustries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy . \\nThese restrictions are just starting to be lifted off \\trecently although questions about Algeria 's slowly-diversifying economy remain . \\nAlgeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part \\tbecause of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy . \\nThe government 's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the \\tenergy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages . \\nThe country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems , including the need to diversify the economy \\t, strengthen political , economic and financial reforms , improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions . \\nA wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to \\toffer more than $ 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases . \\nPublic spending has increased by 27 % \\tannually during the past 5 years . \\nThe 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US $ 286 billion \\t, 40 % of which will go to human development . \\nThanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues , Algeria has a cushion of $ \\t173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund . \\nIn addition , Algeria 's external debt is \\textremely low at about 2 % of GDP . \\nThe economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth , and , despite high foreign exchange reserves ( US $ 178 billion , equivalent to \\tthree years of imports ) , current expenditure growth makes Algeria 's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues . \\nAlgeria has not joined the WTO , despite several years of negotiations but is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area and the African Continental Free \\tTrade Area , and has an association agreement with the European Union Turkish direct investments have accelerated in Algeria , with total value reaching $ 5 billion . \\nAs of 2022 , the number of Turkish \\tcompanies present in Algeria has reached 1,400 . \\nIn 2020 , despite the pandemic , more \\tthan 130 Turkish companies were created in Algeria . \\nOil and \\tnatural resources . \\nAlgeria , whose economy is reliant on petroleum \\t, has been an OPEC member since 1969 . \\nIts crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day , but it is \\talso a major gas producer and exporter , with important links to Europe . \\nHydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy , accounting for roughly 60 % \\tof budget revenues , 30 % of GDP , and 87.7 % of export earnings . \\nAlgeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in \\tthe world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter . \\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in \\t2005 , Algeria had of proven natural-gas reserves . \\nIt also ranks 16th \\tin oil reserves . \\nNon-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was \\tprojected at 5 % . \\nTo cope with social demands , the authorities raised expenditure , especially on basic \\tfood support , employment creation , support for SMEs , and higher salaries . \\nHigh hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account \\tand the already large international reserves position . \\nIncome from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing \\thigh oil prices , though the trend in production volume is downwards . \\nProduction from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume , continues to decline \\t, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011 . \\nNevertheless , the sector accounted for 98 % of the total volume of exports in 2011 , against \\t48 % in 1962 , and 70 % of budgetary receipts , or US $ 71.4 billion . \\nThe Algerian national oil company is Sonatrach , which plays a key role \\tin all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria . \\nAll foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach \\t, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements . \\nAccess to biocapacity in Algeria \\tis lower than world average . \\nIn 2016 , Algeria had 0.53 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its \\tterritory , much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . \\nIn 2016 , Algeria used 2.4 global hectares of \\tbiocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption . \\nThis means they use just under 4.5 \\ttimes as much biocapacity as Algeria contains . \\nAs a result , Algeria \\tis running a biocapacity deficit . \\nIn April 2022 , diplomats from Italy and Spain held talks after Rome \\t's move to secure large volume of Algerian gas stoked concerns in Madrid . \\nUnder the deal between Algeria 's Sonatrach and Italy 's Eni , Algeria will send an \\tadditional 9 billion cubic metres of gas to Italy by next year and in 2024 . \\nResearch and alternative \\tenergy sources . \\nAlgeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars \\ttowards developing research facilities and paying researchers . \\nThis development program is meant to advance alternative \\tenergy production , especially solar and wind power . \\nAlgeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean , so \\tthe government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel . \\nCurrently , Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over \\t780 research labs , with state-set goals to expand to 1,000 . \\nBesides solar energy , areas of research in Algeria include \\tspace and satellite telecommunications , nuclear power and medical research . \\nLabour \\tmarket . \\nThe overall rate of unemployment was 10 % in 2011 , but remained higher among young \\tpeople , with a rate of 21.5 % for those aged between 15 and 24 . \\nThe government strengthened in 2011 the job programs introduced in 1988 , in particular in the \\tframework of the program to aid those seeking work ( Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle ) . \\nDespite a decline in total unemployment , \\tyouth and women unemployment is high . \\nTourism \\t. \\nThe development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities , but since \\t2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built . \\nThere are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qal ' a of Beni Hammad , the first capital of the Hammadid empire ; Tipasa , a Phoenician and later Roman \\ttown ; and Djémila and Timgad , both Roman ruins ; M'Zab Valley , a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis ; and the Casbah of Algiers , an important citadel . \\nThe only natural World Heritage Site is \\tthe Tassili n'Ajjer , a mountain range . \\nTransport \\t. \\nThe Algerian road network is the densest in Africa ; its length is estimated at \\tof highways , with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85 % . \\nThis network will be complemented by the East-West Highway \\t, a major infrastructure project currently under construction . \\nIt is a 3-way , highway , linking Annaba in \\tthe extreme east to the Tlemcen in the far west . \\nAlgeria is also crossed by the Trans-Sahara \\tHighway , which is now completely paved . \\nThis road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries \\tcrossed : Algeria , Mali , Niger , Nigeria , Chad , and Tunisia . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nAlgeria has a population of an estimated 44 million , of which \\tthe majority , 75 % to 85 % are ethnically Arab . \\nAt the outset of the 20th century \\t, its population was approximately four million . \\nAbout 90 % of Algerians live in the northern , coastal area ; the inhabitants of the \\tSahara desert are mainly concentrated in oases , although some 1.5 million remain nomadic or partly nomadic . \\n28.1 % of Algerians are \\tunder the age of 15 . \\nBetween 90,000 and 165,000 Sahrawis from Western Sahara live in the \\tSahrawi refugee camps , in the western Algerian Sahara desert . \\nThere are also more than 4,000 Palestinian refugees , who are well integrated and have \\tnot asked for assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . \\nIn 2009 , 35,000 Chinese \\tmigrant workers lived in Algeria . \\nThe largest concentration of Algerian migrants outside Algeria is in France , which \\thas reportedly over 1.7 million Algerians of up to the second generation . \\nEthnic \\tgroups . \\nArabs and indigenous Berbers as well as Phoenicians , Romans , Vandals , Byzantine Greeks , Turks \\t, various Sub-Saharan Africans , and French have contributed to the history and culture of Algeria . \\nDescendants of Andalusian refugees are also present in \\tthe population of Algiers and other cities . \\nMoreover , Spanish was spoken by these Aragonese and Castillian Morisco descendants deep into the 18th century , and \\teven Catalan was spoken at the same time by Catalan Morisco descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued . \\nThe majority of the population of Algeria are Arabs ( \\t75 % to 85 % of the population ) . \\nBerbers who make up 15 % to 20 % of \\tthe population are divided into many groups with varying languages . \\nThe largest of these are the Kabyles , who live in the Kabylie region east of Algiers , the \\tChaoui of Northeast Algeria , the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the Shenwa people of North Algeria . \\nDuring the colonial period , there was a large ( 10 % \\tin 1960 ) European population who became known as `` Pied-Noirs '' . \\nThey were primarily of French \\t, Spanish and Italian origin . \\nAlmost all of this population left during the \\twar of independence or immediately after its end . \\nLanguages \\t. \\nModern Standard Arabic and Berber \\tare the official languages . \\nAlgerian Arabic ( Darja ) is the language \\tused by the majority of the population . \\nColloquial Algerian Arabic has some Berber loanwords which represent \\t8 % to 9 % of its vocabulary . \\nBerber has been recognised as a `` national language \\t'' by the constitutional amendment of 8 May 2002 . \\nKabyle , the predominant Berber language , is taught and is partially \\tco-official ( with a few restrictions ) in parts of Kabylie . \\nKabyle has a significant Arabic , French , Latin , Greek , Phoenician and \\tPunic substratum , and Arabic loanwords represent 35 % of the total Kabyle vocabulary . \\nIn February 2016 , the Algerian constitution passed a \\tresolution that made Berber an official language alongside Arabic . \\nAlthough French has no official status in Algeria , it has one of the largest Francophone populations in the world , and French is widely used in government , \\tmedia ( newspapers , radio , local television ) , and both the education system ( from primary school onwards ) and academia due to Algeria 's colonial history . \\nIt can be regarded as \\ta lingua franca of Algeria . \\nIn 2008 , 11.2 million Algerians \\tcould read and write in French . \\nAn Abassa Institute study in April 2000 found that 60 % of households could speak and understand \\tFrench , or 18 million people out of a total of 30 million at the time . \\nFollowing a period during which the Algerian government tried to phase out French , in recent decades the government \\thas changed course and reinforced the study of French , and some television programs are broadcast in the language . \\nAlgeria emerged as a \\tbilingual state after 1962 . \\nColloquial Algerian Arabic is spoken by about 83 % \\tof the population and Berber by 27 % . \\nReligion \\t. \\nIslam is the predominant religion in Algeria , with its adherents , mostly Sunnis , accounting for 99 % of the \\tpopulation according to a 2021 CIA `` World Factbook '' estimate , and 97.9 % according to Pew Research in 2020 . \\nThere are about 290,000 Ibadis in the \\tM'zab Valley in the region of Ghardaia . \\nPrior to independence , Algeria was home to more than \\t1.3 million Christians ( mostly of French ancestry ) . \\nMany Christian settlers left to France \\tafter the independence from France . \\nToday , estimates of the Christian \\tpopulation range from 20,000 to 200,000 . \\nAlgerian citizens who are Christians predominantly belong to Protestant groups , which have \\tseen increased pressure from the government in recent years including many forced closures . \\nAccording to the Arab Barometer in 2018-2019 , the vast majority \\tof Algerians ( 99.1 % ) continue to identify as Muslim . \\nThe June 2019 Arab Barometer-BBC News report found that the percentage of Algerians identifying as \\tnon-religious has grown from around 8 % in 2013 to around 15 % in 2018 . \\nThe Arab Barometer December 2019 , found that the growth in the percentage of Algerians identifying as \\tnon-religious is largely driven by young Algerians , with roughly 25 % describing themselves as non-religious . \\nHowever , the 2021 Arab Barometer report found that those who said they were \\tnot religious among Algerians has decreased , with just 2.6 % identifying as non-religious . \\nIn that same report , 69.5 % of Algerians identified \\tas religious and another 27.8 % identifying as somewhat religious . \\nAlgeria has given the Muslim world a number of prominent thinkers , including Emir Abdelkader \\t, Abdelhamid Ben Badis , Mouloud Kacem Naît Belkacem , Malek Bennabi and Mohamed Arkoun . \\nHealth \\t. \\nIn 2018 , Algeria had the highest numbers of physicians in the Maghreb region ( 1.72 per 1,000 people \\t) , nurses ( 2.23 per 1,000 people ) , and dentists ( 0.31 per 1,000 people ) . \\nAccess to `` improved water sources '' was around 97.4 % of the population \\tin urban areas and 98.7 % of the population in the rural areas . \\nSome 99 % of Algerians living in urban areas , and around 93.4 % \\tof those living in rural areas , had access to `` improved sanitation '' . \\nAccording to the World Bank , Algeria is making progress toward its goal of `` reducing by half \\tthe number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 '' . \\nGiven Algeria 's young population , policy favours \\tpreventive health care and clinics over hospitals . \\nIn keeping with this policy , \\tthe government maintains an immunisation program . \\nHowever , poor sanitation and unclean water still cause tuberculosis , \\thepatitis , measles , typhoid fever , cholera and dysentery . \\nThe poor generally receive health \\tcare free of charge . \\nHealth records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living \\tin the south to their vital record database in 1905 during French rule . \\nEducation \\t. \\nSince the 1970s , in a centralised system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy , the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for \\tall children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence , now the literacy rate is around 92.6 % . \\nSince 1972 , Arabic is used as the language \\tof instruction during the first nine years of schooling . \\nFrom the third year , French is taught and it \\tis also the language of instruction for science classes . \\nThe students can also learn English \\t, Italian , Spanish and German . \\nIn 2008 , new programs at the elementary appeared , therefore the compulsory schooling does \\tnot start at the age of six anymore , but at the age of five . \\nApart from the 122 private schools , the \\tUniversities of the State are free of charge . \\nAfter nine years of primary school , students can go \\tto the high school or to an educational institution . \\nThe school offers two programs \\t: general or technical . \\nAt the end of the third year of secondary school , students pass the exam of the \\tbaccalaureate , which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes . \\nEducation is officially compulsory for children between \\tthe ages of six and 15 . \\nIn 2008 , the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3 \\t% , 15.6 % for men and 29.0 % for women . \\nThe province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was Algiers Province at 11.6 % \\t, while the province with the highest rate was Djelfa Province at 35.5 % . \\nAlgeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education , which \\tmust accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008 . \\nThe University of Algiers , founded in 1879 , is the oldest , it \\toffers education in various disciplines ( law , medicine , science and letters ) . \\nTwenty-five of these universities and almost all of the institutions of \\thigher education were founded after the independence of the country . \\nEven if some of them offer instruction in Arabic like areas of law and the economy , \\tmost of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English . \\nAmong the most important universities , there are the University of Sciences and Technology \\tHouari Boumediene , the University of Mentouri Constantine , and University of Oran Es-Senia . \\nThe University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd in Tlemcen and University of \\tBatna Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa . \\nAlgeria was ranked 120th in the Global Innovation Index \\tin 2021 , down from 113rd in 2019 . \\nCulture \\t. \\nModern Algerian literature , split between Arabic , Tamazight and French \\t, has been strongly influenced by the country 's recent history . \\nFamous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib , Albert Camus \\t, Kateb Yacine and Ahlam Mosteghanemi while Assia Djebar is widely translated . \\nAmong the important novelists of the 1980s were Rachid Mimouni , later vice-president of Amnesty International \\t, and Tahar Djaout , murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views . \\nMalek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization ; Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste ( \\tmodern-day Souk Ahras ) ; and Ibn Khaldun , though born in Tunis , wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria . \\nThe works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times , and of Emir \\tAbdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times , are widely noted . \\nThe Latin author Apuleius was born in Madaurus ( \\tMdaourouch ) , in what later became Algeria . \\nContemporary Algerian cinema is various in terms of genre \\t, exploring a wider range of themes and issues . \\nThere has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war \\tof independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians . \\nArt \\t. \\nAlgerian painters , like or Baya , attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonisation \\t, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria . \\nIn this line , Mohamed Temam , Abdelkhader Houamel have also returned through this art , scenes from \\tthe history of the country , the habits and customs of the past and the country life . \\nOther new artistic currents including the one of M'hamed Issiakhem , Mohammed Khadda and Bachir Yelles , appeared on the scene of Algerian painting , abandoning figurative \\tclassical painting to find new pictorial ways , in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations . \\nMohammed Khadda and M'hamed Issiakhem have \\tbeen notable in recent years . \\nLiterature \\t. \\nThe historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the Numidian and Roman African era , when \\tApuleius wrote `` The Golden Ass '' , the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety . \\nThis period had also known Augustine of Hippo , \\tNonius Marcellus and Martianus Capella , among many others . \\nThe Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionised the Arab world literature , with authors like Ahmad al-Buni \\t, Ibn Manzur and Ibn Khaldoun , who wrote the Muqaddimah while staying in Algeria , and many others . \\nAlbert Camus was an \\tAlgerian-born French Pied-Noir author . \\nIn 1957 , he was awarded \\tthe Nobel Prize in literature . \\nToday Algeria contains , in its literary landscape , big names having not only marked \\tthe Algerian literature , but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French . \\nAs a first step , Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity , there is the publication of novels \\tas the `` Algerian trilogy '' of Mohammed Dib , or even `` Nedjma '' of Kateb Yacine novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work . \\nOther known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include Mouloud Feraoun , Malek Bennabi , Malek Haddad \\t, Moufdi Zakaria , Abdelhamid Ben Badis , Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa , Mouloud Mammeri , Frantz Fanon , and Assia Djebar . \\nIn the aftermath of the independence , several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene , they will attempt through their works to expose \\ta number of social problems , among them there are Rachid Boudjedra , Rachid Mimouni , Leila Sebbar , Tahar Djaout and Tahir Wattar . \\nCurrently , a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression , due to the terrorism that occurred \\tduring the 1990s , the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure . \\nAmong the most noted recent works , there is the writer , `` the swallows of Kabul '' and `` the attack '' of Yasmina Khadra , `` the oath of \\tbarbarians '' of Boualem Sansal , `` memory of the flesh '' of Ahlam Mosteghanemi and the last novel by Assia Djebar `` nowhere in my father 's House '' . \\nMusic \\t. \\nChaâbi music is a typically Algerian musical genre characterized by specific \\trhythms and of Qacidate ( popular poems ) in Arabic dialect . \\nEl Hadj M'Hamed El Anka is considered the \\tgreatest master of the art in modern times . \\nHe wrote over 350 songs and produced some \\t130 records before his death in 1978 . \\nMany of his pupils went \\ton to be renowned musicians . \\nThe Constantinois Malouf style is saved by musician \\tfrom whom Mohamed Tahar Fergani is a performer . \\nFolk music styles include Bedouin music , characterized by the poetic songs based on long kacida ( poems ) ; Kabyle music , based on \\ta rich repertoire that is poetry and old tales passed through generations ; Shawiya music , a folklore from diverse areas of the Aurès Mountains . \\nRahaba music style is \\tunique to the Aures . \\nSouad Massi is a \\trising Algerian folk singer . \\nOther Algerian singers of the diaspora include Manel \\tFilali in Germany and Kenza Farah in France . \\nTergui music is sung in Tuareg languages \\tgenerally , Tinariwen had a worldwide success . \\nFinally , the staïfi music is born in Sétif \\tand remains a unique style of its kind . \\nModern music is available in several facets , Raï \\tmusic is a style typical of western Algeria . \\nRap , a relatively recent style in \\tAlgeria , is experiencing significant growth . \\nCinema \\t. \\nThe Algerian state 's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million ( EUR 1.3 million ) allocated to production , specific measures and \\tan ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production , renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation . \\nThe financial support provided by the state , through the Fund for the Development of the Arts , Techniques and the Film Industry ( \\tFDATIC ) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence ( AARC ) , plays a key role in the promotion of national production . \\nBetween 2007 and 2013 , FDATIC subsidised 98 films \\t( feature films , documentaries and short films ) . \\nIn mid-2013 , AARC had already supported a total of 78 films \\t, including 42 feature films , 6 short films and 30 documentaries . \\nAccording to the European Audiovisual Observatory 's LUMIERE database , 41 Algerian films were distributed \\tin Europe between 1996 and 2013 ; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions . \\n`` Days of Glory '' ( 2006 ) and `` Outside the Law '' ( 2010 ) \\trecorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union , 3,172,612 and 474,722 , respectively . \\nAlgeria won the Palme d'Or for `` Chronicle of the Years of Fire '' ( 1975 ) , two Oscars for \\t`` Z '' ( 1969 ) , and other awards for the Italian-Algerian movie `` The Battle of Algiers '' . \\nCuisine \\t. \\nAlgerian cuisine is \\trich and diverse . \\nThe country was considered as the \\t`` granary of Rome '' . \\nIt offers a component of dishes and varied dishes , \\tdepending on the region and according to the seasons . \\nThe cuisine uses cereals as the main products , since \\tthey are always produced with abundance in the country . \\nThere is not a dish \\twhere cereals are not present . \\nAlgerian cuisine varies from one region to \\tanother , according to seasonal vegetables . \\nIt can be prepared using \\tmeat , fish and vegetables . \\nAmong the dishes known , couscous , chorba , rechta , chakhchoukha , berkoukes , shakshouka , \\tmthewem , chtitha , mderbel , dolma , brik or bourek , garantita , lham'hlou , etc . \\nMerguez sausage is widely used in Algeria , but it differs \\t, depending on the region and on the added spices . \\nCakes are marketed and can be found in cities \\teither in Algeria , in Europe or North America . \\nHowever , traditional cakes are also made at home \\t, following the habits and customs of each family . \\nAmong these cakes , there are Tamina , Baklawa , Chrik , Garn logzelles , Griouech , Kalb el-louz , Makroud \\t, Mbardja , Mchewek , Samsa , Tcharak , Baghrir , Khfaf , Zlabia , Aarayech , Ghroubiya and Mghergchette . \\nAlgerian pastry also contains \\tTunisian or French cakes . \\nMarketed and home-made bread products include varieties such as Kessra or Khmira \\tor Harchaya , chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue . \\nOther traditional meals sold often as street food include mhadjeb or mahjouba \\t, karantika , doubara , chakhchoukha , hassouna , and t'chicha . \\nSports \\t. \\nVarious games have existed \\tin Algeria since antiquity . \\nIn the Aures , people played several games such as \\tEl Kherba or El khergueba ( chess variant ) . \\nPlaying cards , checkers and chess \\tgames are part of Algerian culture . \\nRacing ( fantasia ) and rifle shooting are \\tpart of cultural recreation of the Algerians . \\nThe first Algerian and African gold medalist is Boughera El \\tOuafi in 1928 Olympics of Amsterdam in the Marathon . \\nThe second Algerian Medalist was Alain Mimoun \\tin 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . \\nSeveral men and women were champions in athletics in the 1990s including Noureddine Morceli , \\tHassiba Boulmerka , Nouria Merah-Benida , and Taoufik Makhloufi , all specialized in middle-distance running . \\nFootball is the most \\tpopular sport in Algeria . \\nSeveral names are engraved in the history of the sport , including Lakhdar Belloumi , Rachid \\tMekhloufi , Hassen Lalmas , Rabah Madjer , Riyad Mahrez , Salah Assad and Djamel Zidane . \\nThe Algeria national football team qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup , 1986 \\tFIFA World Cup , 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup . \\nIn addition , several

'' \\nMajor \\tcharacters . \\nThe following are major \\tcharacters from the novel . \\nProtagonists \\t. \\nDagny \\tTaggart . \\nDagny Taggart is the \\tprotagonist of the novel . \\nShe is vice-president in Charge of Operations for Taggart \\tTranscontinental , under her brother , James Taggart . \\nGiven James ' incompetence , Dagny is responsible \\tfor all the workings of the railroad . \\nFrancisco \\td'Anconia . \\nFrancisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in `` Atlas Shrugged '' \\t, an owner by inheritance of the world 's largest copper mining operation . \\nHe is a childhood friend , and \\tthe first love , of Dagny Taggart . \\nA child prodigy of exceptional talents , Francisco was dubbed the `` climax \\t'' of the d'Anconia line , an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists . \\nHe was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld \\tand student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler . \\nHe began working while still in school , “ proving ” that he could \\thave made a fortune without the aid of his family 's wealth and power . \\nLater , Francisco bankrupts the d'Anconia business to \\tput it out of others ' reach . \\nHis full name is given as `` \\tFrancisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia '' . \\nJohn \\tGalt . \\nJohn Galt is the primary male \\thero of `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nHe initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental , who often dines with Eddie Willers in \\tthe employees ' cafeteria , and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental . \\nOnly Eddie 's side of their \\tconversations is given in the novel . \\nLater in the novel , the reader \\tdiscovers this worker 's true identity . \\nBefore working for Taggart Transcontinental , Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company , where he secretly invented a generator of usable \\telectric energy from ambient static electricity , but abandoned his prototype , and his employment , when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment . \\nThis prototype was found by \\tDagny Taggart and Hank Rearden . \\nGalt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel , working a job and living by \\thimself , where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership . \\nMuch of the book 's third division is given to his \\tbroadcast speech , which presents the author 's philosophy of Objectivism . \\nHenry `` Hank \\t'' Rearden . \\nHenry ( known as `` Hank '' ) Rearden is \\tone of the central characters in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nHe owns the most important steel company in the United States , and invents \\tRearden Metal , an alloy stronger , lighter , cheaper and tougher than steel . \\nHe lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian , \\this brother Philip , and his elderly mother . \\nRearden represents a type of self-made man and eventually divorces Lillian , abandons his steel \\tmills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers , and joins John Galt 's strike . \\nEddie \\tWillers . \\nEdwin `` Eddie '' Willers is the Special Assistant to \\tthe Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental . \\nHis father and grandfather worked for \\tthe Taggarts , and himself likewise . \\nHe is completely loyal to \\tDagny and to Taggart Transcontinental . \\nWillers does not possess the creative ability of Galt 's associates , but matches them \\tin moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations . \\nAfter Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the \\tcaptive Galt , Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse . \\nRagnar \\tDanneskjöld . \\nOne of Galt 's first followers , and world-famous as a pirate , who seizes \\trelief ships sent from the United States to the People 's States of Europe . \\nHe works to ensure that once those espousing Galt 's philosophy are restored to \\ttheir rightful place in society , they have enough capital to rebuild the world . \\nKept in the background for much of the book , Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult \\tsituation , and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years . \\nDanneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow ; their relationship is kept hidden from \\tthe outside world , which only knows of Ludlow as a retired film star . \\nConsidered a misfit by Galt 's other adherents , he views his actions \\tas a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt 's perspective . \\nAccording to Barbara Branden , who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written \\t, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld 's adventures at sea , cut from the final published text . \\nIn a 1974 comment at a lecture , Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld 's name was a tribute \\tto Victor Hugo 's novel , , wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld . \\nIn the published book , Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( Dagny \\tTaggart or Hank Rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter . \\nAntagonists \\t. \\nJames \\tTaggart . \\nThe President of Taggart Transcontinental and \\tthe book 's most important antagonist . \\nTaggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable \\tof making operational decisions on his own . \\nHe relies on his sister , Dagny Taggart , to actually run the railroad , but \\tnonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs . \\nIn a sense , he \\tis the antithesis of Dagny . \\nThis contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life : the desire to overcome those \\ton whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this . \\nIn the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental \\tbreakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect . \\nLillian \\tRearden . \\nThe unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( \\tsecretly at first ) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value . \\nLillian achieves this , when she passes information to James \\tTaggart about her husband 's affair with his sister . \\nThis information is used to blackmail Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate \\twhich delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others . \\nLillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual \\tsatisfaction , until Hank abandons her . \\nDr. Floyd \\tFerris . \\nFerris is a biologist who works as `` \\tco-ordinator '' at the State Science Institute . \\nHe uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and \\tpublishes a book entitled `` Why Do You Think You Think ? '' \\nHe clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden , and \\ttwice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal . \\nHe is also one of the group of looters who tries \\tto get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan . \\nFerris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon , and \\tis the creator of the Ferris Persuader , a torture machine . \\nWhen John Galt is captured by the looters , Ferris uses the device on \\tGalt , but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt . \\nFerris represents the group which uses brute force on \\tthe heroes to achieve the ends of the looters . \\nDr. Robert \\tStadler . \\nA former professor at Patrick Henry University , and along with colleague Hugh \\tAkston , mentor to Francisco d'Anconia , John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld . \\nHe has since become a sell-out , one who had great promise but \\tsquandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free . \\nHe works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use \\tby the military , including a sound-based weapon known as Project X ( Xylophone ) . \\nHe is killed when Cuffy Meigs ( see below ) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X \\t, causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius . \\nThe character was , in part , modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer , whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons. \\t` To his former student Galt , Stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the `` man who knew better '' but chose not to act for the good . \\nWesley \\tMouch . \\nThe incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington , who \\trises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty . \\nIn return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to \\tone , forces Hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources . \\nLater in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator , \\ta position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country . \\nMouch 's mantra , whenever a problem arises from his prior policy \\t, is to say , `` I ca n't help it . \\nI need wider \\tpowers . '' \\nSecondary \\tcharacters . \\nThe following secondary characters also \\tappear in the novel . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 369 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=369 '' title= ''

Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity , concerned with human behavior , human biology , cultures , societies , and linguistics , in both the present and past , including past human species . \\nSocial anthropology studies patterns of behavior , while cultural \\tanthropology studies cultural meaning , including norms and values . \\nA portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology \\tis commonly used today . \\nLinguistic anthropology studies how \\tlanguage influences social life . \\nBiological or physical anthropology studies \\tthe biological development of humans . \\nArchaeological anthropology , often termed as “ anthropology of the past \\t, ” studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence . \\nIt is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia , while in Europe archaeology is viewed \\tas a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines , such as history and palaeontology . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe abstract noun `` anthropology '' is \\tfirst attested in reference to history . \\nIts present use first appeared in Renaissance Germany in \\tthe works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann . \\nTheir New Latin ' derived from the combining forms of the Greek words `` ánthrōpos '' \\t( , `` human '' ) and `` lógos '' ( , `` study '' ) . \\nIts adjectival form appeared in \\tthe works of Aristotle . \\nIt began to be used in English , possibly \\tvia French ' , by the early 18th century . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThrough the \\t19th century . \\nIn 1647 , the Bartholins , early scholars of the University of Copenhagen , defined `` '' as follows : Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to \\tdescribe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the French National Museum of Natural History by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau . \\nVarious short-lived organizations of anthropologists \\thad already been formed . \\nThe Société Ethnologique de Paris , the first to use \\tthe term `` ethnology '' , was formed in 1839 . \\nIts members were \\tprimarily anti-slavery activists . \\nWhen slavery was abolished in France in 1848 \\t, the `` Société '' was abandoned . \\nMeanwhile , the Ethnological Society of New York , currently the American Ethnological Society , was founded on its model in 1842 \\t, as well as the Ethnological Society of London in 1843 , a break-away group of the Aborigines ' Protection Society . \\nThese anthropologists of the times were liberal \\t, anti-slavery , and pro-human-rights activists . \\nThey maintained \\tinternational connections . \\nAnthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results \\tof the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century . \\nTheorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning \\tto suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then . \\nFor them , the publication of Charles Darwin 's `` On the Origin \\tof Species '' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect . \\nDarwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species \\the had seen in agronomy and in the wild . \\nDarwin and Wallace unveiled evolution \\tin the late 1850s . \\nThere was an immediate rush to \\tbring it into the social sciences . \\nPaul Broca in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form the first of \\tthe explicitly anthropological societies , the Société d'Anthropologie de Paris , meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859 . \\nWhen he read Darwin , he became an immediate convert \\tto `` Transformisme '' , as the French called evolutionism . \\nHis definition now became `` the study of the human group , considered as a \\twhole , in its details , and in relation to the rest of nature '' . \\nBroca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon \\t, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech . \\nHe wanted to localize the difference between man and the \\tother animals , which appeared to reside in speech . \\nHe discovered the speech center of the human brain \\t, today called Broca 's area after him . \\nHis interest was mainly in Biological anthropology , but a German philosopher specializing in psychology , Theodor Waitz , took up \\tthe theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work , entitled `` Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker '' , 1859–1864 . \\nThe title was soon translated as `` \\tThe Anthropology of Primitive Peoples '' . \\nThe last two volumes \\twere published posthumously . \\nWaitz defined anthropology as `` the science \\tof the nature of man '' . \\nFollowing Broca 's lead , Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would \\tdiffer from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from `` the animals nearest to him '' . \\nHe stresses that the data of comparison \\tmust be empirical , gathered by experimentation . \\nThe history of civilization , as well as ethnology \\t, are to be brought into the comparison . \\nIt is to be presumed fundamentally that the species , man , is a unity \\t, and that `` the same laws of thought are applicable to all men '' . \\nWaitz was influential \\tamong British ethnologists . \\nIn 1863 , the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London \\tto form the Anthropological Society of London , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology . \\nIt was the 2nd society dedicated \\tto general anthropology in existence . \\nRepresentatives from the French `` Société '' \\twere present , though not Broca . \\nIn his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , `` The \\tAnthropological Review '' , Hunt stressed the work of Waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard . \\nAmong the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor , inventor \\tof cultural anthropology , and his brother Alfred Tylor , a geologist . \\nPreviously Edward had referred to himself as \\tan ethnologist ; subsequently , an anthropologist . \\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed : The Anthropological Society of Madrid ( 1865 ) , the American Anthropological Association in 1902 , the \\tAnthropological Society of Vienna ( 1870 ) , the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology ( 1871 ) , and many others subsequently . \\nThe majority of \\tthese were evolutionists . \\nOne notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology , Ethnology , and Prehistory ( \\t1869 ) founded by Rudolph Virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists . \\nNot religious himself , he insisted that \\tDarwin 's conclusions lacked empirical foundation . \\nDuring the last three decades of the 19th century , a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred \\t, most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association . \\nThe major theorists belonged \\tto these organizations . \\nThey supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula \\tinto the major institutions of higher learning . \\nBy 1898 , 48 educational institutions in \\t13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology . \\nNone of the 75 faculty members \\twere under a department named anthropology . \\n20th and \\t21st centuries . \\nThis meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the \\tmajority of the world 's higher educational institutions , many thousands in number . \\nAnthropology has diversified from a few \\tmajor subdivisions to dozens more . \\nPractical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example \\t, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene . \\nThe organization has reached \\ta global level . \\nFor example , the World Council of Anthropological Associations ( WCAA ) , `` a network of national , regional and international \\tassociations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology '' , currently contains members from about three dozen nations . \\nSince the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , `` social '' anthropology in Great Britain and `` cultural '' anthropology in the US have \\tbeen distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons , long-term in-depth examination of context , and the importance they place on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research . \\nCultural anthropology , in particular , has emphasized cultural relativism , \\tholism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques . \\nThis has been particularly prominent in the United States , from Boas ' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology , through Margaret \\tMead 's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation , to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism . \\nEthnography is one of its primary research designs as well \\tas the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork . \\nIn Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries , the \\tBritish tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate . \\nIn the United States , anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century : `` biological '' \\tor `` physical '' anthropology ; `` social '' , `` cultural '' , or `` sociocultural '' anthropology ; and archaeological anthropology ; plus linguistic anthropology . \\nThese fields frequently overlap but tend \\tto use different methodologies and techniques . \\nEuropean countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology ( a \\tterm coined and defined by Adam F. Kollár in 1783 ) . \\nIt is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts \\tof the world that were influenced by the European tradition . \\nFields \\t. \\nAnthropology is a global discipline involving humanities \\t, social sciences and natural sciences . \\nAnthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of `` Homo sapiens '' , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how \\tthe evolutionary past of `` Homo sapiens '' has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etc . \\nEarly anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand \\tobservable cultural diversity , such as by Al-Biruni of the Islamic Golden Age . \\nAs such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new ( late 20th \\tcentury ) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies . \\nAccording to Clifford Geertz , Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and \\tpostmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies . \\nDuring the 1970s and 1990s , there was an epistemological shift \\taway from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline . \\nDuring this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of \\tknowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology . \\nIn contrast , archaeology and \\tbiological anthropology remained largely positivist . \\nDue to this difference in epistemology , the four sub-fields \\tof anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades . \\nSociocultural \\t. \\nSociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes \\tof cultural anthropology and social anthropology . \\nCultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people `` make sense '' of the \\tworld around them , while social anthropology is the study of the `` relationships '' among individuals and groups . \\nCultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects the experience for self and group , contributing to \\ta more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history . \\nIn that , it helps develop an understanding of social structures , typically of others \\tand other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc . ) . \\nThere is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , \\tand these categories overlap to a considerable degree . \\nInquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt \\tto understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values . \\nAccepting other cultures in their own \\tterms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison . \\nThis project is often accommodated \\tin the field of ethnography . \\nEthnography can refer to both a methodology and \\tthe product of ethnographic research , i.e . \\nan ethnographic \\tmonograph . \\nAs a methodology , ethnography is based upon long-term \\tfieldwork within a community or other research site . \\nParticipant observation is one of the foundational \\tmethods of social and cultural anthropology . \\nEthnology involves the systematic \\tcomparison of different cultures . \\nThe process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an \\temic ( conceptual , vs. etic , or technical ) point of view . \\nThe study of kinship and social organization is a central focus \\tof sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal . \\nSociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , \\tmyth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology ) . \\nComparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural \\tanthropology , including the industrialized ( and de-industrialized ) West . \\nThe Standard Cross-Cultural Sample ( SCCS \\t) includes 186 such cultures . \\nBiological \\t. \\nBiological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the \\tstudy of humans and non-human primates in their biological , evolutionary , and demographic dimensions . \\nIt examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and \\tother primates , and that generate , maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation . \\nArchaeological \\t. \\nArchaeology is the study of the \\thuman past through its material remains . \\nArtifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are \\tevidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies . \\nArchaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce \\tpatterns of past human behavior and cultural practices . \\nEthnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a \\tbetter understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways . \\nLinguistic \\t. \\nLinguistic anthropology ( not to be confused with anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal \\t, variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . \\nIt is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems \\t, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . \\nLinguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , \\tcognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis . \\nEthnography \\t. \\nEthnography is a method of \\tanalysing social or cultural interaction . \\nIt often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also \\tdraw from texts written by participants of in social interactions . \\nEthnography views first-hand experience and \\tsocial context as important . \\nTim Ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human \\texperience , applicable in general and novel settings , while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity . \\nHe argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory \\t, but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another . \\nKey topics by \\tfield : sociocultural . \\nArt , media , music \\t, dance and film . \\nArt \\t. \\nOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art \\tconcerns the universality of 'art ' as a cultural phenomenon . \\nSeveral anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting ' , 'sculpture ' , or 'literature ' , conceived as \\tindependent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non-Western contexts . \\nTo surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects \\twhich , without exclusively being 'artistic ' , have certain evident 'aesthetic ' qualities . \\nBoas ' `` Primitive Art '' , Claude Lévi-Strauss ' `` The Way of the Masks '' ( 1982 ) or Geertz 's 'Art as Cultural \\tSystem ' ( 1983 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics ' . \\nMedia \\t. \\nMedia anthropology ( also known as the anthropology of media or mass media ) emphasizes ethnographic studies as \\ta means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media . \\nThe types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ( e.g. , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists \\tin the field , film production ) to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media . \\nOther types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other \\tareas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education . \\nThis is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press \\t, new media , and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s . \\nMusic \\t. \\nEthnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music ( broadly defined ) , that emphasize its cultural , social , \\tmaterial , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire . \\nEthnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields \\t, such as teaching , politics , cultural anthropology etc . \\nWhile the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries , it \\twas formally introduced as `` ethnomusicology '' by Dutch scholar Jaap Kunst around 1950 . \\nLater , the influence of study in this area spawned the creation \\tof the periodical `` Ethnomusicology '' and the Society of Ethnomusicology . \\nVisual \\t. \\nVisual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production \\tof ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-1990s , new media . \\nWhile the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual \\trepresentation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . \\nVisual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , \\tscrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphs , paintings , and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology . \\nEconomic , political economic \\t, applied and development . \\nEconomic \\t. \\nEconomic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in \\tits widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . \\nIt has a complex relationship with the discipline of \\teconomics , of which it is highly critical . \\nIts origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology , Bronisław Malinowski , and his French \\tcompatriot , Marcel Mauss , on the nature of gift-giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange . \\nEconomic Anthropology remains , for the \\tmost part , focused upon exchange . \\nThe school of thought derived from Marx and known \\tas Political Economy focuses on production , in contrast . \\nEconomic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now \\tturned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective . \\nPolitical \\teconomy . \\nPolitical economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to \\tthe traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non-capitalist societies . \\nPolitical economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to \\tahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture . \\nThree main areas of \\tinterest rapidly developed . \\nThe first of these areas was concerned with the `` pre-capitalist \\t'' societies that were subject to evolutionary `` tribal '' stereotypes . \\nSahlin 's work on hunter-gatherers as the `` original \\taffluent society '' did much to dissipate that image . \\nThe second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world 's population at the time \\t, the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam . \\nThe third area was on colonialism , imperialism \\t, and the creation of the capitalist world-system . \\nMore recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues \\tof industrial ( and post-industrial ) capitalism around the world . \\nApplied \\t. \\nApplied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory \\tof anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems . \\nIt is a `` complex of related , research-based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific \\tcultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and/or the formulation of policy '' . \\nApplied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research ; \\tit includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community . \\nIt is closely related to development anthropology ( distinct \\tfrom the more critical anthropology of development ) . \\nDevelopment \\t. \\nAnthropology of development tends to view development \\tfrom a `` critical '' perspective . \\nThe kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why , \\tif a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing ? \\nWhy is there such a \\tgap between plans and outcomes ? \\nWhy are those working in development so willing to \\tdisregard history and the lessons it might offer ? \\nWhy is development so externally driven \\trather than having an internal basis ? \\nIn short , why does \\tso much planned development fail ? \\nKinship , feminism , \\tgender and sexuality . \\nKinship \\t. \\n`` Kinship '' can refer both to `` the study of '' the patterns of social relationships in one \\tor more human cultures , or it can refer to `` the patterns of social relationships '' themselves . \\nOver its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as `` descent '' , `` \\tdescent groups '' , `` lineages '' , `` affines '' , `` cognates '' , and even `` fictive kinship '' . \\nBroadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent \\t( one 's social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage . \\nWithin kinship you have \\ttwo different families . \\nPeople have their biological families and it \\tis the people they share DNA with . \\nThis is called consanguineal relations \\tor `` blood ties '' . \\nPeople can also have a chosen family in which they chose \\twho they want to be a part of their family . \\nIn some cases people are closer with their \\tchosen family more than with their biological families . \\nFeminist \\t. \\nFeminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ( archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic ) that \\tseeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge . \\nAnthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions , whose perspectives and experiences can \\tdiffer from those of white feminists of Europe , America , and elsewhere . \\nFrom the perspective of the Western world , historically such 'peripheral ' perspectives have been ignored , observed \\tonly from an outsider perspective , and regarded as less-valid or less-important than knowledge from the Western world . \\nExploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial \\tor ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology . \\nFeminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology , along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the `` patriarchal origins of anthropology ( and ( academia ) '' and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology \\twent to males more than 85 % , more than 81 % were under 35 , and only 7.2 % to anyone over 40 years old , thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first-wave feminists until later in life . \\nThis correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory \\t, history , linguistics , archaeology , and anthropology . \\nFeminist anthropologists are often concerned with \\tthe construction of gender across societies . \\nGender constructs are of particular \\tinterest when studying sexism . \\nAccording to St. Clair Drake , Vera Mae Green was , until `` [ w ] \\tell into the 1960s '' , the only African-American female anthropologist who was also a Caribbeanist . \\nShe studied ethnic and family relations in the Caribbean as well as the United States , \\tand thereby tried to improve the way black life , experiences , and culture were studied . \\nHowever , Zora Neale Hurston , although often primarily considered to be a literary author , was trained in anthropology by Franz Boas \\t, and published `` Tell my Horse '' about her `` anthropological observations '' of voodoo in the Caribbean ( 1938 ) . \\nFeminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization , \\twhich is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies . \\nMedical , nutritional , psychological \\t, cognitive and transpersonal . \\nMedical \\t. \\nMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies `` human health \\tand disease , health care systems , and biocultural adaptation '' . \\nIt is believed that William Caudell was the \\tfirst to discover the field of medical anthropology . \\nCurrently , research in medical anthropology is one of the main \\tgrowth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole . \\nIt focuses on the following six basic fields : Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering ( Farmer , 1999 \\t, 2003 ; Beneduce , 2010 ) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness . \\nOn the other hand , there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and \\ttheoretical production , such as `` cultural psychiatry '' and `` transcultural psychiatry '' or `` ethnopsychiatry '' . \\nNutritional \\t. \\nNutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , \\tnutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . \\nIf economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , \\tthen this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization . \\nNutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development \\t( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people . \\nPsychological \\t. \\nPsychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that \\tstudies the interaction of cultural and mental processes . \\nThis subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group – with its own history \\t, language , practices , and conceptual categories – shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health . \\nIt also examines how the understanding of cognition , emotion , motivation , and \\tsimilar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes . \\nCognitive \\t. \\nCognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental \\tpsychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms . \\nCognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that \\timplicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them . \\nTranspersonal \\t. \\nTranspersonal anthropology studies the relationship between \\taltered states of consciousness and culture . \\nAs with transpersonal psychology , the field is much concerned with \\taltered states of consciousness ( ASC ) and transpersonal experience . \\nHowever , the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues – for instance \\t, the roles of myth , ritual , diet , and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences . \\nPolitical and \\tlegal . \\nPolitical \\t. \\nPolitical anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked \\tat from the basis of the structure of societies . \\nPolitical anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started \\tincreasingly to study more `` complex '' social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena . \\nThe turn towards complex societies meant that political \\tthemes were taken up at two main levels . \\nFirstly , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside \\tthe state-regulated sphere ( as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization ) . \\nSecondly , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their \\tinstitutions ( and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions ) . \\nAn anthropology of the state developed , and \\tit is a most thriving field today . \\nGeertz ' comparative work on `` Negara '' , the \\tBalinese state , is an early , famous example . \\nLegal \\t. \\nLegal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in \\t`` the cross-cultural study of social ordering '' . \\nEarlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict \\tmanagement , crime , sanctions , or formal regulation . \\nMore recent applications include issues such as human \\trights , legal pluralism , and political uprisings . \\nPublic \\t. \\nPublic anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky , a professor at Hawaii Pacific University , to `` demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond \\tthe discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad , public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change '' . \\nNature , science \\t, and technology . \\nCyborg \\t. \\nCyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the \\tAmerican Anthropological Association 's annual meeting in 1993 . \\nThe sub-group was very closely related to STS and \\tthe Society for the Social Studies of Science . \\nDonna Haraway 's 1985 `` Cyborg Manifesto '' could be considered the founding document \\tof cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . \\nCyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically \\tmodern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings . \\nDigital \\t. \\nDigital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era \\ttechnology , and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect . \\nIt is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology , \\tand sometimes considered part of material culture . \\nThe field is new , and thus has a \\tvariety of names with a variety of emphases . \\nThese include techno-anthropology , digital ethnography \\t, cyberanthropology , and virtual anthropology . \\nEcological \\t. \\nEcological anthropology is defined as the `` \\tstudy of cultural adaptations to environments '' . \\nThe sub-field is also defined as , `` the study of \\trelationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment '' . \\nThe focus of its research concerns `` how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations \\tadapt to their environments , and how their environments change across space and time . \\nThe contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology , and arguably at least the backdrop , if not \\tthe focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today , is political ecology . \\nMany characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture , politics \\tand power , globalization , localized issues , century anthropology and more . \\nThe focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation \\tof policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land . \\nOften , the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly ( \\torganizing , participation ) or indirectly ( articles , documentaries , books , ethnographies ) . \\nSuch is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker \\tand her relationship with the people of Hyde Park . \\nEnvironment \\t. \\nSocial sciences , like anthropology , can \\tprovide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment . \\nProfessor Kay Milton , Director of the Anthropology research network in the School of History and Anthropology , describes \\tanthropology as distinctive , with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non-industrial indigenous and traditional societies . \\nAnthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture ; not an \\texclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition . \\nMilton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology : dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective , reaction against cartesian dualisms \\twhich obstructs progress in theory ( nature culture divide ) , and finally an increased attention to globalization ( transcending the barriers or time/space ) . \\nEnvironmental discourse appears to be characterized \\tby a high degree of globalization . \\n( The troubling problem is borrowing non-indigenous practices and creating standards \\t, concepts , philosophies and practices in western countries . ) \\nAnthropology and environmental discourse now have become a \\tdistinct position in anthropology as a discipline . \\nKnowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing \\tenvironmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology . \\nHuman activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change , a study commonly found in \\thuman ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed . \\nOther ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts \\t, or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral/universal , etc . \\nIn exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the \\tenvironment should be protected , particularly from the harmful effects of human activities . \\nEnvironmentalism itself can be \\texpressed in many ways . \\nAnthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society , understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships , knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are \\taffected by , dependent and independent variables , `` primitive '' ecological wisdom , diverse environments , resource management , diverse cultural traditions , and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture . \\nHistorical \\t. \\nEthnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures \\tand indigenous customs by examining historical records . \\nIt is also the study of the history of various \\tethnic groups that may or may not exist today . \\nEthnohistory uses both historical and \\tethnographic data as its foundation . \\nIts historical methods and materials go beyond \\tthe standard use of documents and manuscripts . \\nPractitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral \\ttradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names . \\nReligion \\t. \\nThe anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other \\tsocial institutions , and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures . \\nModern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion , and that \\tevery religion is a cultural product , created by the human community that worships it . \\nUrban \\t. \\nUrban anthropology is concerned with issues of \\turbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism . \\nUlf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were \\t`` a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition '' . \\nVarious social processes in the Western World as well as in the `` Third World '' ( the latter being the habitual \\tfocus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of `` specialists in 'other cultures ' '' closer to their homes . \\nThere are two main approaches to urban anthropology : examining the \\ttypes of cities or examining the social issues within the cities . \\nThese two methods are overlapping \\tand dependent of each other . \\nBy defining different types of cities , one would use social factors \\tas well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities . \\nBy directly looking at the different social issues , one would \\talso be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city . \\nKey topics by field \\t: archaeological and biological . \\nAnthrozoology \\t. \\nAnthrozoology ( also known as `` human–animal studies '' \\t) is the study of interaction between living things . \\nIt is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , \\tincluding anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology . \\nA major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects \\tof human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions . \\nIt includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , \\tincluding anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy . \\nBiocultural \\t. \\nBiocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of \\tthe relationships between human biology and culture . \\nPhysical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective \\t; that is , from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences . \\nAfter World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an \\teffort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology . \\nEvolutionary \\t. \\nEvolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology \\tand human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates . \\nEvolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social \\tscience , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors . \\nEvolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and \\tcultural evolution of humans , past and present . \\nIt is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such \\tas archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics . \\nIt is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines \\tof evidence to understand the human experience , past and present . \\nForensic \\t. \\nForensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting \\t, most often in criminal cases where the victim 's remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition . \\nA forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals \\twhose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable . \\nThe adjective `` forensic '' refers to the application of \\tthis subfield of science to a court of law . \\nPalaeoanthropology \\t. \\nPaleoanthropology combines the disciplines of \\tpaleontology and physical anthropology . \\nIt is the study of ancient humans , as found \\tin fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints . \\nGenetics and morphology of specimens are \\tcrucially important to this field . \\nMarkers on specimens , such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth \\t, can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations . \\nOrganizations \\t. \\nContemporary anthropology is an established science with \\tacademic departments at most universities and colleges . \\nThe single largest organization of anthropologists is the American Anthropological \\tAssociation ( AAA ) , which was founded in 1903 . \\nIts members are anthropologists \\tfrom around the globe . \\nIn 1989 , a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association \\tof Social Anthropologists ( EASA ) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe . \\nThe EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of \\tmarginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology . \\nHundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology , sometimes divided up by nation or region , and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines , such \\tas geology , physics , zoology , paleontology , anatomy , music theory , art history , sociology and so on , belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well . \\nEthics \\t. \\nAs the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects \\tof anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves , and professional societies have generated codes of ethics . \\nAnthropologists , like other researchers ( especially historians and scientists engaged in field research \\t) , have over time assisted state policies and projects , especially colonialism . \\nSome commentators have contended \\t: Cultural relativism . \\nAs part of their quest for scientific objectivity , present-day anthropologists typically urge \\tcultural relativism , which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology . \\nThis is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another 's \\tvalues or viewpoints , but be examined dispassionately on their own terms . \\nThere should be no notions , in good anthropology , \\tof one culture being better or worse than another culture . \\nEthical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism \\t, sexism , mutilation ( including circumcision and subincision ) , and torture . \\nTopics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies , \\tto genes , to acculturation , to colonialism , have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences . \\nTo illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such \\tas `` racism '' and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields . \\nMilitary \\tinvolvement . \\nAnthropologists ' involvement with the U.S. government , in \\tparticular , has caused bitter controversy within the discipline . \\nFranz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I , and after the war he published a brief \\texpose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists . \\nBut by the 1940s , many of Boas ' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war \\teffort against the Axis Powers ( Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy , and Imperial Japan ) . \\nMany served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for \\texample , Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information ) . \\nAt the same time , David H. Price 's work on American anthropology during the Cold War \\tprovides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies . \\nAttempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence \\tactivities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little . \\nMany anthropologists ( students and teachers ) \\twere active in the antiwar movement . \\nNumerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly \\tat the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association ( AAA ) . \\nProfessional anthropological bodies often object to the use \\tof anthropology for the benefit of the state . \\nTheir codes of ethics or statements may \\tproscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings . \\nThe Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth \\t( ASA ) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous . \\nThe `` Principles of Professional Responsibility '' issued by the American Anthropological Association and amended through November 1986 stated that `` in relation with their own \\tgovernment and with host governments ... no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given . '' \\nThe current `` Principles of Professional Responsibility '' does \\tnot make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions . \\nAnthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the \\tUS military as part of the US Army 's strategy in Afghanistan . \\n`` The Christian Science Monitor '' reports that `` Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs '' in Afghanistan , under \\tthe `` Human Terrain System '' ( HTS ) program ; in addition , HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq . \\nIn 2009 , the American Anthropological Association 's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , `` When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , \\twhere data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology . \\nIn summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with \\tdisciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of `` anthropology '' within DoD . '' \\nPost-World War \\tII developments . \\nBefore WWII British 'social anthropology ' and American \\t'cultural anthropology ' were still distinct traditions . \\nAfter the war , enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from \\tone another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural ' anthropology . \\nBasic \\ttrends . \\nThere are several characteristics that \\ttend to unite anthropological work . \\nOne of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a \\tcomparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical . \\nThe quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place , problem or phenomenon in detail , \\tusing a variety of methods , over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia . \\nIn the 1990s and 2000s , calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows \\twhere his or her own culture ends and another begins , and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard . \\nThese dynamic relationships , between what can be observed on the ground , as opposed to what can be observed by \\tcompiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology , whether cultural , biological , linguistic or archaeological . \\nBiological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human \\tuniversals ( behaviors , ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures ) . \\nThey use many different methods of study , but modern population genetics , participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists `` into \\tthe field , '' which means traveling to a community in its own setting , to do something called `` fieldwork . '' \\nOn the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples \\t, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs . \\nAlong with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically \\tdivide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . \\nHuman time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material \\t, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . \\nFurther cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or \\tLevalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . \\nAnthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well \\t, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . \\nBy making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , \\tanthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science . \\nCommonalities between \\tfields . \\nBecause anthropology developed from so many different enterprises ( see History of anthropology ) , including but not limited to fossil-hunting , exploring , documentary film-making , paleontology , primatology , antiquity dealings and curatorship , philology , etymology , \\tgenetics , regional analysis , ethnology , history , philosophy , and religious studies , it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article , although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made . \\nSome authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of `` other cultures '' \\t, both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( non-European/non-Western societies ) . \\nFor example , the classic of urban anthropology , Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal `` Exploring the City : Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology '' mentions that the `` Third World '' \\thad habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in `` other cultures '' looked for them far away and started to look `` across the tracks '' only in late 1960s . \\nNow there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics \\tvery close to the author 's `` home '' . \\nIt is also argued that other fields of study , like History \\tand Sociology , on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West . \\nIn France , the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists , but this is increasingly changing , starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like `` Terrain \\t'' ( `` fieldwork '' ) , and developing with the center founded by Marc Augé ( `` Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains '' , the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies ) . \\nSince the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the \\tNorth Atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale . \\nThere has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly \\t, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses . \\nSee \\talso . \\nLists < /doc > < doc id= '' 572 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=572 '' title= '' Agricultural science '' > Agricultural science Agricultural science ( or agriscience for \\tshort ) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture . \\nProfessionals of the agricultural science are \\tcalled agricultural scientists or agriculturists . \\nHistory \\t. \\nIn the 18th century , Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the \\tuse of gypsum ( hydrated calcium sulphate ) as a fertilizer . \\nIn 1843 , John Bennet Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term field \\texperiments at Rothamsted Research in England , some of which are still running as of 2018 . \\nIn the United States , a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the \\tHatch Act of 1887 , which used the term `` agricultural science '' . \\nThe Hatch Act was driven by farmers ' interest \\tin knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer . \\nThe Smith–Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its \\tvocational roots , but the scientific foundation had been built . \\nAfter 1906 , public expenditures on agricultural research in the \\tUS exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years . \\nScope \\t. \\nAgriculture , agricultural science , \\tand agronomy are often confused . \\nHowever , they cover different concepts : \\tSoil forming factors and soil degradation . \\nAgricultural sciences include research and development on : < /doc > < doc id= '' 573 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=573 '' title= '' Alchemy '' > Alchemy Alchemy ( from Arabic : `` al-kīmiyā '' \\t; from Ancient Greek : χυμεία , `` khumeía '' ) is an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in China , India , the Muslim world , and Europe . \\nIn its Western form , alchemy is first attested in a number of \\tpseudepigraphical texts written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries AD . \\nAlchemists attempted to purify , mature \\t, and perfect certain materials . \\nCommon aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of `` base metals '' ( e.g. , lead ) into `` noble metals '' ( \\tparticularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease . \\nThe perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from \\tthe alchemical `` magnum opus '' ( `` Great Work '' ) . \\nThe concept of creating the philosophers ' stone \\twas variously connected with all of these projects . \\nIslamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques , theories \\t, and terms , some of which are still in use today . \\nThey did not abandon the Ancient Greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements , and \\tthey tended to guard their work in secrecy , often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism . \\nIn Europe , the 12th-century translations of medieval Islamic works on science and the \\trediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy . \\nThis late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role \\tin the development of early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine ) . \\nModern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , \\tdespite criticisms by scholars such as Eric J. Holmyard and Marie-Louise von Franz that they should be understood as complementary . \\nThe former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences , who examine the subject in terms of early \\tchemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred . \\nThe latter interests historians of esotericism , \\tpsychologists , and some philosophers and spiritualists . \\nThe subject has also made an ongoing \\timpact on literature and the arts . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe word alchemy comes from old French `` alquemie '' \\t, `` alkimie '' , used in Medieval Latin as . \\nThis name was itself adopted from \\tthe Arabic word ( ) . \\nThe Arabic in turn was a borrowing of the Late Greek term `` khēmeía '' ( ) , also spelled `` khumeia \\t'' ( ) and `` khēmía '' ( ) , with `` al- '' being the Arabic definite article 'the ' . \\nTogether this association can be interpreted as 'the process of transmutation by \\twhich to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form ' . \\nSeveral etymologies have been proposed \\tfor the Greek term . \\nThe first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis ( 3rd–4th centuries ) , who \\tderived it from the name of a book , the `` Khemeu . '' \\nHermanm Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from \\tχύμα , used to describe metallic objects formed by casting . \\nOthers trace its roots to the Egyptian name ' ( hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 ' ) , meaning 'black earth ' , \\twhich refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley , as opposed to red desert sand . \\nAccording to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge , the Arabic word `` ʾ '' actually means `` the Egyptian [ science ] '' , borrowing \\tfrom the Coptic word for `` Egypt '' , ' ( or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic , ' ) . \\nThis Coptic word derives from Demotic ' \\t, itself from ancient Egyptian ' . \\nThe ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour `` black '' ( Egypt was the `` black Land '' , by contrast \\twith the `` red Land '' , the surrounding desert ) ; so this etymology could also explain the nickname `` Egyptian black arts '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nAlchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning \\tsome four millennia and three continents . \\nThese traditions ' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it \\thard to trace their mutual influences and `` genetic '' relationships . \\nOne can distinguish at least three major strands , which appear to be mostly independent , at least in their earlier stages : Chinese alchemy , centered in China ; Indian alchemy , centered \\ton the Indian subcontinent ; and Western alchemy , which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from Greco-Roman Egypt to the Islamic world , and finally medieval Europe . \\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism \\tand Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths . \\nIn contrast , Western alchemy developed its philosophical system \\tmostly independent of but influenced by various Western religions . \\nIt is still an open question whether these three strands share a \\tcommon origin , or to what extent they influenced each other . \\nHellenistic \\tEgypt . \\nThe start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt , where the city of Alexandria \\twas a center of alchemical knowledge , and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods . \\nFollowing the work of André-Jean Festugière , modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire \\tas originating from the Egyptian goldsmith 's art , Greek philosophy and different religious traditions . \\nTracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated \\tby the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus . \\nThe treatises of Zosimos of Panopolis , \\tthe earliest historically attested author ( fl . \\nc. 300 CE ) , can \\thelp in situating the other authors . \\nZosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors , such as Mary the Jewess \\t, Pseudo-Democritus , and Agathodaimon , but very little is known about any of these authors . \\nThe most complete of their works , The `` Four Books '' \\tof Pseudo-Democritus , were probably written in the first century AD . \\nRecent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of Zosimus , who \\ttraced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices . \\nIt has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek \\tphilosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way . \\nZosimos of Panopolis wrote in the `` Final Abstinence '' \\t( also known as the `` Final Count '' ) . \\nZosimos explains that the ancient practice of `` tinctures '' ( the technical Greek name for the alchemical arts ) \\thad been taken over by certain `` demons '' who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices . \\nSince Zosimos also called the demons `` the guardians of places '' ( , ) and those who offered them sacrifices `` \\tpriests '' ( , ) , it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests . \\nWhile critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the Egyptian priests and their followers , \\tZosimos nonetheless saw the tradition 's recent past as rooted in the rites of the Egyptian temples . \\nMythology – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt where it was the \\tdomain of the priestly class , though there is little to no evidence for his assertion . \\nAlchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek , Roman , and \\tEgyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation . \\nThese included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets \\t, Isis , Osiris , Jason , and many others . \\nThe central figure in the mythology of alchemy \\tis Hermes Trismegistus ( or Thrice-Great Hermes ) . \\nHis name is derived from the god \\tThoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes . \\nHermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff , \\twere among alchemy 's principal symbols . \\nAccording to Clement of Alexandria , he wrote what were called the \\t`` forty-two books of Hermes '' , covering all fields of knowledge . \\nThe `` Hermetica '' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for \\tWestern alchemical philosophy and practice , called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners . \\nThese writings were collected in the \\tfirst centuries of the common era . \\nTechnology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated \\twith that of metallurgy , extending back to 3500 BC . \\nMany writings were lost when the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of \\talchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ( AD 292 ) . \\nFew original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived , most notable \\tamong them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X . \\nDating from AD 250–300 , they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones \\t, cleaning and fabricating pearls , and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver . \\nThese writings lack the mystical , philosophical elements of alchemy , but do contain the works of Bolus of \\tMendes ( or Pseudo-Democritus ) , which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements . \\nBetween the time of Bolus and Zosimos , the change \\ttook place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art . \\nPhilosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism , \\tPlatonism , Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy 's character . \\nAn important example of alchemy 's roots in Greek philosophy , originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle , was that \\tall things in the universe were formed from only four elements : earth , air , water , and fire . \\nAccording to Aristotle , each element had a sphere to which \\tit belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed . \\nThe four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter , not quantitative , as our modern elements are ; `` ... \\tTrue alchemy never regarded earth , air , water , and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word . \\nThe four elements are simply the primary , and most general , qualities by means of which \\tthe amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form . '' \\nLater alchemists extensively developed the \\tmystical aspects of this concept . \\nAlchemy coexisted alongside \\temerging Christianity . \\nLactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus \\thad prophesied its birth . \\nSt Augustine later affirmed this in the 4th & amp \\t; 5th centuries , but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry . \\nExamples of Pagan , Christian , and Jewish \\talchemists can be found during this period . \\nMost of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms , \\tsuch as Moses , Isis , Cleopatra , Democritus , and Ostanes . \\nOthers authors such as Komarios , and Chymes \\t, we only know through fragments of text . \\nAfter AD 400 , Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves \\tsolely in commenting on the works of these predecessors . \\nBy the middle of the 7th century \\talchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline . \\nIt was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic \\tworld , facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries . \\nByzantium \\t. \\nGreek alchemy is preserved in medieval Greek ( Byzantine ) manuscripts , and yet historians have only relatively \\trecently begun to pay attention to the study and development of Greek alchemy in the Byzantine period . \\nIndia \\t. \\nThe 2nd millennium BC text Vedas describe \\ta connection between eternal life and gold . \\nA considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third-century CE text called Arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives ( Agniyoga ) and salts extracted from fertile \\tsoils and plant remains ( Yavakshara ) such as saltpetre/nitre , perfume making ( different qualities of perfumes are mentioned ) , granulated ( refined ) Sugar . \\nBuddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries \\tmention the transmutation of base metals to gold . \\nAccording to some scholars Greek alchemy may have influenced Indian alchemy \\tbut there are no hard evidences to back this claim . \\nThe 11th-century Persian chemist and physician Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī , who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni , reported that they The goals \\tof alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body ( Sanskrit `` divya-deham '' ) and immortality while still embodied ( Sanskrit `` jīvan-mukti '' ) . \\nSanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur , that are \\thomologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī . \\nSome early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula \\ttantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath . \\nOther early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise `` Kalyāṇakārakam '' \\tof Ugrāditya , written in South India in the early 9th century . \\nTwo famous early Indian alchemical authors \\twere Nāgārjuna Siddha and Nityanātha Siddha . \\nNāgārjuna Siddha was \\ta Buddhist monk . \\nHis book , `` Rasendramangalam '' , is \\tan example of Indian alchemy and medicine . \\nNityanātha Siddha wrote `` Rasaratnākara '' \\t, also a highly influential work . \\nIn Sanskrit , `` rasa '' translates to `` mercury '' , and Nāgārjuna \\tSiddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold . \\nScholarship on Indian alchemy is in the publication of \\t`` The Alchemical Body '' by David Gordon White . \\nA modern bibliography on Indian alchemical \\tstudies has been written by White . \\nThe contents of 39 Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail \\tin G. Jan Meulenbeld 's `` History of Indian Medical Literature '' . \\nThe discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each \\twork , their special features , and where possible the evidence concerning their dating . \\nChapter 13 of HIML , `` Various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra '' ( or `` Various works on \\talchemy and gems '' ) gives brief details of a further 655 ( six hundred and fifty-five ) treatises . \\nIn some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works ; \\tin other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles . \\nA great deal remains to be \\tdiscovered about Indian alchemical literature . \\nThe content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet ( 2014 \\t) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy . \\nIslamic \\tworld . \\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire , the \\tfocus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World . \\nMuch more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented : indeed , most \\tof the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations . \\nThe word `` alchemy '' itself was derived from \\tthe Arabic word `` al-kīmiyā '' ( الكيمياء ) . \\nThe early Islamic world was \\ta melting pot for alchemy . \\nPlatonic and Aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued \\tto be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship . \\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries , the Arabic works attributed to Jābir ibn Hayyān \\t( Latinized as `` Geber '' or `` Geberus '' ) introduced a new approach to alchemy . \\nPaul Kraus , who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir , put \\tit as follows : Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism . \\nThe most influential author in \\tthis regard was arguably Jabir . \\nJabir 's ultimate goal was `` Takwin '' , the artificial creation of life \\tin the alchemical laboratory , up to , and including , human life . \\nHe analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of `` hotness \\t'' , `` coldness '' , `` dryness '' , and `` moistness '' . \\nAccording to Jabir , in each metal two of \\tthese qualities were interior and two were exterior . \\nFor example , lead was externally cold and \\tdry , while gold was hot and moist . \\nThus , Jabir theorized , by rearranging the qualities \\tof one metal , a different metal would result . \\nBy this reasoning , the search for the \\tphilosopher 's stone was introduced to Western alchemy . \\nJabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance 's name in Arabic \\t, when treated with various transformations , held correspondences to the element 's physical properties . \\nThe elemental system used in medieval \\talchemy also originated with Jabir . \\nHis original system consisted of seven elements , which included the five classical elements ( aether , air , earth , fire , and water ) in addition to two chemical elements \\trepresenting the metals : sulphur , `` the stone which burns '' , which characterized the principle of combustibility , and mercury , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties . \\nShortly thereafter , this evolved into eight elements , with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles \\t: sulphur giving flammability or combustion , mercury giving volatility and stability , and salt giving solidity . \\nThe atomic theory of corpuscularianism , where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer \\tof minute particles or corpuscles , also has its origins in the work of Jabir . \\nFrom the 9th to 14th centuries , alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of \\tpractical Muslim chemists , including Alkindus , Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī , Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun . \\nIn particular , they wrote refutations against \\tthe idea of the transmutation of metals . \\nFrom the 14th century onwards , many materials and practices originally belonging to Indian \\talchemy ( Rasayana ) were assimilated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars . \\nEast \\tAsia . \\nResearchers have found evidence that Chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical \\tphenomena that were shared with Arab alchemists during the medieval period . \\nDiscovered in BC China , the `` magic square of three '' was an propagated to \\tfollowers of Abū Mūsā Jābir ibn Ḥayyān at some point over the proceeding several hundred years . \\nOther commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include \\tdiscrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements . \\nThe silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods , ideas , \\tingredients , religion , and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined . \\nWhereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into \\tnoble metals , Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine . \\nThe philosopher 's stone of European alchemists can be compared \\tto the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists . \\nIn the hermetic view , these two goals were not unconnected , and the philosopher 's stone was often equated \\twith the universal panacea ; therefore , the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears . \\nAs early as 317 AD , Ge Hong documented the use \\tof metals , minerals , and elixirs in early Chinese medicine . \\nHong identified three ancient Chinese documents , titled `` Scripture of Great Clarity , Scripture of the Nine \\tElixirs '' , and `` Scripture of the Golden Liquor , '' as texts containing fundamental alchemical information . \\nHe also described alchemy , along with meditation , as the sole \\tspiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend . \\nIn his work `` Inner Chapters of the Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature '' ( 317 AD ) , \\tHong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide . \\nIn the centuries following Ge Hong 's death , the emphasis placed \\ton alchemy as a spiritual practice among Chinese Daoists was reduced . \\nIn 499 AD , Tao Hongjing refuted Hong 's statement that \\talchemy is as important a spiritual practice as Shangqing meditation . \\nWhile Hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection , he ultimately the found \\tthe `` Scripture of the Nine Elixirs '' to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling , aiming to implement more accessible practicing techniques . \\nIn the early 700s , Neidan ( also known as internal alchemy \\t) was adopted by Daoists as a new form of alchemy . \\nNeidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practicing alchemy with compounds found in \\tthe body , rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early Dao alchemy . \\nFor example , saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner \\tgods and did n't require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce . \\nThe inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person , but rather a \\tcollection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region . \\nAlthough those who practiced Neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies , many of the same elixirs \\tand constituents from previous Daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation . \\nEternal life remained a consideration for Neidan alchemists , as it was believed that one would \\tbecome immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfillment . \\nBlack powder may have been an \\timportant invention of Chinese alchemists . \\nIt is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while \\ttrying to find a potion for eternal life . \\nDescribed in 9th-century texts and used in fireworks in China by \\tthe 10th century , it was used in cannons by 1290 . \\nFrom China , the use of gunpowder spread to Japan \\t, the Mongols , the Muslim world , and Europe . \\nGunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in \\t1241 , and in Europe by the 14th century . \\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of \\ttraditional Chinese medicine , such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion . \\nIn the early Song dynasty , followers of this Taoist idea ( chiefly the elite and upper class \\t) would ingest mercuric sulfide , which , though tolerable in low levels , led many to suicide . \\nThinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens , the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew \\tthis method of alchemy in favor of external sources ( the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan , mastering of the qi , etc . ) \\nChinese alchemy was introduced to the \\tWest by Obed Simon Johnson . \\nMedieval \\tEurope . \\nThe introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144 , with the completion \\tof Robert of Chester 's translation of the Arabic `` Book of the Composition of Alchemy '' . \\nAlthough European craftsmen and technicians pre-existed , Robert notes in his preface that alchemy ( though here still referring to \\tthe elixir rather than to the art itself ) was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing . \\nThe translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo \\t, Spain , through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath . \\nTranslations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum , and \\tthe works of Avicenna and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi . \\nThese brought with them many new words to the European \\tvocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent . \\nAlcohol , carboy , elixir \\t, and athanor are examples . \\nMeanwhile , theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith \\tand experimental rationalism , thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought . \\nThe 11th-century St Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and \\trationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context . \\nIn the early 12th century , Peter Abelard followed Anselm 's work , laying down the \\tfoundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West . \\nIn the early 13th century , Robert Grosseteste used Abelard 's methods of analysis and \\tadded the use of observation , experimentation , and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations . \\nGrosseteste also did much work to \\treconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking . \\nThrough much of the 12th and 13th centuries , alchemical knowledge in Europe \\tremained centered on translations , and new Latin contributions were not made . \\nThe efforts of the translators were \\tsucceeded by that of the encyclopaedists . \\nIn the 13th century , Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were the most notable of \\tthese , their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms . \\nAlbertus Magnus , a Dominican friar , is known to have written works such as the `` Book of Minerals '' where \\the observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time . \\nAlbertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and \\tAvicenna , where they concerned the transmutation of metals . \\nFrom the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century , more than 28 alchemical tracts \\twere misattributed to him , a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist . \\nLikewise , alchemical texts have been attributed \\tto Albert 's student Thomas Aquinas . \\nRoger Bacon , a Franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics , comparative linguistics , and medicine , composed his `` \\tGreat Work '' ( ) for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time . \\nWhile alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic , he did consider \\tit and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy 's connections to soteriology and Christian theology . \\nBacon 's writings integrated morality , salvation , \\talchemy , and the prolongation of life . \\nHis correspondence with Clement highlighted this , noting \\tthe importance of alchemy to the papacy . \\nLike the Greeks before him , Bacon acknowledged the \\tdivision of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres . \\nHe noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle , \\tthe natural philosophers , and all Latin writers of his time . \\nThe practical confirmed the theoretical , and Bacon \\tadvocated its uses in natural science and medicine . \\nIn later European legend , \\the became an archmage . \\nIn particular , along with Albertus Magnus , he was credited with the \\tforging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner 's questions . \\nSoon after Bacon , the influential work of Pseudo-Geber \\t( sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto ) appeared . \\nHis `` Summa Perfectionis '' remained a staple summary of \\talchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods . \\nIt was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury \\ttheory , and the unusual clarity with which they were described . \\nBy the end of the 13th century , alchemy \\thad developed into a fairly structured system of belief . \\nAdepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes , that is to say , they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on \\tthe human body ( for example , if one could learn the secret of purifying gold , one could use the technique to purify the human soul ) . \\nThey believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above , and they had a strong \\ttradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated . \\nFinally , the alchemists practiced their art : they actively experimented with \\tchemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated . \\nTheir entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man 's \\tsoul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam . \\nBy purifying the two parts of man 's \\tsoul , man could be reunited with God . \\nIn the 14th century , alchemy became more accessible to \\tEuropeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars . \\nAlchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to \\tan exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves . \\nDante , Piers Plowman , and Chaucer all painted \\tunflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars . \\nPope John XXII 's 1317 edict , `` Spondent quas non-exhibent \\t'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists . \\nRoman Catholic Inquisitor General Nicholas Eymerich 's `` Directorium Inquisitorum '' , written in 1376 , associated alchemy \\twith the performance of demonic rituals , which Eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture . \\nThis did not , however , lead to any change \\tin the Inquisition 's monitoring or prosecution of alchemists . \\nIn 1403 , Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals ( although it was possible to buy a \\tlicence to attempt to make gold alchemically , and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV ) . \\nThese critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual \\tstudy of alchemy , which continued with an increasingly Christian tone . \\nThe 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus \\t, John of Rupescissa , and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova . \\nNicolas Flamel is a well-known alchemist , but a good example of pseudepigraphy , the \\tpractice of giving your works the name of someone else , usually more famous . \\nAlthough the historical Flamel existed , the writings and \\tlegends assigned to him only appeared in 1612 . \\nFlamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors , and his \\tentire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher 's stone . \\nHis work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions \\t, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations . \\nMost of 'his ' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that \\thad existed before him , especially as regarded the philosopher 's stone . \\nThrough the 14th and 15th centuries , alchemists were much like \\tFlamel : they concentrated on looking for the philosophers ' stone . \\nBernard Trevisan and George \\tRipley made similar contributions . \\nTheir cryptic allusions and symbolism led to \\twide variations in interpretation of the art . \\nRenaissance and early \\tmodern Europe . \\nDuring the Renaissance , Hermetic and Platonic \\tfoundations were restored to European alchemy . \\nThe dawn of medical , pharmaceutical , occult \\t, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed . \\nIn the late 15th century , Marsilio Ficino translated the \\tCorpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin . \\nThese were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had \\ta full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent . \\nRenaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from \\tphysics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel . \\nEsoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism \\t, fusing it with magic , astrology , and Christian cabala . \\nA key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa ( 1486–1535 ) \\t, who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists . \\nIn his `` De Occulta Philosophia '' , he \\tattempted to merge Kabbalah , Hermeticism , and alchemy . \\nHe was instrumental in spreading this new blend \\tof Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy . \\nParacelsus ( Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim , 1493–1541 ) cast alchemy into a \\tnew form , rejecting some of Agrippa 's occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia . \\nParacelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote , `` Many \\thave said of Alchemy , that it is for the making of gold and silver . \\nFor me such is not the aim , but to consider \\tonly what virtue and power may lie in medicines . '' \\nHis hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied \\ton the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm . \\nHe took an approach different from those before him , using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans \\tmust have certain balances of minerals in their bodies , and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them . \\nIatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications \\tof alchemy championed by Paracelsus . \\nJohn Dee ( 13 July 1527 – December \\t, 1608 ) followed Agrippa 's occult tradition . \\nAlthough better known for angel summoning , divination , and his role as astrologer , cryptographer , and consultant to Queen \\tElizabeth I , Dee 's alchemical `` Monas Hieroglyphica '' , written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work . \\nHis writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in \\tline with the Hermetic axiom `` As above so below '' . \\nDuring the 17th century , a short-lived `` supernatural '' interpretation of alchemy became popular \\t, including support by fellows of the Royal Society : Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole . \\nProponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher \\t's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels . \\nEntrepreneurial opportunities were common for \\tthe alchemists of Renaissance Europe . \\nAlchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining , medical \\tservices , and the production of chemicals , medicines , metals , and gemstones . \\nRudolf II , Holy Roman Emperor , in the late 16th century , famously received and \\tsponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague , including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley . \\nKing James IV of Scotland , Julius , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , Henry V , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , Augustus \\t, Elector of Saxony , Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn , and Maurice , Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists . \\nJohn 's son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia \\tand Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book `` Fasciculus Chemicus '' . \\nAlthough most of these appointments were legitimate , the \\ttrend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance . \\n`` Betrüger '' would use sleight of hand , or \\tclaims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage . \\nLegitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath \\twrote about fraudulent transmutations , distinguishing themselves from the con artists . \\nFalse alchemists were sometimes \\tprosecuted for fraud . \\nThe terms `` chemia '' and `` alchemia '' were used as synonyms in the early modern period , and \\tthe differences between alchemy , chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day . \\nThere were important overlaps between practitioners , and trying to \\tclassify them into alchemists , chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic . \\nFor example , Tycho Brahe ( 1546–1601 ) , an alchemist better known for his \\tastronomical and astrological investigations , had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute . \\nMichael Sendivogius ( `` Michał Sędziwój '' , 1566–1636 ) , a Polish alchemist , philosopher , medical doctor and \\tpioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600 . \\nSendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who , \\tin 1621 , applied this in a submarine . \\nIsaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy ( see \\tIsaac Newton 's occult studies ) than he did to either optics or physics . \\nOther early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other \\tstudies include Robert Boyle , and Jan Baptist van Helmont . \\nTheir Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their \\tpractical achievements in medicine and science . \\nLater modern \\tperiod . \\nThe decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with \\tits emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for `` ancient wisdom '' . \\nAlthough the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century , alchemy still flourished \\tfor some two hundred years , and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century . \\nAs late as 1781 James Price claimed to have produced \\ta powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold . \\nEarly modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories , practices , and purposes : `` Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian , \\tParacelsian and anti-Paracelsian , Hermetic , Neoplatonic , mechanistic , vitalistic , and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof . '' \\nRobert Boyle ( 1627–1691 ) pioneered \\tthe scientific method in chemical investigations . \\nHe assumed nothing in his experiments and \\tcompiled every piece of relevant data . \\nBoyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out , the wind characteristics , the position of \\tthe Sun and Moon , and the barometer reading , all just in case they proved to be relevant . \\nThis approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and \\t19th centuries , based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of Lavoisier and John Dalton . \\nBeginning around 1720 , a rigid distinction began to be drawn for \\tthe first time between `` alchemy '' and `` chemistry '' . \\nBy the 1740s , `` alchemy '' was now restricted to the realm of gold making , leading \\tto the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans , and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud . \\nIn order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected , academic writers during the 18th-century scientific \\tEnlightenment attempted , for the sake of survival , to divorce and separate the `` new '' chemistry from the `` old '' practices of alchemy . \\nThis move was mostly successful , and the consequences of \\tthis continued into the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries . \\nDuring the occult revival of the early 19th century \\t, alchemy received new attention as an occult science . \\nThe esoteric or occultist school , which arose during the 19th century , held ( and continues to hold ) the view that the substances and operations \\tmentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense , and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience . \\nThis interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination , as opposed to the physical manipulation of \\tapparatus and chemicals , and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual , moral or mystical processes . \\nIn the 19th-century revival of alchemy , the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne \\tAtwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy . \\nBoth forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy , as Atwood claimed : `` No modern art \\tor chemistry , notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims , has any thing in common with Alchemy . '' \\nAtwood 's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including \\tEliphas Levi , Arthur Edward Waite , and Rudolf Steiner . \\nHitchcock , in his `` Remarks Upon Alchymists '' ( 1855 ) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim \\tthat the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state . \\nIn 1845 , Baron Carl Reichenbach , published his studies on Odic force , a concept with \\tsome similarities to alchemy , but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion . \\nIn 1946 , Louis Cattiaux published the Message Retrouvé , a work \\tthat was at once philosophical , mystical and highly influenced by alchemy . \\nIn his lineage , many researchers , including Emmanuel and Charles \\td'Hooghvorst , are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium . \\nWomen \\t. \\nSeveral women appear in the \\tearliest history of alchemy . \\nMichael Maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers ' stone \\t: Mary the Jewess , Cleopatra the Alchemist , Medera , and Taphnutia . \\nZosimos ' sister Theosebia ( later known as Euthica the Arab ) \\tand Isis the Prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts . \\nThe first alchemist whose name we know \\twas Mary the Jewess ( ) . \\nEarly sources claim that Mary ( or Maria ) devised a number of \\timprovements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry . \\nHer best known advances were \\tin heating and distillation processes . \\nThe laboratory water-bath , known eponymously ( especially in France ) as the bain-marie \\t, is said to have been invented or at least improved by her . \\nEssentially a double-boiler , it was ( and is ) \\tused in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating . \\nThe tribikos ( a modified distillation apparatus ) and the kerotakis ( a more intricate apparatus used especially \\tfor sublimations ) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her . \\nAlthough we have no writing from Mary herself , she \\tis known from the early-fourth-century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis . \\nAfter the Greco-Roman period , women 's \\tnames appear less frequently in alchemical literature . \\nTowards the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Renaissance , due to the emergence \\tof print , women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries . \\nCaterina Sforza , the Countess of Forlì and Lady of Imola , \\tis one of the few confirmed female alchemists after Mary the Jewess . \\nAs she owned an apothecary , she would practice science \\tand conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories . \\nBeing knowledgable in alchemy and pharmacology , she recorded all of \\ther alchemical ventures in a manuscript named ( 'Experiments ' ) . \\nThe manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes \\tcovering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine . \\nOne of these recipes was \\tfor the water of talc . \\nTalc , which makes up talcum powder , is a mineral which , when combined \\twith water and distilled , was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits . \\nThese supposed benefits included turning \\tsilver to gold and rejuvenation . \\nWhen combined with white wine , its powder \\tform could be ingested to counteract poision . \\nFurthermore , if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine , it was \\tsaid to be a source of protection from any poison , sickness , or plague . \\nOther recipes were for making hair \\tdyes , lotions , lip colors . \\nThere was also information on how to treat a variety \\tof ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer . \\nIn addition , there were instructions on producing the quintessence ( or aether ) , an elixir which \\twas believed to be able to heal all sicknesses , defend against diseases , and perpetuate youthfulness . \\nShe also wrote about creating \\tthe illustrious philosophers ' stone . \\nDue to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works , \\tit is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women . \\nAs the sixteenth century went on , scientific culture \\tflourished and people began collecting `` secrets '' . \\nDuring this period `` secrets '' referred to experiments , and the most coveted ones were not \\tthose which were bizarre , but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome . \\nSome women known for their interest in alchemy were Catherine de ' Medici , the Queen of France , and \\tMarie de ' Medici , the following Queen of France , who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory . \\nAlso , Isabella d'Este , the Marchioness of Mantua \\t, made perfumes herself to serve as gifts . \\nIn this period , the only book of secrets ascribed to a \\twoman was ( 'The Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese ' ) . \\nThis book contained information on how to turn base \\tmetals into gold , medicine , and cosmetics . \\nHowever , it is rumored that a man , Girolamo Ruscelli , was \\tthe real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers . \\nThis contributed to a bigger problem in which male authors would credit prominent \\tnoblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience . \\nFor example , in ( `` Gallant Recipe-Book '' ) , the distillation of \\tlemons and roses was attributed to Elisabetta Gonzaga , the duchess of Urbino . \\nIn the same book , Isabella d'Aragona , the daughter of Alfonso \\tII of Naples , is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury . \\nIppolita Maria Sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript \\tabout a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones . \\nMary Anne Atwood 's `` A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery '' \\t( 1850 ) marks the return of women during the nineteenth-century occult revival . \\nModern historical \\tresearch . \\nThe history of alchemy has become a \\tsignificant and recognized subject of academic study . \\nAs the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history , \\tsuch as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , Rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements . \\nInstitutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University , the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism ( EXESESO ) , \\tthe European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism ( ESSWE ) , and the University of Amsterdam 's Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents . \\nA large collection of books on alchemy is \\tkept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam . \\nA recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features \\tstep by step instructions on turning copper into gold . \\nThe author attributed this recipe to \\tan ancient manuscript he located . \\nJournals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include 'Ambix ' , published by the Society for \\tthe History of Alchemy and Chemistry , and 'Isis ' , published by The History of Science Society . \\nCore \\tconcepts . \\nWestern alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of \\tlate antiquity in which it was born . \\nConcepts were imported from Neoplatonism \\tand earlier Greek cosmology . \\nAs such , the classical elements appear in alchemical writings , as \\tdo the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity . \\nSimilarly , the gods of the Roman pantheon who are \\tassociated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature . \\nThe concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are \\tcentral to the theory of the philosopher 's stone . \\nMagnum \\topus . \\nThe Great Work of Alchemy is often described as \\ta series of four stages represented by colors . \\nModernity \\t. \\nDue to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature , and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the \\tarea of chemistry , the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations . \\nThose focusing on the exoteric , such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. \\tNewman , have interpreted the 'decknamen ' ( or code words ) of alchemy as physical substances . \\nThese scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say \\tare described in medieval and early modern texts . \\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum , focusing on the esoteric , scholars , such as Florin George Călian and Anna Marie \\tRoos , who question the reading of Principe and Newman , interpret these same decknamen as spiritual , religious , or psychological concepts . \\nNew interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated , sometimes merging \\tin concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements . \\nGroups like the Rosicrucians and Freemasons have a \\tcontinued interest in alchemy and its symbolism . \\nSince the Victorian revival of alchemy , `` occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice , involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally \\tor not at all the transformation of laboratory substances '' , which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought . \\nEsoteric interpretations of \\thistorical texts . \\nIn the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric \\tand Neo-Hermeticist practitioners , alchemy is fundamentally spiritual . \\nIn this interpretation , transmutation of lead into gold is presented \\tas an analogy for personal transmutation , purification , and perfection . \\nAccording to this view , early alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis ( ) highlighted the \\tspiritual nature of the alchemical quest , symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul . \\nThis approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages , as metaphysical aspects , substances , physical states , and \\tmaterial processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities , spiritual states , and , ultimately , transformation . \\nIn this sense , the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas ' \\twere like a veil , hiding their true spiritual philosophy . \\nIn the Neo-Hermeticist interpretation , both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect , diseased , corruptible , and \\tephemeral state toward a perfect , healthy , incorruptible , and everlasting state , so the philosopher 's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible . \\nApplied to the alchemist , the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment , \\tand the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal . \\nIn texts that are held to have been written according to this view , the cryptic alchemical symbols , diagrams , and textual imagery of late alchemical works are \\tsupposed to contain multiple layers of meanings , allegories , and references to other equally cryptic works ; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning . \\nIn his 1766 `` Alchemical Catechism '' , Théodore Henri de Tschudi \\tdenotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic : Psychology . \\nAlchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and \\tpopularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung . \\nJung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of `` The Secret of the Golden Flower '' , a Chinese alchemical text translated by his friend \\tRichard Wilhelm , he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner , symbolic images coming up in his patients ' dreams , visions , or fantasies . \\nHe observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of \\ttransformation , a process that Jung called `` individuation . '' \\nSpecifically , he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or Lapis as \\tsymbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this `` process of individuation . '' \\nTogether with his alchemical `` mystica soror '' ( mystical sister ) Jungian Swiss analyst Marie-Louise von Franz , Jung \\tbegan collecting old alchemical texts , compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references , and pored over them . \\nThe volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy 's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as \\ta human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer , spirit and matter are reunited in the `` hieros gamos '' , or divine marriage . \\nHis writings are influential in general psychology , but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the \\timportance of dreams , symbols , and the unconscious archetypal forces ( archetypes ) that comprise all psychic life . \\nBoth von Franz and Jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work \\tof alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture . \\nAmong the volumes Jung wrote on alchemy , his magnum opus is \\tVolume 14 of his Collected Works , `` Mysterium Coniunctionis '' . \\nLiterature \\t. \\nAlchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art , \\tseen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment . \\n`` Literary alchemy '' appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to \\tJ. K. Rowling , and also the popular Japanese manga `` Fullmetal Alchemist '' . \\nHere , characters or plot structure \\tfollow an alchemical magnum opus . \\nIn the 14th century , Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still \\tbe seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir Terry Pratchett . \\nVisual artists had a \\tsimilar relationship with alchemy . \\nWhile some of them used alchemy as a source of satire , others worked \\twith the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work . \\nMusic was also present in the works of \\talchemists and continues to influence popular performers . \\nIn the last hundred years , alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric \\trole in fantasy fiction , film , television , novels , comics and video games . \\nScience \\t. \\nOne goal of alchemy , the transmutation of base substances into gold , is \\tnow known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means . \\nAlthough not financially worthwhile , Gold was synthesized \\tin particle accelerators as early as 1941 . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 579 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=579 ''

title= '' Astronomer '' > Astronomer An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth . \\nThey observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and \\tgalaxies – in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy . \\nExamples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy \\t, the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies . \\nA related but distinct subject is physical cosmology \\t, which studies the Universe as a whole . \\nTypes \\t. \\nAstronomers usually fall under either of two \\tmain types : observational and theoretical . \\nObservational astronomers make direct observations of \\tcelestial objects and analyze the data . \\nIn contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate \\tmodels of things that can not be observed . \\nBecause it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers \\tmust observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die . \\nThey use this data to create models or \\tsimulations to theorize how different celestial objects work . \\nFurther subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include \\tplanetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology . \\nAcademic \\t. \\nHistorically , astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky \\t, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws . \\nToday , that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms \\t`` astronomer '' and `` astrophysicist '' are interchangeable . \\nProfessional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in \\tphysics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities . \\nThey spend the majority of their time working on research , although they quite often have other \\tduties such as teaching , building instruments , or aiding in the operation of an observatory . \\nThe American Astronomical Society , which is the major organization of \\tprofessional astronomers in North America , has approximately 7,000 members . \\nThis number includes scientists from other fields such as physics , geology \\t, and engineering , whose research interests are closely related to astronomy . \\nThe International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 countries who \\tare involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond . \\nContrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night , it is far more common to use a \\tcharge-coupled device ( CCD ) camera to record a long , deep exposure , allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time . \\nBefore CCDs , photographic plates were \\ta common method of observation . \\nModern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes \\tusually just a few weeks per year . \\nAnalysis of observed phenomena , along with making predictions as to the causes \\tof what they observe , takes the majority of observational astronomers ' time . \\nAstronomers who serve as faculty spend much of \\ttheir time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes . \\nMost universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes \\tplanetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field . \\nThose who become astronomers usually have a broad background \\tin maths , sciences and computing in high school . \\nTaking courses that teach how to research , \\twrite , and present papers are also invaluable . \\nIn college/university most astronomers get a \\tPhD in astronomy or physics . \\nAmateur \\tastronomers . \\nWhile there is a relatively low number of professional \\tastronomers , the field is popular among amateurs . \\nMost cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on \\ta regular basis and often host star parties . \\nThe Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world \\t, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations . \\nLike any hobby , most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote \\ta few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research . \\nHowever , amateurs span the range from so-called `` armchair astronomers '' to the very ambitious , who own science-grade \\ttelescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 583 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=583 '' title= '' Ameboid stage '' > Ameboid stage < /doc > < doc id= '' 586 '' url= \\t'' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=586 '' title= '' ASCII '' > ASCII ASCII ( ) , abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange , is a character encoding standard for electronic communication . \\nASCII codes represent text in computers , \\ttelecommunications equipment , and other devices . \\nBecause of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented , ASCII has \\tjust 128 code points , of which only 95 are , which severely limited its scope . \\nAll modern computer systems instead use Unicode , which has millions of code points \\t, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set . \\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) \\tprefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding . \\nASCII is one of \\tthe IEEE milestones . \\nOverview \\t. \\nASCII was developed \\tfrom telegraph code . \\nIts first commercial use was as a seven-bit \\tteleprinter code promoted by Bell data services . \\nWork on the ASCII standard began in May 1961 , with the first meeting of the American Standards \\tAssociation 's ( ASA ) ( now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI ) X3.2 subcommittee . \\nThe first edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent a \\tmajor revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986 . \\nCompared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more \\tconvenient sorting ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters . \\nThe use of ASCII format for \\tNetwork Interchange was described in 1969 . \\nThat document was formally elevated to \\tan Internet Standard in 2015 . \\nOriginally based on the ( modern ) English alphabet , ASCII encodes 128 \\tspecified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above . \\nNinety-five of the encoded characters are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , lowercase letters \\t`` a '' to `` z '' , uppercase letters `` A '' to `` Z '' , and punctuation symbols . \\nIn addition , the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing control codes which originated with Teletype machines ; most of these are now \\tobsolete , although a few are still commonly used , such as the carriage return , line feed , and tab codes . \\nFor example , lowercase `` i '' would be represented in the ASCII encoding by binary \\t1101001 = hexadecimal 69 ( `` i '' is the ninth letter ) = decimal 105 . \\nDespite being an American standard , ASCII does not have \\ta code point for the cent ( ¢ ) . \\nIt also does not support English terms with diacritical marks such as résumé \\tand jalapeño , or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as Beyoncé . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange ( ASCII ) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association ( ASA ) , \\tcalled the X3 committee , by its X3.2 ( later X3L2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittee 's X3.2.4 working group ( now INCITS ) . \\nThe ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute ( USASI \\t) , and ultimately became the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) . \\nWith the other special characters and control codes filled in , ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963 , leaving \\t28 code positions without any assigned meaning , reserved for future standardization , and one unassigned control code . \\nThere was some debate at the time whether there should \\tbe more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet . \\nThe indecision did not last long : during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to `` \\tsticks '' 6 and 7 , and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard . \\nThe X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the \\tchange to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting . \\nLocating the lowercase letters in `` sticks '' 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from \\tthe upper case by a single bit , which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers . \\nThe X3 committee made other changes , including other new characters ( the brace and vertical bar characters ) , renaming some \\tcontrol characters ( SOM became start of header ( SOH ) ) and moving or removing others ( RU was removed ) . \\nASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967 , then USAS \\tX3.4-1968 , ANSI X3.4-1977 , and finally , ANSI X3.4-1986 . \\nRevisions of the ASCII standard : In the X3.15 standard , the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should \\tbe transmitted ( least significant bit first ) , and how it should be recorded on perforated tape . \\nThey proposed a 9-track standard for magnetic tape , \\tand attempted to deal with some punched card formats . \\nDesign \\tconsiderations . \\nBit \\twidth . \\nThe X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based \\ton the earlier teleprinter encoding systems . \\nLike other character encodings , ASCII specifies a correspondence \\tbetween digital bit patterns and character symbols ( i.e . \\ngraphemes and control \\tcharacters ) . \\nThis allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process \\t, store , and communicate character-oriented information such as written language . \\nBefore ASCII was developed , the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters \\t, 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols . \\nTo include all these , and control characters compatible with the Comité \\tConsultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique ( CCITT ) International Telegraph Alphabet No . \\n2 ( ITA2 ) standard of 1924 , FIELDATA ( 1956 ) , and \\tearly EBCDIC ( 1963 ) , more than 64 codes were required for ASCII . \\nITA2 was in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code \\tthat Émile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874 . \\nThe committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ITA2 ) , \\twhich would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code . \\nIn a shifted code , some character codes determine \\tchoices between options for the following character codes . \\nIt allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission , as an \\terror in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable . \\nThe standards committee decided against shifting , and \\tso ASCII required at least a seven-bit code . \\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code , since eight bits ( octets ) \\twould allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal . \\nHowever , it would require all data transmission \\tto send eight bits when seven could suffice . \\nThe committee voted to use a seven-bit code \\tto minimize costs associated with data transmission . \\nSince perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position \\t, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired . \\nEight-bit machines ( with octets as the native data type ) that \\tdid not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 . \\nInternal \\torganization . \\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together \\tand all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification . \\nThe first two so-called `` ASCII sticks '' ( \\t32 positions ) were reserved for control characters . \\nThe `` space '' character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position \\t20hex ; for the same reason , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . \\nThe committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64-character alphabets , and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced \\teasily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes , as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code ( 1963 ) . \\nLowercase letters were therefore \\tnot interleaved with uppercase . \\nTo keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics , the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters \\t, and the letter `` A '' was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard . \\nThe digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining 4 bits correspond \\tto their respective values in binary , making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward . \\nMany of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters ; an important \\tsubtlety is that these were based on `` mechanical '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . \\nMechanical typewriters followed the de facto \\tstandard set by the Remington No . \\n2 ( 1878 ) , the first typewriter with a shift key , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` O \\t'' ( capital letter `` o '' ) and `` l '' ( lowercase letter `` L '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . \\nThus , in ASCII codice_5 were placed in the second stick , \\tpositions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . \\nThe parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however \\t, because the place corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the space character . \\nThis was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining characters , \\twhich corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` 8 '' and `` 9 '' . \\nThis discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards , notably the Teletype Model 33 , \\twhich used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII , differently from traditional mechanical typewriters . \\nElectric typewriters , notably the IBM Selectric ( 1961 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the IBM PC ( 1981 \\t) , especially Model M ( 1984 ) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did . \\nThe codice_7 pair also \\tdates to the No . \\n2 , and the codice_8 pairs were used on \\tsome keyboards ( others , including the No . \\n2 , did not shift codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( full \\tstop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting ) . \\nHowever , ASCII split the codice_11 \\tpair ( dating to No . \\n2 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( \\tvaried conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 . \\nSome then-common typewriter characters were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as diacritics for international use , \\tand codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the simple line characters codice_17 ( in addition to common codice_18 ) . \\nThe `` @ '' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented `` \\tÀ '' in the French variation , so the `` @ '' was placed in position 40hex , right before the letter A . \\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message ( SOM ) , end of address ( EOA \\t) , end of message ( EOM ) , end of transmission ( EOT ) , `` who are you ? '' \\n( WRU ) , \\t`` are you ? '' \\n( RU ) , a reserved device control ( DC0 ) , \\tsynchronous idle ( SYNC ) , and acknowledge ( ACK ) . \\nThese were positioned to maximize the \\tHamming distance between their bit patterns . \\nCharacter \\torder . \\nASCII-code order is also called \\t`` ASCIIbetical '' order . \\nCollation of data is sometimes done in this order rather \\tthan `` standard '' alphabetical order ( collating sequence ) . \\nThe main deviations in ASCII order are : An intermediate \\torder converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values . \\nCharacter \\tgroups . \\nControl \\tcharacters . \\nASCII reserves the first 32 codes ( numbers 0–31 decimal ) for control characters : codes originally intended not to represent printable information , but rather to \\tcontrol devices ( such as printers ) that make use of ASCII , or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape . \\nFor example , character 10 represents the `` line feed '' function ( which causes \\ta printer to advance its paper ) , and character 8 represents `` backspace '' . \\nrefers to control characters that do not include carriage return \\t, line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters . \\nExcept for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting , ASCII does not \\tdefine any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document . \\nOther schemes , such as markup languages , \\taddress page and document layout and formatting . \\nThe original ASCII standard used only short \\tdescriptive phrases for each control character . \\nThe ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal \\tlink than on a data stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the meaning of `` delete '' . \\nProbably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model \\t33 ASR , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option . \\nPaper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the \\t1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape . \\nIn particular , the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ( control-Q , DC1 , also known as XON ) \\t, 19 ( control-S , DC3 , also known as XOFF ) , and 127 ( delete ) became de facto standards . \\nThe Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-G ( code 7 , BEL , meaning audibly alert \\tthe operator ) literally , as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character . \\nBecause the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol ( from ASCII-1963 , which had this character instead of underscore ) , a noncompliant use \\tof code 15 ( control-O , shift in ) interpreted as `` delete previous character '' was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected . \\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-S ( XOFF , an abbreviation for transmit off ) \\t, it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control-Q ( XON , transmit on ) caused the tape reader to resume . \\nThis so-called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a `` handshaking '' signal warning a sender to \\tstop transmission because of impending buffer overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique . \\nOn some systems , control-S retains its meaning but control-Q \\tis replaced by a second control-S to resume output . \\nThe 33 ASR also could be configured to employ control-R ( DC2 ) and control-T ( DC4 ) to start and stop the tape punch \\t; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively . \\nDelete vs \\tbackspace . \\nThe Teletype could not move its typehead backwards , so it did not \\thave a key on its keyboard to send a BS ( backspace ) . \\nInstead , there was a key marked \\tthat sent code 127 ( DEL ) . \\nThe purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually-input paper tape : the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to \\tback it up , then type the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored . \\nTeletypes were commonly used with the less-expensive computers from Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) ; these systems had \\tto use what keys were available , and thus the DEL code was assigned to erase the previous character . \\nBecause of this , DEC video terminals ( by default ) sent the DEL code for the key marked `` Backspace '' while the \\tseparate key marked `` Delete '' sent an escape sequence ; many other competing terminals sent a BS code for the backspace key . \\nThe Unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character , this could be set to BS `` or '' DEL , but not both , resulting in recurring situations \\tof ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ( shells that allow line editing , such as ksh , bash , and zsh , understand both ) . \\nThe assumption that no key sent a BS code allowed control+H to be used for \\tother purposes , such as the `` help '' prefix command in GNU Emacs . \\nEscape \\t. \\nMany more of the control codes have been \\tassigned meanings quite different from their original ones . \\nThe `` escape '' character ( ESC , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to \\tallow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning , an `` escape sequence '' . \\nThis is the same meaning of `` escape '' encountered in URL encodings , \\tC language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . \\nOver time this interpretation has been \\tco-opted and has eventually been changed . \\nIn modern usage , an ESC sent `` to '' the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called `` ANSI escape code '' ( or \\t, more properly , a `` Control Sequence Introducer '' ) from ECMA-48 ( 1972 ) and its successors , beginning with ESC followed by a `` [ `` ( left-bracket ) character . \\nIn contrast , an ESC sent `` from '' the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band \\tcharacter used to terminate an operation or special mode , as in the TECO and vi text editors . \\nIn graphical user interface ( GUI ) and windowing systems , ESC generally causes \\tan application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether . \\nEnd of \\tline . \\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage \\t, created problems when transferring `` plain text '' files between systems . \\nThe best example of this is the \\tnewline problem on various operating systems . \\nTeletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both `` carriage return '' ( which moves the printhead to the \\tbeginning of the line ) and `` line feed '' ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) . \\nThe name `` carriage return '' comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter \\tthe carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary . \\nThe entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the \\tright in order to position the paper for the next line . \\nDEC operating systems ( OS/8 , RT-11 , \\tRSX-11 , RSTS , TOPS-10 , etc . ) \\nused both characters to mark the end of a line so \\tthat the console device ( originally Teletype machines ) would work . \\nBy the time so-called `` glass TTYs '' ( later called CRTs or `` dumb terminals '' ) \\tcame along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it . \\nWhen Gary Kildall created CP/M , he was inspired by some of \\tthe command line interface conventions used in DEC 's RT-11 operating system . \\nUntil the introduction of PC DOS in 1981 , IBM had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC encoding instead of \\tASCII , and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of `` carriage return '' was meaningless . \\nIBM 's PC DOS ( also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft ) inherited the convention by \\tvirtue of being loosely based on CP/M , and Windows in turn inherited it from MS-DOS . \\nRequiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity \\tand ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself . \\nTo simplify matters , plain text data streams , including files , on \\tMultics used line feed ( LF ) alone as a line terminator . \\nUnix and Unix-like systems , and Amiga \\tsystems , adopted this convention from Multics . \\nOn the other hand , the original Macintosh OS , Apple DOS , and ProDOS used carriage return ( CR ) alone as a line terminator ; however \\t, since Apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the Unix-based macOS operating system , they now use line feed ( LF ) as well . \\nThe Radio Shack TRS-80 also used \\ta lone CR to terminate lines . \\nComputers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and TENEX using CR-LF line endings ; machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings \\t; and machines running operating systems such as OS/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used EBCDIC rather than ASCII encoding . \\nThe Telnet protocol defined an ASCII `` Network Virtual Terminal '' ( NVT ) , so that connections between hosts \\twith different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network . \\nTelnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings , and software using \\tother conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT . \\nThe File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol , including use of the Network Virtual \\tTerminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode . \\nThis adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to other network protocols , such as those used \\tfor E-mail and the World Wide Web , on systems not using the NVT 's CR-LF line-ending convention . \\nEnd of \\tfile/stream . \\nThe PDP-6 monitor , and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10 , used control-Z \\t( SUB ) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal . \\nSome operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks \\t, and used control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file . \\nFor these reasons , EOF , or end-of-file , was used colloquially \\tand conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-Z instead of SUBstitute . \\nThe end-of-text code ( ETX ) , also known as control-C , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using Z as the control \\tcode to end a file is analogous to its position at the end of the alphabet , and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid . \\nA historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt \\tand halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard . \\nIn C library and Unix conventions , the null character is used to terminate text strings ; such null-terminated \\tstrings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ , where here Z stands for `` zero '' . \\nControl code \\tchart . \\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment , \\tfor example ISO 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers . \\nPrintable \\tcharacters . \\nCodes 20hex to 7Ehex , known as the printable characters , represent \\tletters , digits , punctuation marks , and a few miscellaneous symbols . \\nThere are 95 printable \\tcharacters in total . \\nCode 20hex , the `` space '' character , denotes the space \\tbetween words , as produced by the space bar of a keyboard . \\nSince the space character is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than a control character \\t) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section . \\nCode 7Fhex corresponds to the non-printable `` delete '' ( DEL ) control character and is \\ttherefore omitted from this chart ; it is covered in the previous section 's chart . \\nEarlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret ( 5Ehex \\t) and the left arrow instead of the underscore ( 5Fhex ) . ] ] \\nUsage \\t. \\nASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for \\tAmerican Telephone & amp ; Telegraph 's TWX ( TeletypeWriter eXchange ) network . \\nTWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2 , which \\twas also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system . \\nBob Bemer introduced features such \\tas the escape sequence . \\nHis British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer , `` so much so \\tthat the code that was to become ASCII was first called the `` Bemer–Ross Code '' in Europe '' . \\nBecause of his extensive work on ASCII , Bemer \\thas been called `` the father of ASCII '' . \\nOn March 11 , 1968 , US President Lyndon B. Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States Federal Government support ASCII , stating : I have also approved recommendations of \\tthe Secretary of Commerce [ Luther H. Hodges ] regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations . \\nAll computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to \\tuse the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used . \\nASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December \\t2007 , when UTF-8 encoding surpassed it ; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII . \\nVariants and \\tderivations . \\nAs computer technology spread throughout the world , different standards bodies and corporations developed many \\tvariations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets . \\nOne could class some of these variations as `` ASCII extensions '' , although some misuse that term \\tto represent all variants , including those that do not preserve ASCII 's character-map in the 7-bit range . \\nFurthermore , the ASCII extensions have \\talso been mislabelled as ASCII . \\n7-bit \\tcodes . \\nFrom early in its development , ASCII was intended to be just \\tone of several national variants of an international character code standard . \\nOther international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 ( 1967 ) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII , with extensions for characters \\toutside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States , such as the symbol for the United Kingdom 's pound sterling ( £ ) ; e.g . \\nwith code \\tpage 1104 . \\nAlmost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII , since ASCII \\tsuited the needs of only the US and a few other countries . \\nFor example , Canada had its \\town version that supported French characters . \\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII \\tto include non-English letters ( e.g . \\né , ñ , ß , Ł \\t) , currency symbols ( e.g . \\n£ , ¥ \\t) , etc . \\nSee also YUSCII \\t( Yugoslavia ) . \\nIt would share most characters in common , but assign other locally \\tuseful characters to several code points reserved for `` national use '' . \\nHowever , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO 's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII 's choices for the national use \\tcharacters to seem to be de facto standards for the world , causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points . \\nISO/IEC 646 , like ASCII , \\tis a 7-bit character set . \\nIt does not make any additional codes available , so \\tthe same code points encoded different characters in different countries . \\nEscape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text , but they were rarely used , so it was often impossible to know \\twhat variant to work with and , therefore , which character a code represented , and in general , text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway . \\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to `` national use '' code points that were used \\tfor accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646 , a German , French , or Swedish , etc . \\nprogrammer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646 , rather than ASCII , had to write , and , thus , read , something such as \\tinstead of C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . \\nMany programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII , \\tso plain-text in Swedish , German etc . \\n( for example , in e-mail or Usenet ) contained `` { , } '' \\tand similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to . \\nFor example , a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get `` N { jag har sm|rg \\t} sar '' as the answer , which should be `` Nä jag har smörgåsar '' meaning `` No I 've got sandwiches '' . \\nIn Japan and Korea , still a variation of ASCII is used , in which the backslash ( 5C hex ) is \\trendered as ¥ ( a Yen sign , in Japan ) or ₩ ( a Won sign , in Korea ) . \\nThis means that , for example , the file path C : \\\\Users\\\\Smith is shown as \\tC : ¥Users¥Smith ( in Japan ) or C : ₩Users₩Smith ( in Korea ) . \\n8-bit \\tcodes . \\nEventually , as 8- , 16- , and 32-bit ( and later 64-bit ) computers began to replace 12- , 18- , and 36-bit computers as the \\tnorm , it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory , providing an opportunity for extended , 8-bit relatives of ASCII . \\nIn most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII , leaving the original character-mapping intact \\t, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) characters . \\nEncodings include ISCII ( India ) \\t, VISCII ( Vietnam ) . \\nAlthough these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII , \\ttrue ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard . \\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and \\toften filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics . \\nKaypro CP/M computers used the `` upper \\t'' 128 characters for the Greek alphabet . \\nThe PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based \\ton ASCII-1963 , instead of the more common ASCII-1967 , such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer . \\nAtari 8-bit computers and Galaksija \\tcomputers also used ASCII variants . \\nThe IBM PC defined code page 437 , which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols \\tsuch as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . \\nOperating systems such as DOS supported these code pages , \\tand manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware . \\nDigital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set ( DEC-MCS ) for use in the popular VT220 \\tterminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . \\nThe Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set , both of these contained \\tboth international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets . \\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard ( derived from the DEC-MCS ) finally provided a standard that most systems \\tcopied ( at least as accurately as they copied ASCII , but with many substitutions ) . \\nA popular further extension designed by Microsoft , Windows-1252 ( often mislabeled as \\tISO-8859-1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing . \\nISO-8859-1 , Windows-1252 , and the original 7-bit ASCII were the \\tmost common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common . \\nISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range , \\tas part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system . \\nUnicode \\t. \\nUnicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set ( UCS ) have a much wider array of characters \\tand their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments . \\nWhile ASCII is limited to 128 characters , Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using natural numbers called `` \\tcode points '' ) and encoding ( to 8- , 16- , or 32-bit binary formats , called UTF-8 , UTF-16 , and UTF-32 , respectively ) . \\nASCII was incorporated into the Unicode ( 1991 ) character set as the first 128 \\tsymbols , so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets . \\nThis allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII , as a UTF-8 file containing \\tonly ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters . \\nEven more importantly , forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with \\tthe highest bit set ( as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1 ) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 589 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=589 '' title= '' Ashmore And Cartier Islands '' > Ashmore And Cartier Islands < /doc > < doc \\tid= ''

to appear as moving images . \\nIn traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand \\ton transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . \\nToday , most animations are made \\twith computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . \\nComputer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation ( which may have the look \\tof traditional animation ) can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth , or faster real-time renderings . \\nOther common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and \\tthree-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets , or clay figures . \\nA cartoon is an animated film , usually a \\tshort film , featuring an exaggerated visual style . \\nThe style takes inspiration from comic strips , often featuring anthropomorphic \\tanimals , superheroes , or the adventures of human protagonists . \\nEspecially with animals that form a \\tnatural predator/prey relationship ( e.g . \\ncats and mice , coyotes and birds ) , the action often centers on violent pratfalls \\tsuch as falls , collisions , and explosions that would be lethal in real life . \\nThe illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and \\tlater to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement , but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain . \\nThe illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally \\tdiffer from each other , with unnoticeable interruptions , is a stroboscopic effect . \\nWhile animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a \\tseparate background , computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment . \\nAnalog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images \\tinclude the phénakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope , and film . \\nTelevision and video are popular electronic animation media \\tthat originally were analog and now operate digitally . \\nFor display on computers , technology such as \\tthe animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . \\nIn addition to short films , feature films , television series , animated GIFs , and other media dedicated to the display \\tof moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces , and visual effects . \\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance \\tmoving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation . \\nThe mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate \\tliving beings has a very long history in automata . \\nElectronic automata were popularized \\tby Disney as animatronics . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe word `` animation '' stems from the Latin `` animātiōn '' , \\tstem of `` animātiō '' , meaning `` a bestowing of life '' . \\nThe primary meaning of the English word is `` liveliness '' and has been \\tin use much longer than the meaning of `` moving image medium '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nBefore \\tcinematography . \\nHundreds of years before the introduction of true animation , people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving \\tfigures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry , automata , shadow play , and the magic lantern . \\nThe multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in European theatres from the late 18th century through the first \\thalf of the 19th century , featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion . \\nIn 1833 , the stroboscopic disc ( better known as the phénakisticope ) introduced the principle of modern animation with \\tsequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures . \\nSeries of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years , but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to \\trepresent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements . \\nThe stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope ( 1866 ) \\t, the flip book ( 1868 ) and the praxinoscope ( 1877 ) . \\nA typical 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were \\tdisplayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually . \\nThe flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end \\t, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds . \\nThe first to create much longer sequences seems to have been Charles-Émile Reynaud , who between \\t1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long `` Pantomimes Lumineuses '' . \\nSilent \\tera . \\nWhen cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades , \\tthe wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment . \\nAnimation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys , with chromolithography film \\tloops ( often traced from live-action footage ) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home . \\nIt would take some more years \\tbefore animation reached movie theaters . \\nAfter earlier experiments by movie pioneers J. Stuart Blackton , Arthur Melbourne-Cooper , Segundo de Chomón , and Edwin S. Porter ( among others ) , Blackton 's `` The Haunted Hotel '' \\t( 1907 ) was the first huge stop motion success , baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail , without signs of any known stage trick . \\nÉmile Cohl 's `` Fantasmagorie '' ( 1908 ) is the oldest known example of a \\tstandard cinematographic film composed entirely of what became known as traditional ( hand-drawn ) animation . \\nOther great artistic and very influential short films were created by Ladislas Starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by Winsor McCay with \\tdetailed drawn animation in films such as `` Little Nemo '' ( 1911 ) and `` Gertie the Dinosaur '' ( 1914 ) . \\nDuring the 1910s , the production of animated `` \\tcartoons '' became an industry in the US . \\nSuccessful producer John Randolph Bray and animator Earl Hurd , patented the cel \\tanimation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century . \\nFelix the Cat , who debuted in 1919 , became the first \\tfully realized animal character in the history of American film animation . \\nAmerican golden \\tage . \\nIn 1928 , `` Steamboat Willie '' , featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse , popularized film \\twith synchronized sound and put Walt Disney 's studio at the forefront of the animation industry . \\nAlthough Disney Animation 's actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very \\tsmall , the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the `` aesthetic norms '' of animation ever since . \\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of \\tthe golden age of American animation that would last until the 1960s . \\nThe United States dominated the world market of \\tanimation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts . \\nSeveral studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers , including Walt Disney Productions ' Goofy ( 1932 ) and Donald Duck ( 1934 ) , Warner Bros. Cartoons ' Looney Tunes characters like Porky Pig ( 1935 ) , Daffy Duck ( 1937 ) , Bugs Bunny ( 1938–1940 ) , Tweety ( 1941–1942 ) , Sylvester the Cat ( 1945 ) , Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner ( 1949 ) , Fleischer Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios \\t' Betty Boop ( 1930 ) , Popeye ( 1933 ) , Superman ( 1941 ) and Casper ( 1945 ) , MGM cartoon studio 's Tom and Jerry ( 1940 ) and Droopy , Walter Lantz Productions/Universal Studio Cartoons ' Woody Woodpecker ( 1940 ) , Terrytoons/20th Century Fox 's Gandy Goose ( 1938 ) , Dinky Duck ( 1939 ) , Mighty Mouse ( 1942 ) and Heckle and Jeckle ( 1946 ) and United Artists ' Pink Panther ( 1963 ) . \\nFeatures before \\tCGI . \\nIn 1917 , Italian-Argentine director Quirino Cristiani made the first feature-length film `` El \\tApóstol '' ( now lost ) , which became a critical and commercial success . \\nIt was followed by Cristiani 's `` Sin dejar rastros '' in 1918 , \\tbut one day after its premiere , the film was confiscated by the government . \\nAfter working on it for three years , Lotte Reiniger released the German feature-length silhouette animation \\t`` Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed '' in 1926 , the oldest extant animated feature . \\nIn 1937 , Walt Disney Studios premiered their first animated feature , `` Snow White \\tand the Seven Dwarfs '' , still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features . \\nThe Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with \\t`` Gulliver 's Travels '' with some success . \\nPartly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War , Disney 's next features `` Pinocchio '' , `` Fantasia '' ( \\tboth 1940 ) and Fleischer Studios ' second animated feature `` Mr. Bug Goes to Town '' ( 1941–1942 ) failed at the box office . \\nFor decades afterward , Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features \\t, until Ralph Bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features . \\nSullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting \\twith `` An American Tail '' in 1986 . \\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney 's features , other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both \\tshort and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles , relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques . \\nRussia 's Soyuzmultfilm animation studio , founded in 1936 , produced 20 films ( \\tincluding shorts ) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018 . \\nChina , Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic , Italy , France , and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films \\t, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production , with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation . \\nTelevision \\t. \\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s , when \\ttelevision sets started to become common in most developed countries . \\nCartoons were mainly programmed for children , on convenient time slots \\t, and especially US youth spent many hours watching Saturday-morning cartoons . \\nMany classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the \\t1950s , the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series . \\nHanna-Barbera Productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series , such as `` The Flintstones '' ( 1960–1966 ) ( the first \\tprime time animated series ) , `` Scooby-Doo '' ( since 1969 ) and Belgian co-production `` The Smurfs '' ( 1981–1989 ) . \\nThe constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity \\tresulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts . \\nQuality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such \\tas `` The Simpsons '' ( since 1989 ) as part of a `` renaissance '' of American animation . \\nWhile US animated series also spawned successes internationally , many other countries produced their \\town child-oriented programming , relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation . \\nJapanese anime TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s , and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios , resulting in hit series such as `` Barbapapa \\t'' ( The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977 ) , `` Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ ( Vicky the Viking ) '' ( Austria/Germany/Japan 1974 ) , and `` The Jungle Book '' ( Italy/Japan 1989 ) . \\nSwitch from cels \\tto computers . \\nComputer animation was gradually \\tdeveloped since the 1940s . \\n3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s , with an \\tearly ( short ) appearance in the sci-fi thriller `` Futureworld '' ( 1976 ) . \\n`` The Rescuers Down Under '' was the first feature \\tfilm to be completely created digitally without a camera . \\nIt was produced in a style that 's very similar to traditional cel animation on the Computer Animation Production \\tSystem ( CAPS ) , developed by The Walt Disney Company in collaboration with Pixar in the late 1980s . \\nThe so-called 3D style , more often associated with computer animation , became the dominant technique following the release \\tof Pixar 's `` Toy Story '' ( 1995 ) , the first computer-animated feature in this style . \\nMost of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated \\tfilms around the 1990s , as it proved cheaper and more profitable . \\nNot only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers , but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted \\tappearance , in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software , while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects . \\nEconomic \\tstatus . \\nIn 2010 , the animation market was estimated \\tto be worth circa US $ 80 billion . \\nBy 2020 , the value had increased \\tto an estimated US $ 270 billion . \\nAnimated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins ( around 52 \\t% ) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013 . \\nAnimation as an art and industry continues \\tto thrive as of the early 2020s . \\nEducation , propaganda \\tand commercials . \\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction , while its total malleability \\talso allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality . \\nIt has therefore been widely used \\tfor other purposes than mere entertainment . \\nDuring World War II , animation \\twas widely exploited for propaganda . \\nMany American studios , including Warner Bros. and Disney , lent their talents \\tand their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values . \\nSome countries , including China , Japan and the United Kingdom \\t, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts . \\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials , both due \\tto its graphic appeal , and the humour it can provide . \\nSome animated characters in commercials have survived for decades , such as \\tSnap , Crackle and Pop in advertisements for Kellogg 's cereals . \\nTex Avery was the producer of the first Raid `` Kills Bugs Dead \\t'' commercials in 1966 , which were very successful for the company . \\nOther media , merchandise \\tand theme parks . \\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series , many cartoon characters would \\talso prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media . \\nAnimation has traditionally been very \\tclosely related to comic books . \\nWhile many comic book characters found their way to the screen ( which is often the case in Japan , \\twhere many manga are adapted into anime ) , original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines . \\nSomewhat similarly , characters and plots for video games ( an interactive \\tanimation medium ) have been derived from films and vice versa . \\nSome of the original content produced for the screen \\tcan be used and marketed in other media . \\nStories and images can easily be adapted into \\tchildren 's books and other printed media . \\nSongs and music have appeared on \\trecords and as streaming media . \\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media \\t, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example . \\nSince first being licensed for a children 's writing tablet in 1929 , their Mickey Mouse mascot \\thas been depicted on an enormous amount of products , as have many other Disney characters . \\nThis may have influenced some pejorative use of Mickey 's name , but licensed Disney products sell well , \\tand the so-called Disneyana has many avid collectors , and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub ( since 1984 ) . \\nDisneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions \\tthat were based on Disney 's cartoon characters . \\nIts enormous success spawned several other \\tDisney theme parks and resorts . \\nDisney 's earnings from the theme parks have relatively \\toften been higher than those from their movies . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nCriticism of animation has been common in \\tmedia and cinema since its inception . \\nWith its popularity , a large amount of \\tcriticism has arisen , especially animated feature-length films . \\nCriticisms regarding cultural representation and psychological effects on children have been raised around the animation industry \\t, which some claim has remained politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture . \\nAwards \\t. \\nAs with any other form of media , animation \\thas instituted awards for excellence in the field . \\nMany are part of general or regional film award programs , like the \\tChina 's Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation ( since 1981 ) . \\nAwards programs dedicated to animation , with many categories , include ASIFA-Hollywood 's Annie \\tAwards , the Emile Awards in Europe and the Anima Mundi awards in Brazil . \\nAcademy \\tAwards . \\nApart from Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film ( since 1932 ) and Best Animated Feature ( since 2002 ) , \\tanimated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories , relatively often for Best Original Song and Best Original Score . \\n`` Beauty and the Beast '' was the first \\tanimated film nominated for Best Picture , in 1991 . \\n`` Up '' ( 2009 ) and `` Toy Story 3 '' ( 2010 ) also received \\tBest Picture nominations , after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten . \\nProduction \\t. \\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than a few seconds \\t) has developed as a form of filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . \\nTraits common to both live-action and animated feature-length \\tfilms are labor intensity and high production costs . \\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase , \\tthe marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films . \\nIt is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film , but every take on an animated \\tfilm must be manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation ) . \\nIt is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating \\ta visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film . \\nThus , animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards \\t, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole . \\nWhile live-action films are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more \\tlatitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , real-time improvisation ) . \\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film 's consistency from \\tstart to finish , even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger . \\nAnimators , like all artists , necessarily have individual styles , but must subordinate their \\tindividuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film . \\nSince the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 people , of \\twhom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated films . \\nIt is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their \\tstyles ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult . \\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists \\tdevelop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins . \\nCharacter designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look \\tlike with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . \\nOn traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further \\thelp the animators see how characters would look from different angles . \\nUnlike live-action films , animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the \\tstoryboard format ; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film . \\nIn the early 1960s , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays ( while also continuing \\tto use story departments ) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s . \\nTechniques \\t. \\nTraditional \\t. \\nTraditional animation ( also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation ) was \\tthe process used for most animated films of the 20th century . \\nThe individual frames of a traditionally animated film are \\tphotographs of drawings , first drawn on paper . \\nTo create the illusion of movement , each \\tdrawing differs slightly from the one before it . \\nThe animators ' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels , which are \\tfilled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings . \\nThe completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted \\tbackground by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film . \\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete \\tby the beginning of the 21st century . \\nToday , animators ' drawings and the backgrounds are either \\tscanned into or drawn directly into a computer system . \\nVarious software programs are used to color the \\tdrawings and simulate camera movement and effects . \\nThe final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media \\t, including traditional 35 mm film and newer media with digital video . \\nThe `` look '' of traditional cel animation is still preserved , and the \\tcharacter animators ' work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years . \\nSome animation producers have used the term `` tradigital '' ( a play on the words `` \\ttraditional '' and `` digital '' ) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology . \\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include `` Pinocchio '' ( United States , 1940 ) , `` Animal Farm '' ( United Kingdom , \\t1954 ) , `` Lucky and Zorba '' ( Italy , 1998 ) , and `` The Illusionist '' ( British-French , 2010 ) . \\nTraditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include `` The Lion King '' ( US , 1994 ) , `` The Prince of Egypt '' ( US , 1998 ) , `` Akira '' ( Japan \\t, 1988 ) , `` Spirited Away '' ( Japan , 2001 ) , `` The Triplets of Belleville '' ( France , 2003 ) , and `` The Secret of Kells '' ( Irish-French-Belgian , 2009 ) . \\nFull \\t. \\nFull animation is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that \\tregularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement , having a smooth animation . \\nFully animated films can be made in a variety of styles , from more realistically animated works like those produced by the Walt Disney studio ( `` The Little Mermaid '' \\t, `` Beauty and the Beast '' , `` Aladdin '' , `` The Lion King '' ) to the more 'cartoon ' styles of the Warner Bros. animation studio . \\nMany of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation , as are non-Disney works , `` The Secret of NIMH '' ( US \\t, 1982 ) , `` The Iron Giant '' ( US , 1999 ) , and `` Nocturna '' ( Spain , 2007 ) . \\nFully animated films are often animated on `` twos '' , sometimes on `` ones '' \\t, which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film . \\nLimited \\t. \\nLimited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and \\tmethods of movement usually a choppy or `` skippy '' movement animation . \\nLimited animation uses fewer drawings per second , \\tthereby limiting the fluidity of the animation . \\nThis is a \\tmore economic technique . \\nPioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America , limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression , as \\tin `` Gerald McBoing-Boing '' ( US , 1951 ) , `` Yellow Submarine '' ( UK , 1968 ) , and certain anime produced in Japan . \\nIts primary use , however , has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television ( the work \\tof Hanna-Barbera , Filmation , and other TV animation studios ) and later the Internet ( web cartoons ) . \\nRotoscoping \\t. \\nRotoscoping is a technique patented by Max Fleischer in 1917 \\twhere animators trace live-action movement , frame by frame . \\nThe source film can be directly copied from actors ' outlines into animated drawings , as in `` The Lord of the Rings '' ( US , 1978 ) , or \\tused in a stylized and expressive manner , as in `` Waking Life '' ( US , 2001 ) and `` A Scanner Darkly '' ( US , 2006 ) . \\nSome other examples are `` Fire and Ice '' ( US , 1983 ) , `` Heavy \\tMetal '' ( 1981 ) , and `` Aku no Hana '' ( Japan , 2013 ) . \\nLive-action \\tblending . \\nLive-action/animation is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live \\taction shots or live-action actors into animated shots . \\nOne of the earlier uses was in Koko the \\tClown when Koko was drawn over live-action footage . \\nWalt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of `` Alice Comedies '' \\t( 1923–1927 ) , in which a live-action girl enters an animated world . \\nOther examples include `` Allegro Non Troppo '' ( Italy , 1976 ) , `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit '' ( US , 1988 ) , `` \\tVolere volare '' ( Italy 1991 ) , `` Space Jam '' ( US , 1996 ) and `` Osmosis Jones '' ( US , 2001 ) . \\nStop \\tmotion . \\nStop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing \\tthem one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement . \\nThere are many different types of stop-motion animation , usually \\tnamed after the medium used to create the animation . \\nComputer software is widely available to create this type of animation ; traditional stop-motion \\tanimation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation . \\nComputer \\t. \\nComputer animation encompasses a variety of techniques , the unifying factor \\tbeing that the animation is created digitally on a computer . \\n2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques \\tusually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact . \\n3D animation can create images that \\tseem real to the viewer . \\n2D \\t. \\n2D animation figures are created or edited on the \\tcomputer using 2D bitmap graphics and 2D vector graphics . \\nThis includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques \\t, interpolated morphing , onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping . \\n2D animation has many applications , including analog computer \\tanimation , Flash animation , and PowerPoint animation . \\nCinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an \\tanimated GIF file of which part is animated . \\nFinal line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation , to give artists and animators \\tmore influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department . \\nSpeaking about using this approach in `` Paperman '' , John Kahrs said that `` Our animators can change things \\t, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the arm . '' \\n3D \\t. \\n3D animation is digitally modeled \\tand manipulated by an animator . \\nThe 3D model maker usually starts by creating a \\t3D polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate . \\nA mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces , \\twhich give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment . \\nSometimes , the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an \\tarmature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices . \\nThis process is called rigging and can be used \\tin conjunction with key frames to create movement . \\nOther techniques can be applied , mathematical functions ( e.g. , gravity , particle simulations \\t) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , fire and water simulations . \\nThese techniques fall under the \\tcategory of 3D dynamics . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 594 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=594 '' title= '' Apollo '' \\t> Apollo Apollo is one of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . \\nThe national divinity of the Greeks , Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery , music and \\tdance , truth and prophecy , healing and diseases , the Sun and light , poetry , and more . \\nOne of the most important and complex of the Greek gods , he is the son \\tof Zeus and Leto , and the twin brother of Artemis , goddess of the hunt . \\nSeen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the `` kouros '' ( ephebe , or a \\tbeardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods . \\nApollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan \\tmythology as `` Apulu '' . \\nAs the patron deity of Delphi ( `` Apollo Pythios '' ) \\t, Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . \\nApollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil \\t; various epithets call him the `` averter of evil '' . \\nMedicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through \\tthe god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius . \\nApollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a \\tgod who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows . \\nThe invention of archery itself is credited \\tto Apollo and his sister Artemis . \\nApollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden \\tbow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows . \\nApollo 's capacity to make youths grow is one of \\tthe best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona . \\nAs a protector of the young ( ) , Apollo \\tis concerned with the health and education of children . \\nHe presided over their \\tpassage into adulthood . \\nLong hair , which was the prerogative of boys , was cut \\tat the coming of age ( ) and dedicated to Apollo . \\nApollo is an important pastoral deity , and \\twas the patron of herdsmen and shepherds . \\nProtection of herds , flocks and crops from diseases \\t, pests and predators were his primary duties . \\nOn the other hand , Apollo also encouraged \\tfounding new towns and establishment of civil constitution . \\nHe is associated with \\tdominion over colonists . \\nHe was the giver of laws , and his \\toracles were consulted before setting laws in a city . \\nAs the god of `` mousike '' , Apollo presides \\tover all music , songs , dance and poetry . \\nHe is the inventor of string-music , and the frequent companion \\tof the Muses , functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations . \\nThe lyre is a \\tcommon attribute of Apollo . \\nIn Hellenistic times , especially during the 5th century BCE , as `` Apollo Helios \\t'' he became identified among Greeks with Helios , the personification of the Sun . \\nIn Latin texts , however , there was no conflation of Apollo \\twith Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE . \\nApollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary \\tand mythological texts until the 5th century CE . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nApollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : , ( ) ; Doric : , ; Arcadocypriot : , ; Aeolic : , ; ) The name `` Apollo '' —unlike the related older name `` Paean '' —is generally not found in the Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) texts , \\talthough there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form `` ] pe-rjo- [ `` ( Linear B : ] - [ ) on the KN E 842 tablet , though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read `` Hyperion '' ( [ u ] -pe-rjo- [ ne ] ) . \\nThe etymology of the \\tname is uncertain . \\nThe spelling ( in Classical Attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era \\t, but the Doric form , ( ) , is more archaic , as it is derived from an earlier . \\nIt probably is a cognate to the Doric month `` Apellaios '' ( ) , and \\tthe offerings ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival ( ) . \\nAccording to some scholars , the words are derived from the Doric word ( ) , which originally meant `` \\twall , '' `` fence for animals '' and later `` assembly within the limits of the square . '' \\nApella ( ) is the name of the popular \\tassembly in Sparta , corresponding to the ( ) . \\nR. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with \\tthe noun and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form * '' Apalyun '' . \\nSeveral instances of popular etymology \\tare attested from ancient authors . \\nThus , the Greeks most often associated Apollo 's name with \\tthe Greek verb ( ) , `` to destroy '' . \\nPlato in `` Cratylus '' connects the name with ( ) , `` redemption '' , with ( `` apolousis '' ) , `` purification '' , and with \\t( ) , `` simple '' , in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name , , and finally with ( ) , `` ever-shooting '' . \\nHesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ( ) , which means `` assembly '' , so that Apollo would be the god of political life \\t, and he also gives the explanation ( ) , `` fold '' , in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds . \\nIn the ancient Macedonian language ( ) means `` stone , '' and some toponyms may be derived from this word \\t: ( Pella , the capital of ancient Macedonia ) and ( `` Pellēnē '' / '' Pellene '' ) . \\nThe Hittite form `` Apaliunas '' ( `` d \\t'' ) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter . \\nThe Hittite testimony reflects an early form `` '' , which \\tmay also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . \\nThe name of the Lydian god `` Qλdãns '' /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization , syncope , and the pre-Lydian sound change * y \\t`` & gt ; '' d. Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric `` Ἀπέλjων '' and Hittite `` Apaliunas '' . \\nA Luwian etymology suggested for `` Apaliunas '' makes Apollo `` The One \\tof Entrapment '' , perhaps in the sense of `` Hunter '' . \\nGreco-Roman \\tepithets . \\nApollo 's chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , \\t`` Phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . \\nIt was very commonly used by both the Greeks and \\tRomans for Apollo 's role as the god of light . \\nLike other Greek deities , he had a number of others applied to him , \\treflecting the variety of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the god . \\nHowever , while Apollo has a great number of appellations in \\tGreek myth , only a few occur in Latin literature . \\nOrigin and \\tbirth . \\nApollo 's birthplace was Mount Cynthus \\ton the island of Delos . \\nPlace of \\tworship . \\nDelphi and Actium were his \\tprimary places of worship . \\nCeltic epithets and \\tcult titles . \\nApollo was worshipped throughout \\tthe Roman Empire . \\nIn the traditionally Celtic lands , he was most \\toften seen as a healing and sun god . \\nHe was often equated with \\tCeltic gods of similar character . \\nOrigins \\t. \\nThe cult centers of Apollo in Greece , Delphi \\tand Delos , date from the 8th century BCE . \\nThe Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to \\tArtemis , Apollo 's twin sister . \\nAt Delphi , Apollo was venerated as \\tthe slayer of the monstrous serpent Python . \\nFor the Greeks , Apollo was the most Greek of all \\tthe gods , and through the centuries he acquired different functions . \\nIn Archaic Greece he was the prophet , the oracular god \\twho in older times was connected with `` healing '' . \\nIn Classical Greece he was the god of light and of music , \\tbut in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil . \\nWalter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship , which he termed \\t`` a Dorian-northwest Greek component , a Cretan-Minoan component , and a Syro-Hittite component . '' \\nHealer and god-protector \\tfrom evil . \\nIn classical times , his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and he was therefore called `` apotropaios '' \\t( , `` averting evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from v. + n. ) . \\nApollo also had many epithets relating \\tto his function as a healer . \\nSome commonly-used examples are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' \\t) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of the plague '' ) . \\nIn later writers , the word , `` paion '' , usually spelled `` Paean '' \\t, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing . \\nApollo in his aspect of `` healer '' has a connection to the primitive \\tgod Paean ( ) , who did not have a cult of his own . \\nPaean serves as the healer of the gods in the `` Iliad \\t'' , and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion . \\nIt is suggested , though unconfirmed , that he is connected to \\tthe Mycenaean figure `` pa-ja-wo-ne '' ( Linear B : ) . \\nPaean was the personification of holy songs sung by `` seer-doctors \\t'' ( ) , which were supposed to cure disease . \\nHomer illustrated Paeon the god and the \\tsong both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph . \\nSuch songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods : to \\tDionysus , to Apollo Helios , to Apollo 's son Asclepius the healer . \\nAbout the 4th century BCE , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was \\teither to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . \\nIt was in this way that Apollo had \\tbecome recognized as the god of music . \\nApollo 's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be \\tsung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won . \\nIn the `` Iliad '' , Apollo is the healer under the gods , but he is also the bringer \\tof disease and death with his arrows , similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra . \\nHe sends a plague ( \\t) to the Achaeans . \\nKnowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent , they purify themselves \\tin a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows , called a hecatomb . \\nDorian \\torigin . \\nThe `` Homeric Hymn to Apollo '' depicts \\tApollo as an intruder from the north . \\nThe connection with the northern-dwelling Dorians and their initiation festival `` apellai '' \\tis reinforced by the month `` Apellaios '' in northwest Greek calendars . \\nThe family-festival was dedicated to \\tApollo ( Doric : ) . \\n`` Apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and Apellon \\tis the `` megistos kouros '' ( the great Kouros ) . \\nHowever it can explain only the Doric type of the name , which is connected \\twith the Ancient Macedonian word `` pella '' ( Pella ) , `` stone '' . \\nStones played an important part in the cult of the god \\t, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ( Omphalos ) . \\nMinoan \\torigin . \\nGeorge Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity \\tPaiawon , worshipped in Crete , to have originated at Delphi . \\nIn the `` Homeric Hymn '' , Apollo appeared as a dolphin and \\tcarried Cretan priests to Delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices . \\n`` Apollo Delphinios '' or `` Delphidios '' was a \\tsea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands . \\nApollo 's sister Artemis , who was the Greek goddess of hunting , is identified \\twith Britomartis ( Diktynna ) , the Minoan `` Mistress of the animals '' . \\nIn her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the `` Master of the animals '' , a bow-wielding god of \\thunting whose name has been lost ; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo . \\nAnatolian \\torigin . \\nA non-Greek origin of Apollo has \\tlong been assumed in scholarship . \\nThe name of Apollo 's mother Leto has Lydian origin , \\tand she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor . \\nThe inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia , which is \\tthe origin of Sibyl , and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated . \\nOmens , symbols , purifications , and \\texorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts . \\nThese rituals were spread into the empire of \\tthe Hittites , and from there into Greece . \\nHomer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans , \\tfighting against the Achaeans , during the Trojan War . \\nHe is pictured as a terrible god , \\tless trusted by the Greeks than other gods . \\nThe god seems to be related to `` Appaliunas '' , a tutelary god of \\tWilusa ( Troy ) in Asia Minor , but the word is not complete . \\nThe stones found in front of the gates \\tof Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo . \\nA western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of `` Artimus '' ( Artemis ) and \\t`` Qλdãns '' , whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms , in surviving Lydian texts '' . '' \\nHowever , recent scholars have cast doubt on \\tthe identification of `` Qλdãns '' with Apollo . \\nThe Greeks gave to him the name `` agyieus '' as the protector god of public \\tplaces and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column . \\nHowever , while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon , all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the \\tseventh day of the month , and the emphasis given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates a Babylonian origin . \\nThe Late Bronze Age ( from 1700 to 1200 BCE ) Hittite and Hurrian \\t`` Aplu '' was a god of plague , invoked during plague years . \\nHere we have an apotropaic situation , where a god \\toriginally bringing the plague was invoked to end it . \\nAplu , meaning `` the son of '' , was a title given to the \\tgod Nergal , who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash . \\nHomer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ( ) who brings death and disease with his arrows , \\tbut who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods . \\nIn `` Iliad '' , his priest prays to `` Apollo Smintheus '' , the \\tmouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats . \\nAll these functions , including the function of the healer-god Paean , who \\tseems to have Mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of Apollo . \\nProto-Indo-European \\t. \\nThe Vedic Rudra has some \\tsimilar functions with Apollo . \\nThe terrible god is called `` the archer '' \\tand the bow is also an attribute of Shiva . \\nRudra could bring diseases with his arrows , but he was able to \\tfree people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god . \\nHowever the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong \\trelation with omens , exorcisms , and with the oracular cult . \\nOracular \\tcult . \\nUnusually among the Olympic deities , Apollo had two cult \\tsites that had widespread influence : Delos and Delphi . \\nIn cult practice , Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo ( the Apollo of Delphi \\t) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . \\nLycia was sacred to the god , \\tfor this Apollo was also called Lycian . \\nApollo 's cult was already fully established when \\twritten sources commenced , about 650 BCE . \\nApollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of \\ttheophoric names such as `` Apollodorus '' or `` Apollonios '' and cities named `` Apollonia '' testify to his popularity . \\nOracular sanctuaries to Apollo were \\testablished in other sites . \\nIn the 2nd and 3rd century CE , those at Didyma and Claros pronounced the so-called `` theological oracles \\t'' , in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest deity . \\n`` In the 3rd century \\t, Apollo fell silent . \\nJulian the Apostate ( 359–361 ) tried to \\trevive the Delphic oracle , but failed . '' \\nOracular \\tshrines . \\nApollo had a famous oracle in Delphi , \\tand other notable ones in Claros and Didyma . \\nHis oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis , where he bore the toponymic epithet `` Abaeus '' \\t( , `` Apollon Abaios '' ) , was important enough to be consulted by Croesus . \\nHis oracular shrines include : Oracles were \\talso given by sons of Apollo . \\nTemples of \\tApollo . \\nMany temples were dedicated to Apollo \\tin Greece and the Greek colonies . \\nThey show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek \\tarchitecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations . \\nSome of the earliest temples , especially in Crete \\t, do not belong to any Greek order . \\nIt seems that the first peripteral \\ttemples were rectangular wooden structures . \\nThe different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved \\tin the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order . \\nThe Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects \\twas a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . \\nThe temples should be canonic , and the \\tarchitects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . \\nFrom the earliest times there were certain rules \\tstrictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings . \\nThe first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof , and when \\tthe dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms . \\nThis probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras , who believed that \\tbehind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics . \\nThe Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem \\tregarding the position of the triglyphs , which could n't be solved without changing the original forms . \\nThe order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order , but the Ionic \\tcapital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple . \\nBoth orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order \\tgradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome . \\nThe most important temples \\tare : Mythology . \\nApollo appears often in the \\tmyths , plays and hymns . \\nAs Zeus ' favorite son , Apollo had direct access to the \\tmind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans . \\nA divinity beyond human comprehension , he appears \\tboth as a beneficial and a wrathful god . \\nBirth \\t. \\nApollo was the son of Zeus , the king of the gods \\t, and Leto , his previous wife or one of his mistresses . \\nGrowing up , Apollo was nursed by the nymphs \\tKorythalia and Aletheia , the personification of truth . \\nWhen Zeus ' wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant , \\tshe banned Leto from giving birth on `` terra firma '' . \\nLeto sought shelter in many lands , \\tonly to be rejected by them . \\nFinally , the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating \\tisland named Delos that had once been Asteria , Leto 's own sister . \\nSince it was neither a mainland nor an island , Leto was readily \\twelcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree . \\nAll the goddesses except Hera were \\tpresent to witness the event . \\nIt is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia , the goddess \\tof childbirth , to prevent Leto from going into labor . \\nThe other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her \\ta necklace of amber 9 yards ( 8.2 m ) long . \\nWhen Apollo was born , clutching a golden sword , everything on \\tDelos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance . \\nSwans circled the island seven times \\tand the nymphs sang in delight . \\nHe was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered \\thim in white garment and fastened golden bands around him . \\nSince Leto was unable to feed him , Themis , the goddess \\tof divine law , fed him with nectar , or ambrosia . \\nUpon tasting the divine food , Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that \\the would be the master of lyre and archery , and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind . \\nZeus , who had calmed Hera by then , \\tcame and adorned his son with a golden headband . \\nApollo 's birth fixed the \\tfloating Delos to the earth . \\nLeto promised that her son would \\tbe always favorable towards the Delians . \\nAccording to some , Apollo secured Delos to \\tthe bottom of the ocean after some time . \\nThis island became sacred to Apollo and was one \\tof the major cult centres of the god . \\nApollo was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of \\tthe month Thargelion—according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition . \\nThe seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and \\tfull moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him . \\nMythographers agree that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo or was born on the \\tisland of Ortygia then helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo . \\nHyperborea \\t. \\nHyperborea , the mystical land of eternal spring \\t, venerated Apollo above all the gods . \\nThe Hyperboreans always sang and danced in \\this honor and hosted Pythian games . \\nThere , a vast forest of beautiful trees \\twas called `` the garden of Apollo '' . \\nApollo spent the winter \\tmonths among the Hyperboreans . \\nHis absence from the world caused coldness and \\tthis was marked as his annual death . \\nNo prophecies were issued \\tduring this time . \\nHe returned to the world during \\tthe beginning of the spring . \\nThe `` Theophania '' festival was held \\tin Delphi to celebrate his return . \\nIt is said that Leto came to Delos \\tfrom Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves . \\nHenceforth , Hyperborea became Apollo 's winter \\thome and wolves became sacred to him . \\nHis intimate connection to wolves is evident from his \\tepithet `` Lyceus '' , meaning `` wolf-like '' . \\nBut Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role \\tas the god who protected flocks from predators . \\nThe Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks \\tof Apollo being worshipped as the sun god . \\nShamanistic elements in Apollo 's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin \\t, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman . \\nShamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the \\tfollowers of Apollo , who hailed from Hyperborea . \\nIn myths , the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius \\tdied became the waters of the river Eridanos , which surrounded Hyperborea . \\nApollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which \\the had used to kill the Cyclopes . \\nHe later gave this \\tarrow to Abaris . \\nChildhood and \\tyouth . \\nAs a child , Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an \\taltar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted . \\nSince he learnt the art of building when young , he later came to be known as Archegetes \\t, `` the founder ( of towns ) '' and god who guided men to build new cities . \\nFrom his father Zeus , Apollo had also \\treceived a golden chariot drawn by swans . \\nIn his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows , he was reared \\tby Thriae , the bee nymphs , who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills . \\nApollo is also said to have invented the lyre , \\tand along with Artemis , the art of archery . \\nHe then taught to the humans \\tthe art of healing and archery . \\nPhoebe , his grandmother , gave the oracular shrine \\tof Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift . \\nThemis inspired him to be the \\toracular voice of Delphi thereon . \\nPython \\t. \\nPython , a chthonic serpent-dragon , was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the Delphic \\tOracle , whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto 's womb . \\nPython was the nurse \\tof the giant Typhon . \\nIn most of the traditions , Apollo was \\tstill a child when he killed Python . \\nPython was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant \\tLeto to death , and had assaulted her . \\nTo avenge the trouble given to his mother , Apollo went in search of Python and killed it \\tin the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from Hephaestus . \\nThe Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during \\tthe battle with the cry `` Hie Paean '' . \\nAfter Apollo was victorious , they also brought him \\tgifts and gave the Corycian cave to him . \\nAccording to Homer , Apollo had encountered and killed the Python \\twhen he was looking for a place to establish his shrine . \\nAccording to another version , when Leto was \\tin Delphi , Python had attacked her . \\nApollo defended his mother \\tand killed Python . \\nEuripides in his `` Iphigenia in Aulis '' gives an account \\tof his fight with Python and the event 's aftermath . \\nA detailed account of Apollo 's conflict with Gaia and Zeus \\t' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given . \\nApollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made \\tinferior to his , a wish that Zeus granted him readily . \\nBecause of this , Athena , who had been practicing divination \\tby throwing pebbles , cast her pebbles away in displeasure . \\nHowever , Apollo had committed a blood \\tmurder and had to be purified . \\nBecause Python was a child of Gaia , Gaia wanted \\tApollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment . \\nZeus did n't agree and instead exiled his son \\tfrom Olympus , and instructed him to get purified . \\nApollo had to serve as \\ta slave for nine years . \\nAfter the servitude was over , as per his father 's order , \\the travelled to the Vale of Tempe to bath in waters of Peneus . \\nThere Zeus himself performed \\tpurificatory rites on Apollo . \\nPurified , Apollo was escorted by his half sister Athena to Delphi \\twhere the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaia . \\nAccording to a variation , Apollo had also \\ttravelled to Crete , where Carmanor purified him . \\nApollo later established the Pythian \\tgames to appropriate Gaia . \\nHenceforth , Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of \\tmurder and , made men aware of their guilt and purified them . \\nSoon after , Zeus instructed Apollo to \\tgo to Delphi and establish his law . \\nBut Apollo , disobeying his father , went to the \\tland of Hyperborea and stayed there for a year . \\nHe returned only after the Delphians sang hymns \\tto him and pleaded him to come back . \\nZeus , pleased with his son 's integrity , gave \\tApollo the seat next to him on his right side . \\nHe also gave to Apollo various gifts , like a golden tripod , a \\tgolden bow and arrows , a golden chariot and the city of Delphi . \\nSoon after his return , Apollo \\tneeded to recruit people to Delphi . \\nSo , when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete \\t, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin . \\nThe crew was awed into submission and followed \\ta course that led the ship to Delphi . \\nThere Apollo revealed himself \\tas a god . \\nInitiating them to his service , he instructed \\tthem to keep righteousness in their hearts . \\nThe Pythia was Apollo 's high priestess and \\this mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies . \\nPythia is arguably the constant favorite \\tof Apollo among the mortals . \\nTityos \\t. \\nHera once again sent another giant \\t, Tityos to rape Leto . \\nThis time Apollo shot him with his arrows \\tand attacked him with his golden sword . \\nAccording to other version , Artemis also aided him in \\tprotecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows . \\nAfter the battle Zeus finally relented his \\taid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus . \\nThere , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area \\tof , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver . \\nAdmetus \\t. \\nAdmetus was the king of Pherae , \\twho was known for his hospitality . \\nWhen Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python , he served \\tas a herdsman under Admetus , who was then young and unmarried . \\nApollo is said to have shared a \\tromantic relationship with Admetus during his stay . \\nAfter completing his years of servitude , Apollo \\twent back to Olympus as a god . \\nBecause Admetus had treated Apollo well , the \\tgod conferred great benefits on him in return . \\nApollo 's mere presence is said to have \\tmade the cattle give birth to twins . \\nApollo helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis , the daughter of King Pelias \\t, by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus ' chariot . \\nHe was present during their \\twedding to give his blessings . \\nWhen Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the \\tdue offerings , Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister . \\nWhen Apollo learnt of Admetus ' untimely death , he convinced \\tor tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time . \\nAccording to another version , or perhaps some years later , when Zeus struck down Apollo 's son Asclepius with a \\tlightning bolt for resurrecting the dead , Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes , who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus . \\nApollo would have been banished to Tartarus for this , but his mother Leto intervened , \\tand reminding Zeus of their old love , pleaded him not to kill their son . \\nZeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year \\tof hard labor once again under Admetus . \\nThe love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored \\ttopic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius . \\nNiobe \\t. \\nThe fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo \\twhile he was still in Leto 's womb . \\nNiobe was the queen of \\tThebes and wife of Amphion . \\nShe displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen \\tchildren ( Niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while Leto had only two . \\nShe further mocked Apollo 's effeminate \\tappearance and Artemis ' manly appearance . \\nLeto , insulted by this , \\ttold her children to punish Niobe . \\nAccordingly , Apollo killed Niobe 's \\tsons , and Artemis her daughters . \\nAccording to some versions of the myth , among the Niobids , Chloris \\tand her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto . \\nAmphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either \\tkilled himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge . \\nA devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia \\tMinor and turned into stone as she wept . \\nHer tears formed \\tthe river Achelous . \\nZeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the \\tNiobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them . \\nWhen Chloris married and had children , Apollo granted her son \\tNestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids . \\nHence , Nestor was able \\tto live for 3 generations . \\nBuilding the walls \\tof Troy . \\nOnce Apollo and Poseidon served under the Trojan \\tking Laomedon in accordance to Zeus ' words . \\nApollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king \\tdisguised as humans in order to check his hubris . \\nApollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of \\tmount Ida , while Poseidon built the walls of Troy . \\nOther versions make both Apollo and \\tPoseidon the builders of the wall . \\nIn Ovid 's account , Apollo completes his \\ttask by playing his tunes on his lyre . \\nIn Pindar 's odes , the gods took \\ta mortal named Aeacus as their assistant . \\nWhen the work was completed , three snakes rushed against the wall , and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built \\tby the gods fell down dead , the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus . \\nApollo immediately prophesied that Troy would fall at the hands \\tof Aeacus 's descendants , the Aeacidae ( i.e . \\nhis son Telamon joined Heracles when he \\tsieged the city during Laomedon 's rule . \\nLater , his great-grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden \\thorse that lead to the downfall of Troy ) . \\nHowever , the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised \\t, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands , and sell them as slaves . \\nAngered by the unpaid labour and the insults , Apollo infected the \\tcity with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster Cetus . \\nTo deliver the city from it , Laomedon had to sacrifice his \\tdaughter Hesione ( who would later be saved by Heracles ) . \\nDuring his stay in Troy , Apollo had a lover named \\tOurea , who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon . \\nTogether they had a son named \\tIleus , whom Apollo loved dearly . \\nTrojan \\tWar . \\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan \\tWar waged by the Greeks against the Trojans . \\nDuring the war , the Greek king Agamemnon captured Chryseis , the \\tdaughter of Apollo 's priest Chryses , and refused to return her . \\nAngered by this , Apollo shot arrows infected \\twith the plague into the Greek encampment . \\nHe demanded that they return the girl , and the Achaeans ( Greeks ) complied , indirectly \\tcausing the `` anger of Achilles '' , which is the theme of the `` Iliad '' . \\nReceiving the aegis from Zeus , Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father \\t's command , causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry . \\nHe pushed the Greeks back and \\tdestroyed many of the soldiers . \\nHe is described as `` the rouser of armies '' because \\the rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart . \\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the \\twar , Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel . \\nHowever , Apollo declined to fight him , saying that he \\twould n't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals . \\nWhen the Greek hero Diomedes injured the Trojan hero Aeneas , Aphrodite \\ttried to rescue him , but Diomedes injured her as well . \\nApollo then enveloped Aeneas in \\ta cloud to protect him . \\nHe repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the \\thero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god . \\nAeneas was then taken to Pergamos , a sacred \\tspot in Troy , where he was healed . \\nAfter the death of Sarpedon , a son of Zeus , Apollo rescued the \\tcorpse from the battlefield as per his father 's wish and cleaned it . \\nHe then gave it to Sleep ( \\tHypnos ) and Death ( Thanatos ) . \\nApollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that \\tday , so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while . \\nThe Trojan hero Hector ( who , according to some , was \\tthe god 's own son by Hecuba ) was favored by Apollo . \\nWhen he got severely injured , Apollo healed him \\tand encouraged him to take up his arms . \\nDuring a duel with Achilles , when Hector was about to lose \\t, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him . \\nWhen the Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the \\tfort of Troy , he was stopped by Apollo . \\nEncouraging Hector to attack Patroclus , Apollo stripped the \\tarmour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons . \\nPatroclus was eventually \\tkilled by Hector . \\nAt last , after Hector 's fated death , Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles ' attempt to mutilate \\tit by creating a magical cloud over the corpse , shielding it from the rays of the sun . \\nApollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son \\tTenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son Troilus in his own temple . \\nNot only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles , he also tricked Achilles by \\tdisguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates . \\nHe foiled Achilles ' attempt to \\tmutilate Hector 's dead body . \\nFinally , Apollo caused Achilles ' death by guiding \\tan arrow shot by Paris into Achilles ' heel . \\nIn some versions , Apollo himself killed \\tAchilles by taking the disguise of Paris . \\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors , including Agenor \\t, Polydamas , Glaucus in the battlefield . \\nThough he greatly favored the Trojans , Apollo was bound to follow \\tthe orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war . \\nHeracles \\t. \\nAfter Heracles ( then named Alcides ) was struck with madness and killed his \\tfamily , he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo . \\nApollo , through the Pythia , commanded him to serve king Eurystheus for \\ttwelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him . \\nOnly then would Alcides be \\tabsolved of his sin . \\nApollo also renamed \\thim as Heracles . \\nTo complete his third task , Heracles had to capture the Ceryneian Hind \\t, a hind sacred to Artemis , and bring back it alive . \\nAfter chasing the hind for one year , the animal eventually got tired \\t, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon , Heracles captured it . \\nWhile he was taking it back , he was confronted by Apollo \\tand Artemis , who were angered at Heracles for this act . \\nHowever , Heracles soothed the goddess \\tand explained his situation to her . \\nAfter much pleading , Artemis permitted him to take \\tthe hind and told him to return it later . \\nAfter he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus , Heracles fell in \\tconflict with Iphytus , a prince of Oechalia , and murdered him . \\nSoon after , he \\tcontracted a terrible disease . \\nHe consulted the oracle of Apollo once again , \\tin hope of ridding himself of the disease . \\nThe Pythia , however , \\tdenied to give any prophesy . \\nIn anger , Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started \\twalking away , intending to start his own oracle . \\nHowever , Apollo did not tolerate this and \\tstopped Heracles ; a duel ensued between them . \\nArtemis rushed to support Apollo \\t, while Athena supported Heracles . \\nSoon , Zeus threw his thunderbolt between \\tthe fighting brothers and separated them . \\nHe reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and \\tasked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles . \\nApollo then ordered the hero to serve under Omphale , queen \\tof Lydia for one year in order to purify himself . \\nPeriphas \\t. \\nPeriphas was an Attican king \\tand a priest of Apollo . \\nHe was noble , \\tjust and rich . \\nHe did all \\this duties justly . \\nBecause of this people were very fond of him and \\tstarted honouring him to the same extent as Zeus . \\nAt one point , they worshipped Periphas in place of \\tZeus and set up shrines and temples for him . \\nThis annoyed Zeus , who decided to \\tannihilate the entire family of Periphas . \\nBut because he was a just king and a good devotee \\t, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas . \\nZeus considered Apollo 's words and \\tagreed to let him live . \\nBut he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and \\tmade the eagle the king of birds . \\nWhen Periphas ' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her \\thusband , Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish . \\nPlato 's concept \\tof soulmates . \\nA long time ago , there were three kinds of human beings : male , descended from \\tthe sun ; female , descended from the earth ; and androgynous , descended from the moon . \\nEach human being was completely round , with four arms and fours legs , two identical \\tfaces on opposite sides of a head with four ears , and all else to match . \\nThey were powerful \\tand unruly . \\nOtis and Ephialtes even dared \\tto scale Mount Olympus . \\nTo check their insolence , Zeus devised a plan to humble \\tthem and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them . \\nHe cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary \\trepairs , giving humans the individual shape they still have now . \\nApollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds , he pulled together their \\tskin at the abdomen , and sewed the skin together at the middle of it . \\nThis is what we \\tcall navel today . \\nHe smoothened the wrinkles \\tand shaped the chest . \\nBut he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and \\taround the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment . \\nNurturer of \\tthe young . \\nApollo `` Kourotrophos '' is the god who nurtures \\tand protects children and the young , especially boys . \\nHe oversees their education and \\ttheir passage into adulthood . \\nEducation is said to have originated \\tfrom Apollo and the Muses . \\nMany myths have him \\ttrain his children . \\nIt was a custom for boys to cut and \\tdedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood . \\nChiron , the abandoned centaur , was fostered by Apollo , \\twho instructed him in medicine , prophecy , archery and more . \\nChiron would later become \\ta great teacher himself . \\nAsclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge \\tpertaining to medicinal arts by his father . \\nHowever , he was later entrusted \\tto Chiron for further education . \\nAnius , Apollo 's son by Rhoeo , was \\tabandoned by his mother soon after his birth . \\nApollo brought him up and \\teducated him in mantic arts . \\nAnius later became the priest of \\tApollo and the king of Delos . \\nIamus was the son \\tof Apollo and Evadne . \\nWhen Evadne went into labour , Apollo \\tsent the Moirai to assist his lover . \\nAfter the child was born , Apollo sent \\tsnakes to feed the child some honey . \\nWhen Iamus reached the age of education , Apollo took him to Olympia and taught \\thim many arts , including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds . \\nIdmon was educated by Apollo \\tto be a seer . \\nEven though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with \\tthe Argonauts , he embraced his destiny and died a brave death . \\nTo commemorate his son 's bravery , Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a \\ttown around the tomb of the hero , and to honor him . \\nApollo adopted Carnus , the abandoned \\tson of Zeus and Europa . \\nHe reared the child with the help of his \\tmother Leto and educated him to be a seer . \\nWhen his son Melaneus reached the age of marriage , Apollo asked the princess Stratonice to \\tbe his son 's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed . \\nApollo saved a shepherd boy ( name unknown ) from death \\tin a large deep cave , by the means of vultures . \\nTo thank him , the shepherd built \\tApollo a temple under the name Vulturius . \\nGod of \\tmusic . \\nImmediately after his birth , Apollo demanded a lyre and \\tinvented the paean , thus becoming the god of music . \\nAs the divine singer , he is the \\tpatron of poets , singers and musicians . \\nThe invention of string music \\tis attributed to him . \\nPlato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music \\t, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses . \\nAccording to Socrates , ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the \\tharmony and makes all things move together , both for the gods and the humans . \\nFor this reason , he was called `` Homopolon '' before \\tthe `` Homo '' was replaced by `` A '' . \\nApollo 's harmonious music delivered people from their pain , and \\thence , like Dionysus , he is also called the liberator . \\nThe swans , which were considered to be the most musical among the \\tbirds , were believed to be the `` singers of Apollo '' . \\nThey are Apollo 's sacred birds and acted \\tas his vehicle during his travel to Hyperborea . \\nAelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to \\tApollo , the swans would join the chant in unison . \\nAmong the Pythagoreans , the study of mathematics and music were \\tconnected to the worship of Apollo , their principal deity . \\nTheir belief was that the music purifies the \\tsoul , just as medicine purifies the body . \\nThey also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the \\tmechanics of the cosmos , evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres . \\nApollo appears as the companion of the Muses , and as Musagetes \\t( `` leader of Muses '' ) he leads them in dance . \\nThey spend their time on Parnassus , \\twhich is one of their sacred places . \\nApollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them \\the became the father of famous musicians like Orpheus and Linus . \\nApollo is often found delighting the immortal gods \\twith his songs and music on the lyre . \\nIn his role as the god of banquets , he was always present to play music in \\tweddings of the gods , like the marriage of Eros and Psyche , Peleus and Thetis . \\nHe is a frequent guest of the Bacchanalia , and many ancient \\tceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs . \\nApollo also participated in musical \\tcontests when challenged by others . \\nHe was the victor in all those contests , but \\the tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris . \\nApollo 's \\tlyre . \\nThe invention of lyre is attributed either \\tto Hermes or to Apollo himself . \\nDistinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise \\tshell , whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre . \\nMyths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo 's cows and \\ttook them to a cave in the woods near Pylos , covering their tracks . \\nIn the cave , he found a tortoise \\tand killed it , then removed the insides . \\nHe used one of the cow 's intestines \\tand the tortoise shell and made his lyre . \\nUpon discovering the theft , Apollo confronted Hermes \\tand asked him to return his cattle . \\nWhen Hermes acted innocent , Apollo \\ttook the matter to Zeus . \\nZeus , having seen the events , sided with \\tApollo , and ordered Hermes to return the cattle . \\nHermes then began to play music \\ton the lyre he had invented . \\nApollo fell in love with the instrument and \\toffered to exchange the cattle for the lyre . \\nHence , Apollo then became \\tthe master of the lyre . \\nAccording to other versions , Apollo had invented the lyre himself , whose strings \\the tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas . \\nHermes ' lyre , therefore \\t, would be a reinvention . \\nContest with \\tPan . \\nOnce Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of \\tApollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest . \\nThe mountain-god Tmolus was \\tchosen to umpire . \\nPan blew on his pipes , and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction \\tto himself and his faithful follower , Midas , who happened to be present . \\nThen , Apollo struck the \\tstrings of his lyre . \\nIt was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory \\tto Apollo , and everyone was pleased with the judgement . \\nOnly Midas dissented and questioned \\tthe justice of the award . \\nApollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any \\tlonger , and caused them to become the ears of a donkey . \\nContest with \\tMarsyas . \\nMarsyas was a satyr who was \\tpunished by Apollo for his hubris . \\nHe had found an aulos on the ground , tossed away \\tafter being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy . \\nAthena had also placed a curse upon the instrument , \\tthat whoever would pick it up would be severely punished . \\nWhen Marsyas played the flute , \\teveryone became frenzied with joy . \\nThis led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo \\t, and he challenged the god to a musical contest . \\nThe contest was judged by the Muses \\t, or the nymphs of Nysa . \\nAthena was also present \\tto witness the contest . \\nMarsyas taunted Apollo for `` wearing his hair long , for having a fair \\tface and smooth body , for his skill in so many arts '' . \\nHe also further said , The Muses \\tand Athena sniggered at this comment . \\nThe contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was \\tthat the victor could `` do whatever he wanted '' to the loser . \\nAccording to one account , after the first round \\t, they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads . \\nBut in the next round , Apollo decided to play on \\this lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance . \\nMarsyas argued against this , saying that Apollo would \\thave an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating . \\nBut Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute , which needed air blown from the throat , it was similar to singing , \\tand that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all . \\nThe nymphs decided that Apollo \\t's argument was just . \\nApollo then played his lyre and sang at \\tthe same time , mesmerising the audience . \\nMarsyas could not \\tdo this . \\nApollo was declared the winner and , angered with Marsyas ' \\thaughtiness and his accusations , decided to flay the satyr . \\nAccording to another account , Marsyas played his flute out \\tof tune at one point and accepted his defeat . \\nOut of shame , he assigned to himself the \\tpunishment of being skinned for a wine sack . \\nAnother variation is that Apollo \\tplayed his instrument upside down . \\nMarsyas could not do \\tthis with his instrument . \\nSo the Muses who were the \\tjudges declared Apollo the winner . \\nApollo hung Marsyas from a \\ttree to flay him . \\nApollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near \\tCelaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . \\nHe then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas \\t' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others . \\nMarsyas ' blood turned \\tinto the river Marsyas . \\nBut Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done \\t, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away . \\nThe lyre was later discovered by the Muses \\tand Apollo 's sons Linus and Orpheus . \\nThe Muses fixed the middle string , Linus the string struck with the \\tforefinger , and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it . \\nThey took it back to Apollo , but the god , who had decided to stay away from music for a while \\t, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea . \\nContest with \\tCinyras . \\nCinyras was a ruler of Cyprus , \\twho was a friend of Agamemnon . \\nCinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan \\twar , but did not keep his promise . \\nAgamemnon cursed \\tCinyras . \\nHe invoked Apollo and asked the \\tgod to avenge the broken promise . \\nApollo then had a lyre-playing contest \\twith Cinyras , and defeated him . \\nEither Cinyras committed suicide when he lost \\t, or was killed by Apollo . \\nPatron of \\tsailors . \\nApollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors \\t, one of the duties he shares with Poseidon . \\nIn the myths , he is seen helping \\theroes who pray to him for safe journey . \\nWhen Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm , \\the quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi . \\nWhen the Argonauts faced a terrible storm , Jason prayed \\tto his patron , Apollo , to help them . \\nApollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light \\tupon an island , where the Argonauts soon took shelter . \\nThis island was renamed `` Anaphe '' , \\twhich means `` He revealed it '' . \\nApollo helped the Greek hero Diomedes , to escape \\tfrom a great tempest during his journey homeward . \\nAs a token of gratitude , Diomedes built a temple in honor \\tof Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius ( `` the embarker '' ) . \\nDuring the Trojan War , Odysseus came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis , \\tthe daughter of Apollo 's priest Chryses , and brought many offerings to Apollo . \\nPleased with this , Apollo sent gentle breezes that \\thelped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp . \\nArion was a poet who was kidnapped by \\tsome sailors for the rich prizes he possessed . \\nArion requested them to let him sing for the \\tlast time , to which the sailors consented . \\nArion began singing a song in praise of \\tApollo , seeking the god 's help . \\nConsequently , numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped \\tinto the water , the dolphins carried him away safely . \\nWars \\t. \\nTitanomachy \\t. \\nOnce Hera , out of spite , aroused the Titans \\tto war against Zeus and take away his throne . \\nAccordingly , when the Titans tried to climb Mount Olympus , Zeus with the help \\tof Apollo , Artemis and Athena , defeated them and cast them into tartarus . \\nTrojan \\tWar . \\nApollo played a pivotal role \\tin the entire Trojan War . \\nHe sided with the Trojans , and sent a terrible plague to the \\tGreek camp , which indirectly led to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon . \\nHe killed the Greek heroes Patroclus , \\tAchilles , and numerous Greek soldiers . \\nHe also helped many Trojan heroes , \\tthe most important one being Hector . \\nAfter the end of the war , Apollo and Poseidon \\ttogether cleaned the remains of the city and the camps . \\nTelegony \\twar . \\nA war broke out between the Brygoi and the \\tThesprotians , who had the support of Odysseus . \\nThe gods Athena and Ares came \\tto the battlefield and took sides . \\nAthena helped the hero Odysseus while \\tAres fought alongside of the Brygoi . \\nWhen Odysseus lost , Athena and \\tAres came into a direct duel . \\nTo stop the battling gods and the terror created by their \\tbattle , Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them . \\nIndian \\twar . \\nWhen Zeus suggested that Dionysus defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods , \\tDionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of Bacchantes and satyrs . \\nAmong the warriors was Aristaeus \\t, Apollo 's son . \\nApollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a \\tbow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm . \\nAfter Zeus urged Apollo to join the \\twar , he went to the battlefield . \\nSeeing several of his nymphs and Aristaeus drowning in a \\triver , he took them to safety and healed them . \\nHe taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent \\thim back to help the army of Dionysus . \\nTheban \\twar . \\nDuring the war between the sons of Oedipus , Apollo favored Amphiaraus \\t, a seer and one of the leaders in the war . \\nThough saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war , Apollo made Amphiaraus \\t' last hours glorious by `` lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam '' . \\nWhen Hypseus tried to kill the hero by a spear , \\tApollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead . \\nThen Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and \\ttook the reins in his hands . \\nHe deflected many spears \\tand arrows away them . \\nHe also killed many of the enemy warriors like \\tMelaneus , Antiphus , Aetion , Polites and Lampus . \\nAt last when the moment of departure came , Apollo expressed his grief with tears in \\this eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus , who was soon engulfed by the Earth . \\nSlaying of \\tgiants . \\nApollo killed the giants Python and Tityos \\t, who had assaulted his mother Leto . \\nGigantomachy \\t. \\nDuring the gigantomachy , Apollo and Heracles blinded the giant Ephialtes by shooting \\thim in his eyes , Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right . \\nHe also killed Porphyrion , the king of \\tgiants , using his bow and arrows . \\nAloadae \\t. \\nThe Aloadae , namely Otis and Ephialtes , were twin \\tgiants who decided to wage war upon the gods . \\nThey attempted to \\tstorm Mt . \\nOlympus by piling up mountains , and threatened to \\tfill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land . \\nThey even dared to seek the hand \\tof Hera and Artemis in marriage . \\nAngered by this , Apollo killed \\tthem by shooting them with arrows . \\nAccording to another tale , Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them ; as \\tthey tried to kill it with their javelins , they accidentally stabbed each other and died . \\nPhorbas \\t. \\nPhorbas was a savage giant king of Phlegyas \\twho was described as having swine like features . \\nHe wished to plunder \\tDelphi for its wealth . \\nHe seized the roads to Delphi \\tand started harassing the pilgrims . \\nHe captured the old people and children and sent \\tthem to his army to hold them for ransom . \\nAnd he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing , \\tonly to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him . \\nHe hung the chopped off \\theads to an oak tree . \\nFinally , Apollo came to put \\tan end to this cruelty . \\nHe entered a boxing contest with Phorbas \\tand killed him with a single blow . \\nOther \\tstories . \\nIn the first Olympic games , Apollo defeated \\tAres and became the victor in wrestling . \\nHe outran Hermes in the \\trace and won first place . \\nApollo divides months into \\tsummer and winter . \\nHe rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the \\twinter months , and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure . \\nDuring his absence , Delphi was under the care of \\tDionysus , and no prophecies were given during winters . \\nMolpadia and \\tParthenos . \\nMolpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of \\tRhoeo , a former lover of Apollo . \\nOne day , they were put in charge of watching their father \\t's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty . \\nWhile they were asleep , the wine jar \\twas broken by the swines their family kept . \\nWhen the sisters woke up and saw what had happened , they \\tthrew themselves off a cliff in fear of their father 's wrath . \\nApollo , who was passing by , caught them and carried them to \\ttwo different cities in Chersonesus , Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus . \\nHe turned them into goddesses and \\tthey both received divine honors . \\nMolpadia 's name was changed \\tto Hemithea upon her deification . \\nPrometheus \\t. \\nPrometheus was the titan who was \\tpunished by Zeus for stealing fire . \\nHe was bound to a rock , where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus \\t' liver , which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day . \\nSeeing his plight , Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan , \\twhile Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes . \\nZeus , moved by Apollo 's words and the tears \\tof the goddesses , finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus . \\nThe rock \\tof Leukas . \\nLeukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting \\tout from the island of Leukas into the sea . \\nIt was present in the \\tsanctuary of Apollo Leukates . \\nA leap from this rock was believed to have \\tput an end to the longings of love . \\nOnce , Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis , a young \\tman of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar . \\nHeartbroken , Aphrodite wandered looking \\tfor the rock of Leukas . \\nWhen she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos \\t, she confided in him her love and sorrow . \\nApollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked \\ther to throw herself from the top of the rock . \\nShe did so and was \\tfreed from her love . \\nWhen she sought for the reason behind this , Apollo told her that Zeus , before taking \\tanother lover , would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera . \\nAnother tale relates that a man named Nireus , who fell in love with the \\tcult statue of Athena , came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself . \\nAfter jumping , he fell into the net of a fisherman in which , \\twhen he was pulled out , he found a box filled with gold . \\nHe fought with the fisherman and took the gold , but Apollo appeared to him in \\tthe night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others . \\nIt was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every \\tyear at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil . \\nHowever , a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the \\tcriminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island . \\nThis was the same rock from which , according \\tto a legend , Sappho took her suicidal leap . \\nFemale \\tlovers . \\nLove affairs ascribed to Apollo are \\ta late development in Greek mythology . \\nTheir vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance \\t, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination . \\nDaphne was a nymph who scorned Apollo \\t's advances and ran away from him . \\nWhen Apollo chased her in order to persuade her \\t, she changed herself into a laurel tree . \\nAccording to other versions , she cried for help during the chase , and Gaia \\thelped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place . \\nAccording to Roman poet Ovid , the chase was brought about by Cupid , who \\thit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred . \\nThe myth explains the origin of the laurel and connection of Apollo with \\tthe laurel and its leaves , which his priestess employed at Delphi . \\nThe leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths \\twere given to the victors of the Pythian games . \\nApollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses , and \\tnot being able to choose one of them , decided to remain unwed . \\nHe fathered the Corybantes by the Muse Thalia , Orpheus by Calliope , Linus of \\tThrace by Calliope or Urania and Hymenaios ( Hymen ) by one of the Muses . \\nIn the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesoid \\t, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate . \\nCyrene was a Thessalian \\tprincess whom Apollo loved . \\nIn her honor , he built the \\tcity Cyrene and made her its ruler . \\nShe was later granted longevity by Apollo \\twho turned her into a nymph . \\nThe couple had two sons \\t, Aristaeus , and Idmon . \\nEvadne was a nymph daughter of \\tPoseidon and a lover of Apollo . \\nShe bore him a \\tson , Iamos . \\nDuring the time of the childbirth , Apollo sent \\tEileithyia , the goddess of childbirth to assist her . \\nRhoeo , a princess of the island \\tof Naxos was loved by Apollo . \\nOut of affection for her , \\tApollo turned her sisters into goddesses . \\nOn the island Delos she bore \\tApollo a son named Anius . \\nNot wanting to have the child , she \\tentrusted the infant to Apollo and left . \\nApollo raised and educated the \\tchild on his own . \\nOurea , a daughter of Poseidon , fell in love with \\tApollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king Laomedon . \\nThey both united on the day \\tthe walls of Troy were built . \\nShe bore to Apollo a son , whom Apollo named Ileus , \\tafter the city of his birth , Ilion ( Troy ) . \\nIleus was very \\tdear to Apollo . \\nThero , daughter of Phylas , a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams , \\twas loved by the radiant Apollo , and she loved him in return . \\nBy their union , she became mother of Chaeron , \\twho was famed as `` the tamer of horses '' . \\nHe later built \\tthe city Chaeronea . \\nHyrie or Thyrie was \\tthe mother of Cycnus . \\nApollo turned both the mother and son into swans when \\tthey jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves . \\nHecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy , \\tand Apollo had a son with her named Troilus . \\nAn oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as \\tlong as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive . \\nHe was ambushed and killed by Achilleus , \\tand Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles . \\nAfter the sack of Troy , Hecuba \\twas taken to Lycia by Apollo . \\nCoronis was daughter of Phlegyas \\t, King of the Lapiths . \\nWhile pregnant with Asclepius , Coronis fell in love with \\tIschys , son of Elatus and slept with him . \\nWhen Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his \\traven who informed him , he sent his sister , Artemis , to kill Coronis . \\nApollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis ' belly \\tand gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise . \\nDryope , the daughter of Dryops , was impregnated \\tby Apollo in the form of a snake . \\nShe gave birth to \\ta son named Amphissus . \\nIn Euripides ' play `` Ion '' , Apollo \\tfathered Ion by Creusa , wife of Xuthus . \\nHe used his powers to conceal \\ther pregnancy from her father . \\nLater , when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild , Apollo asked Hermes to save the \\tchild and bring him to the oracle at Delphi , where he was raised by a priestess . \\nApollo loved and kidnapped an \\tOceanid nymph , Melia . \\nHer father Oceanus sent one of his sons , Caanthus , to find her , but \\tCaanthus could not take her back from Apollo , so he burned Apollo 's sanctuary . \\nIn retaliation , Apollo \\tshot and killed Caanthus . \\nMale \\tlovers . \\nHyacinth ( or Hyacinthus ) , a beautiful and athletic \\tSpartan prince , was one of Apollo 's favourite lovers . \\nThe pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off \\tcourse by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head , killing him instantly . \\nApollo is said to \\tbe filled with grief . \\nOut of Hyacinthus ' blood , Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his \\tdeath , and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning `` alas '' . \\nHe was later resurrected \\tand taken to heaven . \\nThe festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta \\t, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus . \\nAnother male lover was Cyparissus \\t, a descendant of Heracles . \\nApollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally \\tkilled it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth . \\nCyparissus was so saddened by its death that he \\tasked Apollo to let his tears fall forever . \\nApollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him , which was \\tsaid to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk . \\nAdmetus , the king of Pherae \\t, was also Apollo 's lover . \\nDuring his exile , which lasted either for one year \\tor nine years , Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman . \\nThe romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria \\t, who wrote that Apollo was `` fired with love '' for Admetus . \\nPlutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo 's lovers and \\tsays that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him . \\nLatin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god , \\tApollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus . \\nTibullus describes Apollo 's love to the king as `` servitium amoris '' ( slavery of \\tlove ) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice . \\nHe would also make cheese \\tand serve it to Admetus . \\nHis domestic actions caused \\tembarrassment to his family . \\nWhen Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis , Apollo provided a \\tchariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed . \\nThis satisfied Alcestis ' father and \\the let Admetus marry his daughter . \\nFurther , Apollo saved the king from Artemis ' wrath and \\talso convinced the Moirai to postpone Admetus ' death once . \\nBranchus , a shepherd , one day \\tcame across Apollo in the woods . \\nCaptivated by the god 's \\tbeauty , he kissed Apollo . \\nApollo requited his affections and wanting to reward \\thim , bestowed prophetic skills on him . \\nHis descendants , the Branchides , \\twere an influential clan of prophets . \\nOther male lovers of \\tApollo include : Children . \\nApollo sired many children , from mortal women \\tand nymphs as well as the goddesses . \\nHis children grew up to be physicians , \\tmusicians , poets , seers or archers . \\nMany of his sons founded \\tnew cities and became kings . \\nThey were all \\tusually very beautiful . \\nAsclepius is the most \\tfamous son of Apollo . \\nHis skills as a physician \\tsurpassed that of Apollo 's . \\nZeus killed him for bringing back the dead , but upon \\tApollo 's request , he was resurrected as a god . \\nAristaeus was placed under the care \\tof Chiron after his birth . \\nHe became the god of beekeeping , \\tcheese making , animal husbandry and more . \\nHe was ultimately given immortality for the \\tbenefits he bestowed upon the humanity . \\nThe Corybantes were spear-clashing \\t, dancing demigods . \\nThe sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes Hector and Troilus , as well as \\tTenes , the king of Tenedos , all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war . \\nApollo 's children who became musicians and bards include Orpheus , \\tLinus , Ialemus , Hymenaeus , Philammon , Eumolpus and Eleuther . \\nApollo fathered 3 daughters , Apollonis , Borysthenis and Cephisso , who \\tformed a group of minor Muses , the `` Musa Apollonides '' . \\nThey were nicknamed Nete , Mese and Hypate after the \\thighest , middle and lowest strings of his lyre . \\nPhemonoe was a seer and a poetess \\twho was the inventor of Hexameter . \\nApis , Idmon , Iamus , Tenerus , Mopsus \\t, Galeus , Telmessus and others were gifted seers . \\nAnius , Pythaeus and Ismenus \\tlived as high priests . \\nMost of them were \\ttrained by Apollo himself . \\nArabus , Delphos , Dryops , Miletos , Tenes , Epidaurus , Ceos , Lycoras , Syrus , Pisus , Marathus , Megarus , \\tPatarus , Acraepheus , Cicon , Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo , under the guidance of his words , founded eponymous cities . \\nHe also had a son named \\tChrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist . \\nHis other daughters include Eurynome , Chariclo wife of Chiron , Eurydice the wife of Orpheus , Eriopis , famous for her beautiful \\thair , Melite the heroine , Pamphile the silk weaver , Parthenos , and by some accounts , Phoebe , Hilyra and Scylla . \\nApollo turned Parthenos into a \\tconstellation after her early death . \\nAdditionally , Apollo fostered and educated Chiron , the centaur who later became \\tthe greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including Apollo 's sons . \\nApollo also fostered Carnus , the \\tson of Zeus and Europa . \\nFailed love \\tattempts . \\nMarpessa was kidnapped by Idas but \\twas loved by Apollo as well . \\nZeus made her choose between them , and she chose Idas on the grounds \\tthat Apollo , being immortal , would tire of her when she grew old . \\nSinope , a nymph , was \\tapproached by the amorous Apollo . \\nShe made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask \\tfor , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin . \\nApollo kept his promise \\tand went back . \\nBolina was admired by Apollo but she \\trefused him and jumped into the sea . \\nTo avoid her death , Apollo turned her \\tinto a nymph , saving her life . \\nCastalia was a nymph \\twhom Apollo loved . \\nShe fled from him and dove into the spring \\tat Delphi , at the base of Mt . \\nParnassos , which was \\tthen named after her . \\nWater from this spring was sacred ; it was used \\tto clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses . \\nCassandra , was a daughter \\tof Hecuba and Priam . \\nApollo wished to \\tcourt her . \\nCassandra promised to return his love on one condition - \\the should give her the power to see the future . \\nApollo fulfilled her wish , but she went back \\ton her word and rejected him soon after . \\nAngered that she broke her promise , Apollo cursed her that even though \\tshe would see the future , no one would ever believe her prophecies . \\nHestia , the goddess of the hearth , rejected both Apollo 's and \\tPoseidon 's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried . \\nFemale \\tcounterparts . \\nArtemis \\t. \\nArtemis as the sister of Apollo , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , \\tshe as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity . \\nIn the pre-Hellenic period , their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife , \\tand there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo . \\nHowever , this relationship was never sexual but spiritual , which is \\twhy they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period . \\nArtemis , like her brother , is \\tarmed with a bow and arrows . \\nShe is the cause of \\tsudden deaths of women . \\nShe also is the protector of \\tthe young , especially girls . \\nThough she has nothing to do with oracles , music or poetry \\t, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang . \\nThe laurel ( `` daphne '' \\t) was sacred to both . \\n`` Artemis Daphnaia '' had her temple among \\tthe Lacedemonians , at a place called Hypsoi . \\n`` Apollo Daphnephoros '' had a temple in Eretria , a \\t`` place where the citizens are to take the oaths '' . \\nIn later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun \\tor Helios , Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon . \\nHecate \\t. \\nHecate , the goddess of witchcraft and magic \\t, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo . \\nThey both are cousins , since their mothers \\t- Leto and Asteria - are sisters . \\nOne of Apollo 's epithets , `` Hecatos '' , is the masculine form \\tof Hecate , and both the names mean `` working from afar '' . \\nWhile Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven , \\tHecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness . \\nIf Hecate is the `` gate-keeper '' , Apollo \\t`` Agyieus '' is the `` door-keeper '' . \\nHecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo \\tis the god and protector of streets . \\nThe oldest evidence found for Hecate 's worship \\tis at Apollo 's temple in Miletos . \\nThere , Hecate was taken to be Apollo \\t's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis . \\nHecate 's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and \\tcontrasts and complements , at the same time , Apollo 's solar nature . \\nAthena \\t. \\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power , \\tApollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena . \\nBeing Zeus ' favorite children , they \\twere given more powers and duties . \\nApollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of \\tcities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . \\nAthena was the principle goddess of Athens , \\tApollo was the principle god of Sparta . \\nAs patrons of arts , Apollo and Athena were companions of the \\tMuses , the former a much more frequent companion than the latter . \\nApollo was sometimes called the \\tson of Athena and Hephaestus . \\nIn the Trojan war , as Zeus ' executive , \\tApollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does . \\nApollo 's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena , and they \\tboth worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus . \\nApollo in the \\t`` Oresteia '' . \\nIn Aeschylus ' `` Oresteia '' trilogy , Clytemnestra kills her husband , King Agamemnon \\tbecause he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war . \\nApollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon 's son \\t, Orestes , is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus , her lover . \\nOrestes and Pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently Orestes is \\tpursued by the Erinyes or Furies ( female personifications of vengeance ) . \\nApollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging \\this father , whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage . \\nThey invade his temple , \\tand he drives them away . \\nHe says that the matter \\tshould be brought before Athena . \\nApollo promises to protect Orestes , as \\tOrestes has become Apollo 's supplicant . \\nApollo advocates Orestes at the trial , and \\tultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo . \\nRoman \\tApollo . \\nThe Roman worship of Apollo \\twas adopted from the Greeks . \\nAs a quintessentially Greek god , Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent \\t, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus . \\nThere was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as \\tthe period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus . \\nOn the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE , Apollo 's first temple at Rome was \\testablished in the Flaminian fields , replacing an older cult site there known as the `` Apollinare '' . \\nDuring the Second Punic War in 212 BCE , the `` Ludi Apollinares '' ( `` Apollonian Games \\t'' ) were instituted in his honor , on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius . \\nIn the time of Augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said \\tto be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome . \\nAfter the battle of Actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo , Augustus enlarged Apollo 's \\ttemple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour . \\nHe also erected a new temple to \\tthe god on the Palatine hill . \\nSacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the \\tSecular Games , held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era . \\nFestivals \\t. \\nThe chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years \\tat Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games . \\nAlso of major importance was the Delia \\theld every four years on Delos . \\nAthenian annual festivals included the Boedromia , \\tMetageitnia , Pyanepsia , and Thargelia . \\nSpartan annual festivals were the \\tCarneia and the Hyacinthia . \\nThebes every nine years \\theld the Daphnephoria . \\nAttributes and \\tsymbols . \\nApollo 's most common attributes \\twere the bow and arrow . \\nOther attributes of his included the kithara ( an advanced version \\tof the common lyre ) , the plectrum and the sword . \\nAnother common emblem was the sacrificial \\ttripod , representing his prophetic powers . \\nThe Pythian Games were held in Apollo \\t's honor every four years at Delphi . \\nThe bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and \\tin making the crown of victory at these games . \\nThe palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because \\the had been born under one in Delos . \\nAnimals sacred to Apollo included wolves , dolphins , roe deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing music and song ) , ravens , hawks , crows ( Apollo had hawks \\tand crows as his messengers ) , snakes ( referencing Apollo 's function as the god of prophecy ) , mice and griffins , mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin . \\nHomer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo \\thad a hawk as his messenger . \\nIn many myths Apollo is \\ttransformed into a hawk . \\nIn addition , Claudius Aelianus wrote that in Ancient Egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers \\tof Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called `` hawk-keepers '' ( ἱερακοβοσκοί ) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god . \\nEusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in \\tEgypt and that the city 's symbol is a man with a hawklike face ( Horus ) . \\nClaudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called \\tApollo Horus in their own language . \\nAs god of colonization , Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies \\t, especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 BCE . \\nAccording to Greek tradition , he helped Cretan \\tor Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy . \\nHowever , this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction : Hittite cuneiform texts mention an Asia Minor god called `` Appaliunas '' or `` \\tApalunas '' in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions , which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars . \\nIn this interpretation , Apollo 's title of `` Lykegenes '' can simply be read as `` born in \\tLycia '' , which effectively severs the god 's supposed link with wolves ( possibly a folk etymology ) . \\nIn literary contexts , Apollo represents harmony , order , and reason—characteristics contrasted with \\tthose of Dionysus , god of wine , who represents ecstasy and disorder . \\nThe contrast between the roles of these gods \\tis reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian . \\nHowever , the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary : the two gods are brothers , \\tand when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea , he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus . \\nThis contrast appears to be shown on \\tthe two sides of the Borghese Vase . \\nApollo is often associated \\twith the Golden Mean . \\nThis is the Greek ideal of moderation \\tand a virtue that opposes gluttony . \\nIn antiquity , Apollo was \\tassociated with the planet Mercury . \\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening \\t, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before . \\nThe morning planet was called Apollo , and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they \\twere the same , thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes ' was kept , and 'Apollo ' was dropped . \\nApollo in \\tthe arts . \\nApollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman \\tart and also in the art of the Renaissance . \\nThe earliest Greek word for a statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' \\t) , and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision . \\nGreek art puts into Apollo the highest degree \\tof power and beauty that can be imagined . \\nThe sculptors derived this from observations on human beings , but they also \\tembodied in concrete form , issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought . \\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the \\tcult of the body that was essentially a religious activity . \\nThe muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for \\thealth , and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment . \\nThe statues of Apollo embody beauty , balance and \\tinspire awe before the beauty of the world . \\nArchaic \\tsculpture . \\nNumerous free-standing statues of male youths from Archaic Greece exist , and were once thought \\tto be representations of Apollo , though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals . \\nIn 1895 , V.

Leonardos proposed the term `` kouros '' ( `` male youth '' ) to refer to \\tthose from Keratea ; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format . \\nThe earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two \\tfigures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos . \\nSuch statues were found across the Greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries \\tof Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of `` Apollo Ptoios '' , Boeotia alone . \\nSignificantly more rare are \\tthe life-sized bronze statues . \\nOne of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was \\tdescribed as `` a miracle '' by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze , `` Piraeus Apollo '' . \\nIt was found in Piraeus , a port city close to \\tAthens , and is believed to have come from north-eastern Peloponnesus . \\nIt is the only \\tsurviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue . \\nClassical \\tsculpture . \\nThe famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type , in \\twhich the god holds the cithara , a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre , in his left arm . \\nWhile none of the Greek originals have survived , several Roman \\tcopies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist . \\nOther notable forms are the Apollo \\tCitharoedus and the Apollo Barberini . \\nHellenistic \\tGreece-Rome . \\nApollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a cithara ( as Apollo Citharoedus ) or \\tbow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types ) . \\nThe Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for centuries \\tit epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans , from the Renaissance through the 19th century . \\nThe marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original \\tby the Greek sculptor Leochares , made between 350 and 325 BCE . \\nThe life-size so-called `` Adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of a `` villa suburbana '' \\tnear the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars . \\nIn the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem , Roman `` Thysdrus '' , he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo \\t, though now even a god 's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak , a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire . \\nAnother haloed Apollo in mosaic , from Hadrumentum \\t, is in the museum at Sousse . \\nThe conventions of this representation , head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling hair cut \\tin locks grazing the neck , were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great . \\nSome time after this mosaic was executed , the earliest \\tdepictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed . \\nModern \\treception . \\nApollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his \\tstatus as the god of music , dance and poetry . \\nPostclassical art \\tand literature . \\nDance and \\tmusic . \\nApollo has featured in dance \\tand music in modern culture . \\nPercy Bysshe Shelley composed a `` Hymn of Apollo '' ( 1820 ) , and the god 's \\tinstruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky 's `` Apollon musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . \\nIn 1978 , the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs `` Apollo \\t: Bringer of Wisdom '' / '' Dionysus : Bringer of Love '' . \\nBooks \\t. \\nApollo been portrayed in modern literature , such as when Charles Handy , in `` Gods of Management \\t'' ( 1978 ) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture . \\nApollo represents a 'role ' culture where \\torder , reason , and bureaucracy prevail . \\nIn 2016 , author Rick Riordan published the first book in the Trials of Apollo series \\t, publishing four other books in the series in 2017 , 2018 , 2019 and 2020 . \\nFilm \\t. \\nApollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance , by Keith David in the 1997 animated feature film `` Hercules , '' by Luke \\tEvans in the 2010 action film `` Clash of the Titans '' , and by Dimitri Lekkos in the 2010 film `` '' . \\nVideo \\tgames . \\nApollo has appeared in \\tmany modern video games . \\nApollo appears as a minor character in Santa Monica Studio 's 2010 action-adventure game \\t`` God of War III '' with his bow being used by Peirithous . \\nHe also appears in the 2014 Hi-Rez Studios Multiplayer Online \\tBattle Arena game `` Smite '' as a playable character . \\nPsychology and \\tphilosophy . \\nIn philosophical discussion of the arts , a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian \\timpulses , where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity . \\nFriedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion \\tof the two was most desirable . \\nPsychologist Carl Jung 's Apollo archetype represents what he saw as \\tthe disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance . \\nSpaceflight \\t. \\nIn spaceflight , the 1960s and 1970s NASA program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the Moon was named after Apollo , by NASA manager Abe Silverstein : < /doc > < doc id= '' \\t595 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=595 '' title= '' Andre Agassi '' > Andre Agassi Andre Kirk Agassi ( ; born April 29 , 1970 ) is an American former world No . \\n1 tennis \\tplayer . \\nHe is an eight-time major champion and an Olympic gold medalist \\t, as well as a runner-up in seven other majors . \\nAgassi is the second of five men to achieve the career Grand Slam in \\tthe Open Era and the fifth of eight overall to make the achievement . \\nHe is also the first of two men to achieve the career Golden Slam ( career Grand Slam and Olympic gold medal ) , as well \\tas the only man to win a career Super Slam ( career Grand Slam , plus the Olympic gold medal and the year-end championships ) . \\nAgassi was the first man to win all four singles majors on three different surfaces ( hard , clay and grass ) , and \\tremains the most recent American man to win the French Open ( in 1999 ) and the Australian Open ( in 2003 ) . \\nHe also won 17 Masters titles and was part of the \\twinning Davis Cup teams in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 . \\nAgassi reached the \\tworld No . \\n1 ranking for the first time in 1995 , but was troubled \\tby personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to No . \\n141 in 1997 , prompting many to \\tbelieve that his career was over . \\nAgassi returned \\tto No . \\n1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run \\tof his career over the next four years . \\nDuring his 20-plus year tour career , Agassi was \\tknown by the nickname `` The Punisher '' . \\nAfter suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis ( vertebral displacement ) and a bone spur that interfered \\twith the nerve , Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3 , 2006 , after losing in the third round of the US Open . \\nHe is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation , which \\thas raised over $ 60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada . \\nIn 2001 , the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy \\tin Las Vegas , a K–12 public charter school for at-risk children . \\nHe has been married to fellow \\ttennis player Steffi Graf since 2001 . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nAndre Agassi was born in Las Vegas , Nevada , to Emmanuel `` Mike '' Agassi ( Aghassian ) \\t, a former Olympic boxer from Iran and American Elizabeth `` Betty '' Agassi ( née Dudley ) . \\nHis father is of \\tArmenian and Assyrian heritage . \\nAndre Agassi 's mother , Betty \\t, is a breast cancer survivor . \\nHe has three older siblings – Rita ( last wife of \\tformer number one Pancho Gonzales ) , Philip and Tami . \\nAndre was given the middle name Kirk after \\tKirk Kerkorian , an Armenian American billionaire . \\nEmmanuel Agassi , then a waiter at Tropicana \\tLas Vegas , had met Kerkorian in 1963 . \\nAt the age of 12 , Agassi and his good friend and doubles partner , \\tRoddy Parks , won the 1982 National Indoor Boys 14s Doubles Championship in Chicago . \\nAgassi describes memorable experiences and juvenile pranks with \\tRoddy in his book `` Open '' . \\nWhen he was 13 , Agassi was sent \\tto Nick Bollettieri 's Tennis Academy in Florida . \\nHe was meant to stay for only three months \\t, because that was all his father could afford . \\nAfter thirty minutes of watching Agassi play , Bollettieri , deeply impressed by \\this talent , called Mike and said : `` Take your check back . \\nHe 's here \\tfor free . '' \\nAgassi then dropped out of school in the \\tninth grade to pursue a full-time tennis career . \\nProfessional \\tcareer . \\n1986–1993 : Breakthrough and \\tthe first major title . \\nAgassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed \\tin his first tournament at La Quinta , California . \\nHe won his first match against John Austin , \\tbut then lost his second match to Mats Wilander . \\nBy the end of 1986 \\t, Agassi was ranked No . \\n91 \\t. \\nHe won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the \\tSul American Open in Itaparica and ended the year ranked No . \\n25 \\t. \\nHe won six additional tournaments in 1988 ( Memphis , U.S. Men 's Clay Court Championships , Forest Hills WCT , Stuttgart Outdoor , Volvo International and Livingston Open ) , and \\t, by December of that year , he had surpassed US $ 1 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level . \\nDuring 1988 , he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager \\t( a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005 ) . \\nHis year-end ranking \\twas No . \\n3 , behind second-ranked Ivan \\tLendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander . \\nBoth the Association of Tennis Professionals and `` Tennis '' magazine \\tnamed Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988 . \\nIn addition to not playing the Australian Open ( which later became his best Grand Slam event ) for the first eight years of his career , Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through \\t1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event 's traditionalism , particularly its `` predominantly white '' dress code to which players at the event are required to conform . \\nStrong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was \\tquickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion . \\nWhile still a teenager , he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open \\tand the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semi-finals in 1989 . \\nHe began the 1990s with \\ta series of near-misses . \\nHe reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open , where he was favored before losing in four \\tsets to Andrés Gómez , which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match . \\nHe reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the \\tUS Open , defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semi-finals . \\nHis opponent in the final was Pete Sampras ; a year earlier , Agassi had crushed Sampras , after which time \\the told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro . \\nAgassi lost the US Open final \\tto Sampras in three sets . \\nThe Agassi-Sampras rivalry became the biggest one in \\ttennis over the rest of the decade . \\nAgassi ended 1990 on a high note as he helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in \\t8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup , beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final . \\nIn 1991 , Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final \\t, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier . \\nCourier emerged the victor \\tin a five-set final . \\nAgassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991 , leading to weeks \\tof speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear . \\nHe eventually emerged for the first \\tround in a completely white outfit . \\nHe reached the quarterfinals on that occasion , \\tlosing in five sets to David Wheaton . \\nAgassi 's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon , not at the \\tFrench Open or the US Open , where he had previously enjoyed success . \\nIn 1992 , he defeated Goran \\tIvanišević in a five-set final . \\nAlong the way , Agassi overcame two former \\tWimbledon champions : Boris Becker and John McEnroe . \\nNo other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon \\tuntil Lleyton Hewitt ten years later . \\nAgassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports \\tPersonality of the Year in 1992 . \\nAgassi once again played on the United States \\t' Davis Cup winning team in 1992 . \\nIt was their second Davis \\tcup title in three years . \\nAgassi famously played the game wearing Oakley brand sunglasses , and a photo of \\thim from the day appeared on the cover of `` Tennis '' magazine . \\nIn his memoir , he wrote that he was covering up bloodshot eyes from a hangover and claimed that the \\tfounder of Oakley , Jim Jannard , had sent him a Dodge Viper to thank him for the inadvertent publicity . \\nIn 1993 , Agassi won the only doubles title of his \\tcareer , at the Cincinnati Masters , partnered with Petr Korda . \\nHe missed much of the early part \\tof that year due to injuries . \\nAlthough he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title \\tdefense , he lost to eventual champion and No . \\n1 Pete Sampras \\tin five sets . \\nAgassi lost in the first round at the US Open to \\tThomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year . \\n1994–1997 : Rise to the top \\t, Olympic Gold and the fall . \\nWith new coach Brad Gilbert on board , Agassi began to employ \\tmore of a tactical , consistent approach , which fueled his resurgence . \\nHe started slowly in 1994 , losing in the \\tfirst week at the French Open and Wimbledon . \\nNevertheless , he emerged during the hard-court \\tseason , winning the Canadian Open . \\nHis comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open \\twith a five-set fourth-round victory against Michael Chang . \\nHe then became the first man to capture the US Open \\tas an unseeded player , beating Michael Stich in the final . \\nAlong the way , he \\tbeat 5 seeded players . \\nIn 1995 , Agassi shaved his balding head , breaking \\twith his old `` image is everything '' style . \\nHe competed in the 1995 Australian Open ( his first appearance at the \\tevent ) and won , beating defending champion Sampras in a four-set final . \\nAgassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995 \\t, all on hardcourt , with Agassi winning three . \\nAgassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ( Cincinnati , Key \\tBiscayne , and the Canadian Open ) and seven titles total . \\nHe compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit , with the last \\tvictory being in an intense late-night four-set semi-final of the US Open against Boris Becker . \\nThe streak ended the next day when \\tAgassi lost the final to Sampras . \\nAgassi admitted this loss , which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their \\thead-to-head meetings , took two years for him to get over it mentally . \\nAgassi reached the \\tworld No . \\n1 ranking for the first \\ttime in April 1995 . \\nHe held that ranking until November , \\tfor a total of 30 weeks . \\nAgassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which \\tallowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked No . \\n1 at the \\tyear-end ranking . \\nIn terms of win–loss record , \\t1995 was Agassi 's best year . \\nHe won 73 and lost 9 matches , and was also once again a key player on \\tthe United States ' Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of his career . \\n1996 was a less successful year for Agassi , \\tas he failed to reach any Grand Slam final . \\nHe suffered two early-round losses to Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon \\t, respectively , and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi-finals . \\nAt the time , Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions , but later said in his biography that he had \\tlost the match on purpose , as he did not want to play Boris Becker , whom he would have faced in that final . \\nThe high point for Agassi was winning the men 's singles gold medal at \\tthe Olympic Games in Atlanta , beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final . \\nAgassi also successfully defended his singles \\ttitles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne . \\n1997 was the low point \\tof Agassi 's career . \\nHis wrist injury resurfaced , and he \\tplayed only 24 matches during the year . \\nHe later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at \\tthat time , allegedly on the urging of a friend . \\nHe failed an ATP drug test , but wrote a \\tletter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink . \\nThe ATP dropped the failed \\tdrug test as a warning . \\nIn his autobiography , Agassi admitted \\tthat the letter was a lie . \\nHe quit the \\tdrug soon after . \\nAt this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress , \\tmodel , and socialite Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game . \\nHe won no top-level titles , \\tand his ranking sank to No . \\n141 on November 10 , 1997 , prompting many to believe that his run as one of \\tthe sport 's premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships . \\n1998–2003 : Return to glory \\tand Career Super Slam . \\nIn 1998 , Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by \\tplaying in Challenger Series tournaments , a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world 's top 50 . \\nAfter returning to top physical and mental shape , Agassi recorded the most successful period of his \\ttennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter . \\nIn 1998 , Agassi won five \\ttitles and leapt from No . \\n110 to \\tNo . \\n6 , the highest jump into the top 10 \\tmade by any player during a calendar year . \\nAt Wimbledon , he had an early loss \\tin the second round to Tommy Haas . \\nHe won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series \\ttournament in Key Biscayne , losing to Marcelo Ríos , who became No . \\n1 as \\ta result . \\nAt the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for \\tthe second time in his career ( the first being 10 years earlier in 1988 ) . \\nAgassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final , becoming , at the time , only the fifth male player \\t( joining Rod Laver , Fred Perry , Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic ) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career . \\nOnly Laver , Agassi , Federer , Nadal and \\tDjokovic have achieved this feat during the Open Era . \\nThis win also made him the first ( of only four , the next being Federer , Nadal and Djokovic respectively ) male \\tplayer in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces ( clay , grass and hard courts ) . \\nAgassi also became the only male player to win the Career Super Slam , consisting of \\tall four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year-end championship . \\nAgassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon \\tfinal , where he lost to Sampras in straight sets . \\nHe rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open , beating Todd Martin in \\tfive sets ( rallying from a two sets to one deficit ) in the final . \\nOverall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and \\tthe ATP Masters Series in Paris , where he beat Marat Safin . \\nAgassi ended 1999 \\tas the No . \\n1 , ending Sampras 's record of six \\tconsecutive year-ending top rankings ( 1993–98 ) . \\nThis was the only time Agassi \\tended the year at No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi was runner-up to Sampras at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup losing 1–6 \\t, 5–7 , 4–6 despite beating Sampras in the round-robin 6–2 , 6–2 . \\nHe began the next year 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title , \\tbeating Sampras in a five-set semi-final and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final . \\nHe was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand \\tSlam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969 . \\nAt the time , Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events , missing only the Wimbledon title .. 2000 \\talso saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon , where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon . \\nAt the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon , Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat \\tSafin in the semi-finals to end the Russian 's hopes to become the youngest No . \\n1 in the \\thistory of tennis . \\nAgassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final \\t, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open \\ttitle with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément . \\nEn route , he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a \\tsell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie 's last Australian Open . \\nAt Wimbledon , they met again in the semi-finals , where Agassi \\tlost another close match to Rafter , 8–6 in the fifth set . \\nIn the quarterfinals at the US Open , Agassi lost a 3-hour , 33 minute epic match with Sampras \\t, 7–6 , 6–7 , 6–7 , 6–7 , with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match . \\nDespite the setback , Agassi \\tfinished 2001 ranked No . \\n3 , becoming the only male tennis player to finish a \\tyear ranked in the top 3 in three different decades . \\n2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi , as injury forced him to \\tskip the Australian Open , where he was a two-time defending champion . \\nAgassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key \\tBiscayne title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final . \\nAt the US Open , Agassi overcame No.1 ranked \\tand defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals . \\nThis led to what turned out to be the last duel between Agassi and Sampras in final of the US \\tOpen , which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings . \\nThe match was the last \\tof Sampras 's career . \\nAgassi 's US Open finish , along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne \\t, Rome and Madrid , helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No . \\n2 at 32 years \\tand 8 months . \\nIn 2003 , Agassi won the eighth ( and final ) Grand Slam title of his career \\tat the Australian Open , where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final . \\nOn April 28 , 2003 \\t, he recaptured the No . \\n1 ranking to become the oldest top-ranked male player since \\tthe ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days . \\nThe record was later surpassed \\tby Roger Federer in 2018 . \\nHe had held \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking for two weeks , when Lleyton Hewitt \\ttook it back on May 12 , 2003 . \\nAgassi then recaptured \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking once again on June 16 , 2003 , which \\the held for 12 weeks until September 7 , 2003 . \\nThere he managed to reach the US Open semi-finals , where \\the lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero , surrendering his No . \\n1 ranking \\tto him . \\nDuring his career , Agassi held the \\tranking for a total of 101 weeks . \\nAgassi 's ranking slipped when injuries forced him \\tto withdraw from a number of events . \\nAt the year-end Tennis Masters Cup , Agassi lost in the final to Federer , his third time to \\tfinish as runner-up in the event after losses in 1999 and 2000 , and finished the year ranked No . \\n4 \\t. \\nAt age 33 , he had been one of the oldest players to rank \\tin the top 5 since Connors , at age 35 , was No . \\n4 in \\t1987 . \\n2004–2006 : \\tFinal years . \\nIn 2004 , Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semi-finals of the Australian \\tOpen to Marat Safin ; the loss ended Agassi 's 26-match winning streak at the event . \\nHe won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP \\tMasters Series titles , having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg . \\nAt 34 , he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history ( the tournament began in 1899 ) , \\ttied with Roger Federer and surpassed only by Ken Rosewall , who won the title in 1970 at age 35 . \\nHe finished the \\tyear ranked No . \\n8 , one of the oldest players to finish in \\tthe top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was No . \\n7 in \\t1988 . \\nAt the time , Agassi also became the sixth male player during the open era to reach \\t800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles . \\nAgassi 's 2005 began with a quarterfinal \\tloss to Federer at the Australian Open . \\nAgassi had several other deep runs at tournaments , but \\thad to withdraw from several events due to injury . \\nHe lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the \\tfirst round of the French Open . \\nHe won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the \\tfinal of the Rogers Cup , before falling to No . \\n2 Rafael \\tNadal . \\nAgassi 's 2005 was defined by an \\timprobable run to the US Open final . \\nAfter beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in \\tfour sets , Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final . \\nThe most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake , \\twhere he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker . \\nHis other five-set victories were on Xavier Malisse in \\tthe fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semi-finals . \\nIn the final , Agassi faced Federer , who was seeking his second \\tconsecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years . \\nFederer defeated Agassi \\tin four sets . \\nAgassi finished 2005 \\tranked No . \\n7 , his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings , which tied Connors \\tfor the most times ranked in the top 10 at year 's end . \\nAgassi had a poor start to 2006 , as he was still recovering from an \\tankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play . \\nAgassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury , and his back injury and other pains \\tforced him to withdraw from several other events , eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open . \\nThis caused his ranking to drop out of \\tthe top 10 for the last time . \\nAgassi returned for the grass-court season , \\tplaying a tune-up , and then Wimbledon . \\nHe was defeated in the \\tthird round by world No . \\n2 ( and eventual \\trunner-up ) Rafael Nadal . \\nAgainst conventions , Agassi , the losing player \\t, was interviewed on court after the match . \\nAt Wimbledon , Agassi announced his plans \\tto retire following the US Open . \\nAgassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide \\tClassic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile , which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open . \\nAgassi had a short , but dramatic \\t, run in his final US Open . \\nBecause of extreme back pain , Agassi was \\tforced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match . \\nAfter a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel , Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the \\tsecond round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semi-finals . \\nAgassi won in five tough sets as the younger \\tBaghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set . \\nIn his last match , Agassi fell to 112th-ranked \\tbig-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets . \\nAgassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd \\tafter the match and delivered a retirement speech . \\nRivalries \\t. \\nAgassi vs. \\tSampras . \\nThe rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the \\t1990s , as Sampras and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade . \\nThey also had very contrasting playing styles , with Sampras being considered \\tthe greatest server and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time . \\nAgassi and Sampras met 34 times on \\tthe tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20 . \\nThe 1990 US Open was their first \\tmeeting in a Grand Slam tournament final . \\nAgassi was favored as \\the was ranked No . \\n4 at the time , \\tcompared to the No . \\n12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had \\tdefeated Sampras in their only previously completed match . \\nAgassi , however , lost the \\tfinal to Sampras in straight sets . \\nTheir next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the \\t1992 French Open , where they met in the quarterfinals . \\nAlthough Sampras was ranked higher , Agassi \\tcame out winning in straight sets . \\nThey met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993 \\t, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole , levelling the match at two sets apiece ; \\thowever , Sampras prevailed in five sets , and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship . \\nWith both Sampras and Agassi participating , the \\tUS won the Davis Cup in 1995 . \\nThe year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles , meeting \\teach other twice in the finals , and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year . \\nThey met five times during the year , all in the title matches , including the Australian Open , the Newsweek Champions Cup ( \\tnow Indian Wells ) , the Lipton International Players Championships ( now Miami Open ) , the Canadian Open , and the US Open . \\nAgassi won three of the finals , including the Australian Open ; however , \\tSampras took the US Open title , ending Agassi 's 26-match winning streak . \\nAfter Agassi had taken most of the fall \\tseason off , Sampras took over the No . \\n1 ranking for the \\tend of the season . \\nAgassi admitted this loss , which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their \\thead-to-head meetings , took two years for him to get over it mentally . \\nIn the following three years , while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles \\tevery season , Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions . \\nThe next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final \\twas at Wimbledon in 1999 , where Sampras won in straight sets . \\nFor both , it was considered a career rejuvenation , as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in \\tthe previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open . \\nSampras forfeited \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that \\tyear 's US Open , which Agassi went on to win . \\nThey faced each other twice in the season-ending ATP Tour World Championships \\t, with Sampras losing the round-robin match , but winning the final . \\nIn the 2000s , they met three more times \\ton the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests . \\nIn 2000 , the \\ttop-ranked Agassi defeated No . \\n3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the Australian Open in five sets , which was an \\timportant win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against Sampras . \\nIn arguably their most memorable match ever , Sampras defeated \\tAgassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals in four sets . \\nThere were no breaks of \\tserve during the entire match . \\nReruns of the match are frequently featured on television , especially during US Open rain delays , and the \\tmatch is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players . \\nTheir last meeting was the final of the 2002 US Open , which was \\ttheir third meeting in a US Open final , but the first since 1995 . \\nThe match was also notable because they had defeated \\tseveral up-and-coming players en route to the final . \\nSampras had \\tdefeated No . \\n3 Tommy Haas in the \\tfourth round and future No . \\n1 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals \\t, while Agassi had defeated No . \\n1 and defending champion Lleyton \\tHewitt in the semi-finals . \\nSampras defeated Agassi \\tin four sets . \\nThis was the final ATP tour \\tsingles match of Sampras 's career . \\nAgassi vs. \\tChang . \\nMichael Chang was the opponent Agassi faced most \\tfrequently from all the players other than Sampras . \\nThey met 22 times on the \\ttour level with Agassi leading 15–7 . \\nChang , unlike most of Agassi 's big rivals \\t, had a playing style similar to his . \\nBoth players preferred to stay at the \\tbaseline with Chang being more defensive-minded . \\nThe outcome was that most of their meetings \\twere built on long and entertaining rallies . \\nThe rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of \\tthe next great generation of American tennis players and both being of foreign descent . \\nAgassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 US Open \\tand defeating Chang , the defending champion , in the 1990 French Open in a four-set quarterfinal . \\nArguably their best match took place in the \\tround of 16 of the 1994 US Open . \\nWhile both players presented high-quality shot-making , the momentum changed from \\tset to set with Agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory . \\nIt turned out to be the toughest contest on \\this way to his first US Open title . \\nTheir next two Grand Slam meetings came in 1996 , with Chang recording easy \\tstraight-set victories in the semi-finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open . \\nYears after , Agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on \\tpurpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker , who was awaiting the winner in the final . \\nAgassi won the last four of their matches , with the last being \\tin 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly past his prime . \\nAgassi vs. \\tBecker . \\nBoris Becker and Agassi played 14 \\ttimes with Agassi leading 10–4 . \\nBecker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Agassi reversed \\tthe rivalry in 1990 , and won 10 of their last 11 matches . \\nThey first played at Indian Wells \\tin 1988 , with Becker prevailing . \\nTheir most notable match was the 1989 Davis Cup semi-final match , which \\tBecker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks . \\nAgassi , considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass , shocked Becker , a three-time champion \\t, in a five-set quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first Grand Slam title . \\nThe intensity of the \\trivalry peaked in 1995 . \\nBecker won that year 's Wimbledon semi-final after being down a \\tset and two breaks , to eventually win in four sets . \\nIn a highly anticipated rematch in the US Open semi-final , this \\ttime it was Agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets . \\nTheir final match was played at Hong Kong in \\t1999 , which Agassi won in three sets . \\nAgassi vs. \\tRafter . \\nAgassi and Pat Rafter played fifteen \\ttimes with Agassi leading 10–5 . \\nThe rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters , because of the players ' contrasting styles of play , with Rafter \\tusing traditional serve- & amp ; -volley methods against Agassi 's variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons . \\nAgassi led 8–2 on hard courts , but Rafter surprisingly won \\ttheir sole match on clay at the 1999 Rome Masters . \\nThey played four matches at Wimbledon \\twith both winning two matches each . \\nAgassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999 , while Rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters , \\tthe latter two matches being gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played . \\nAgassi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open , in 1995 \\tand 2001 , on his way to the title on both occasions . \\nRafter , however , took their only US Open encounter \\tin 1997 and went on to win the title . \\nAgassi vs. \\tFederer . \\nAgassi and Roger Federer played 11 times , \\tand Federer led their head-to-head series 8–3 . \\nWith the retirement of Sampras , the rivalry against the 11-years-younger Federer , who was another great \\tserver like Sampras , became Agassi 's main rivalry for the final years of his career . \\nAgassi won their first three matches , but \\tthen went on to lose eight consecutive ones . \\nThey first met in just the third tournament of Federer 's career at the \\t1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer 's hometown , with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old . \\nAgassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open \\tand the finals of the Miami Open in 2002 . \\nFederer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003 \\t, when he defeated Agassi in both the round-robin and the final . \\nThey played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned \\tover two windy days , with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets . \\nAt the 2005 Dubai Championships , Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the \\ttwo tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab . \\nTheir final duel took place in the \\tfinal of the 2005 US Open . \\nIn the historic clash of generations , Federer was victorious \\tin four sets in front of a pro-Agassi crowd . \\nThe match was the last appearance \\tby Agassi in any tournament final . \\nAgassi vs. \\tLendl . \\nAgassi and Ivan Lendl played eight times , \\tand Lendl led their head-to-head series 6–2 . \\nAgassi vs. \\tEdberg . \\nAgassi and Stefan Edberg played nine times , \\tand Agassi led their head-to-head series 6–3 . \\nEarnings \\t. \\nAgassi earned more than $ 30 million in prize-money during his career , sixth only to \\tDjokovic , Federer , Nadal , Sampras and Murray to date ( May 2018 ) . \\nHe also earned more than $ 25 million a year through endorsements during \\this career , which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time . \\nPost-retirement \\t. \\nSince retiring after the 2006 US Open , Agassi has participated in a \\tseries of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity . \\nOn September 5 , 2007 , he was a surprise \\tguest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open quarterfinal . \\nHe played an exhibition match at Wimbledon , teaming with his wife \\t, Steffi Graf , to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters . \\nHe played World Team Tennis for the \\tPhiladelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009 . \\nAt the 2009 French Open , Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer , who completed his Career Grand Slam by \\twinning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam , with the trophy . \\nAlso in 2009 , Agassi played at the \\tOutback Champions Series event for the first time . \\nHe played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships at Surprise , Arizona \\t, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin . \\nAgassi returned to the tour renamed for the PowerShares Series in 2011 \\tand participated in a total of seven events while winning two . \\nAgassi beat Courier in the final of the Staples Champions Cup in Boston \\tand later defeated Sampras at the CTCA Championships at his hometown Las Vegas . \\nIn 2012 , Agassi took part in \\tfive tournaments , winning three of those . \\nIn November , at first he won BILT Champions Showdown \\tin San Jose , beating John McEnroe in the final . \\nThe following day , he defended his title of the \\tCTCA Championships , while defeating Courier in the decisive match . \\nIn the series season finale , he beat \\tMichael Chang for the Acura Champions Cup . \\nThe series and Agassi came \\tback to action in 2014 . \\nAgassi won both tournaments \\the participated in . \\nAt the Camden Wealth Advisors Cup 's final in Houston , Agassi \\tbeat James Blake for a rematch of their 2005 US Open quarterfinal . \\nHe defeated Blake again in Portland to win the \\ttitle of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championships . \\nIn 2015 , Agassi took part in just one event of the PowerShares \\tSeries , losing to Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Champions Shootout . \\nThe following year he took part in two events , at first losing to Blake in \\tChicago , and the next day defeating Mardy Fish , but losing to Roddick in Charleston . \\nIn 2009 , in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the \\tfirst time on court since the 2002 US Open final . \\nSampras won the exhibition \\tin three sets . \\nThe rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in \\tthe `` Hit for Haiti '' charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake . \\nPartnered with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , the old rivals began making jokes at each other \\t's expense , which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassi 's body . \\nAfter the event , Agassi admitted that he had crossed \\tthe line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras . \\nAgassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden \\tin New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets . \\nOn March 3 , 2014 , Agassi and Sampras squared off \\tfor an exhibition in London for the annual World Tennis Day . \\nThis time , it was Agassi who came \\tout on top in two straight sets . \\nHe returned to the tour in May 2017 in the \\tposition of coach to Novak Djokovic for the French Open . \\nAgassi announced the end of the partnership on March 31 , 2018 \\t, stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship . \\nPlaying \\tstyle . \\nEarly in his career , Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis , typically by inducing \\ta weak return with a deep , hard shot , and then playing a winner at an extreme angle . \\nOn the rare occasion that he charged the net , Agassi liked to take \\tthe ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner . \\nHis favored groundstroke was his flat , accurate two-handed backhand \\t, hit well cross-court but especially down the line . \\nHis forehand was nearly as strong , \\tespecially his inside-out to the ad court . \\nAgassi 's strength was in dictating play from the baseline , and \\the was able to consistently take the ball on the rise . \\nWhile he was growing up , his father \\tand Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way . \\nWhen in control of a point , Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner \\tand hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors , and to make his opponent run more . \\nThis change to more methodical , less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by \\this longtime coach , Brad Gilbert , in their first year together in 1994 . \\nGilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep , flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to \\twin attrition wars , and noted Agassi 's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot . \\nA signature play later in his career was a change-up \\tdrop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes . \\nThis would often be followed by a passing shot or \\tlob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it . \\nAgassi was raised on hardcourts , but found much of his early major-tournament success on the \\tred clay of Roland Garros , reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career . \\nDespite grass being his worst surface , his first major win was at the slick grass \\tof Wimbledon in 1992 , a tournament that he professed to hating at the time . \\nHis strongest surface over the course of his career , was \\tindeed hardcourt , where he won six of his eight majors . \\nBusiness \\tventures . \\nAgassi established a limited liability company named Andre \\tAgassi Ventures ( formerly named Agassi Enterprises ) . \\nAgassi , along with five athlete partners ( including Wayne Gretzky , Joe Montana , Shaquille O'Neal , Ken Griffey \\tJr. , and Monica Seles ) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996 . \\nThe restaurant closed \\tdown in 2001 . \\nIn 1999 , he paid $ 1 million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank \\tand made a $ 10 million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006 . \\nIn 2002 , he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers \\tand cable and satellite industry , and made an equity investment in the network . \\nAfter meeting chef Michael Mina at one of his restaurants in San Francisco , Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina \\tGroup Inc. and opened 18 concept

Exclusive Resorts \\tto co-develop luxury resorts and design Agassi-Graf Tennis and Fitness Centers . \\nThey also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and \\tboth serve as board members and advisors of the company . \\nIn October 2012 , Village Roadshow and investors including Agassi and Graf announced plans \\tto build a new water park called Wet'n'Wild Las Vegas in Las Vegas . \\nVillage Roadshow has a 51 % stake in the park while Agassi \\t, Graf , and other private investors hold the remaining 49 % . \\nThe park opened \\tin May 2013 . \\nIMG managed Agassi from the time

left Nike after \\t17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas . \\nA major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to \\tAgassi 's charities , and Adidas was more than happy to do so . \\nOn May 13 , 2013 \\t, Agassi rejoined Nike . \\nAgassi was sponsored by DuPont , Ebel , Mountain Dew in 1993 , Mazda in \\t1997 , Kia Motors in 2002 , American Express and

'' \\nHe was married to Brooke \\tShields from 1997 to 1999 . \\nHe married Steffi Graf on October 22 , 2001 , at \\ttheir Las Vegas home ; the only witnesses were their mothers . \\nThey have two children : son Jaden Gil ( born \\t2001 ) and daughter Jaz Elle ( born 2003 ) . \\nAgassi has said that he and Graf are \\tnot pushing their children toward becoming tennis players . \\nThe Graf-Agassi family resides in Summerlin , \\ta community in the Las Vegas Valley . \\nGraf 's mother and brother , Michael , \\twith his four children , also live there . \\nLong-time trainer Gil Reyes has been called one of Agassi 's closest friends ; \\tsome have described him as being a `` father figure '' to Agassi . \\nIn 2012 , Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line \\tof fitness equipment , BILT By Agassi and Reyes . \\nIn December 2008 , Agassi 's childhood friend and former business manager , Perry Rogers \\t, sued Graf for $ 50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him . \\nAutobiography \\t. \\nAgassi 's autobiography , `` '' , ( written with assistance \\tfrom J.

Shorto 's `` Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary '' . \\nLittle work has been done on the Munda \\tlanguages , which are not well documented . \\nWith their demotion from a primary branch \\t, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2005 ) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer \\tas follows : This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for . \\nis better preserved in the Katuic languages \\t, which Sidwell has specialized in . \\nInternal \\tclassification . \\nLinguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic : the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia , Northeast India and the \\tNicobar Islands , and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh , parts of Nepal . \\nHowever , no evidence for this \\tclassification has ever been published . \\nEach of the families that is written in boldface \\ttype below is accepted as a valid clade . \\nBy contrast , the relationships `` between \\t'' these families within Austroasiatic are debated . \\nIn addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposals are given , \\tneither of which accepts traditional `` Mon–Khmer '' as a valid unit . \\nHowever , little of the data used for competing classifications has ever \\tbeen published , and therefore can not be evaluated by peer review . \\nIn addition , there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra ( \\tDiffloth ) , the Chamic languages of Vietnam , and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo ( Adelaar 1995 ) . \\nDiffloth ( \\t1974 ) . \\nDiffloth 's widely cited original classification , now abandoned by Diffloth himself , is used \\tin `` Encyclopædia Britannica '' and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in `` Ethnologue . '' \\nPeiros ( \\t2004 ) . \\nPeiros is a lexicostatistic classification , \\tbased on percentages of shared vocabulary . \\nThis means that languages can appear to be more distantly \\trelated than they actually are due to language contact . \\nIndeed , when Sidwell ( 2009 ) replicated Peiros 's study with languages known well enough \\tto account for loans , he did not find the internal ( branching ) structure below . \\nDiffloth ( \\t2005 ) . \\nDiffloth compares reconstructions of various clades , and attempts to classify them based on \\tshared innovations , though like other classifications the evidence has not been published . \\nAs a schematic , we have : Or \\tin more detail , Sidwell ( 2009–2015 ) . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2009 ) , in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords , finds little evidence for internal branching , though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and \\tKatuic languages , such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches , without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic . \\nHe therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches \\tof Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence . \\nSidwell & amp ; Blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that \\tthere is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node , which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic . \\nIf this would the case , Sidwell & amp ; Blench suggest that \\tKhasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward . \\nSidwell & amp ; Blench ( 2011 ) suggest Shompen as an \\tadditional branch , and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating . \\nIn general , however , the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have \\tdeveloped , since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong river valley relatively quickly . \\nSubsequently , Sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) proposed that Nicobarese subgroups with \\tAslian , just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other . \\nA subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis ( Sidwell 2015b ) suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure , with an east–west division ( consisting \\tof Munda , Khasic , Palaungic , and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present . \\nHowever , he still \\tconsiders the subbranching dubious . \\nIntegrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings , Paul Sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into \\tIndochina from the Lingnan area of southern China , with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China . \\nSidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may \\thave begun to split up 5,000 years B.P . \\nduring the Neolithic transition era of mainland Southeast Asia , with \\tall the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P . \\nAustroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the Pearl River watershed of Lingnan , which \\twould have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam , or downstream through the Mekong River via Yunnan . \\nBoth the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record \\tclearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P . \\ncultivated rice and millet , kept livestock such as dogs , pigs , \\tand chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments . \\nAt 4,500 B.P. , this `` Neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal \\tgrains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures , with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P . \\nand in southern Indochina \\tby 3,800 B.P . \\nHowever , Sidwell ( 2015c ) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic , since each Austroasiatic branch has different \\tterms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai , Chinese , Tibetan , Malay , and other languages . \\nDuring the Iron Age about 2,500 B.P. , relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as Vietic , Katuic , Pearic \\t, and Khmer were formed , while the more internally diverse Bahnaric branch ( dating to about 3,000 B.P . ) \\nunderwent more extensive \\tinternal diversification . \\nBy the Iron Age , all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their \\tpresent-day locations , with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the Austroasiatic language \\tfamily to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P . \\nduring the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina , but notes \\tthat the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date . \\nThe lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided \\tinto an early and late stratum . \\nThe early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts , animal names , natural features , and pronouns , while the names of \\tcultural items ( agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts , which are reconstructible in Proto-Austroasiatic ) form part of the later stratum . \\nRoger Blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies ( such as boats \\t, waterways , river fauna , and fish capture techniques ) can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic . \\nBlench ( 2017 ) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river , \\tvalley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . \\n' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( Central Austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' \\t, 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , fishing bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . \\nArchaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern Indochina ( northern Vietnam , Laos , and other nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years ago \\t( 2,000 BC ) , with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P . \\nSidwell ( 2022 ) proposes that the locus of Proto-Austroasiatic was in the Red River Delta area \\tabout 4,000-4,500 years before present , instead of the Middle Mekong as he had previously proposed . \\nAustroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and \\talso upstream through river valleys . \\nKhmuic , Palaungic , and Khasic resulted from a westward \\tdispersal that ultimately came from the Red Valley valley . \\nBased on their current distributions , about half of all Austroasiatic branches ( \\tincluding Nicobaric and Munda ) can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals . \\nHence , this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic \\tas compared to Sino-Tibetan , whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture . \\nIn addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle , early Austroasiatic speakers would have \\talso had access to livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . \\nAs early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered speakers of \\tolder language families who were already settled in the area , such as Sino-Tibetan . \\nSidwell ( \\t2018 ) . \\nSidwell ( 2018 ) ( quoted in Sidwell 2021 ) gives a more nested classification of \\tAustroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of Austroasiatic languages using a 200-word list . \\nMany of the tentative \\tgroupings are likely linkages . \\nPakanic and Shompen \\twere not included . \\nPossible extinct \\tbranches . \\nRoger Blench ( 2009 ) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches \\tof Austroasiatic that are now extinct , based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages . \\nOther languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are : John Peterson ( 2017 ) suggests that `` pre-Munda '' ( `` proto- '' in regular terminology ) \\tlanguages may have once dominated the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain , and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east . \\nPeterson notes that eastern Indo-Aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to \\tthose of Munda languages , while western Indo-Aryan languages do not . \\nWriting \\tsystems . \\nOther than Latin-based alphabets , many Austroasiatic languages are written with \\tthe Khmer , Thai , Lao , and Burmese alphabets . \\nVietnamese divergently had an indigenous script \\tbased on Chinese logographic writing . \\nThis has since been supplanted by the \\tLatin alphabet in the 20th century . \\nThe following are examples of past-used alphabets \\tor current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages . \\nExternal \\trelations . \\nAustric \\tlanguages . \\nAustroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial Austric hypothesis , which also includes the \\tAustronesian languages , and in some proposals also the Kra–Dai languages and the Hmong–Mien languages . \\nHmong-Mien \\t. \\nSeveral lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatic language families ( Ratliff 2010 \\t) , some of which had earlier been proposed by Haudricourt ( 1951 ) . \\nThis could imply a relation or \\tearly language contact along the Yangtze . \\nAccording to Cai \\t( et al . \\n2011 ) , Hmong–Mien is at least partially related to Austroasiatic \\tbut was heavily influenced by Sino-Tibetan , especially Tibeto-Burman languages . \\nIndo-Aryan \\tlanguages . \\nIt is suggested that the Austroasiatic languages have some influence \\ton Indo-Aryan languages including Sanskrit and middle Indo-Aryan languages . \\nIndian linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in \\tlanguages such as Hindi , Punjabi and Bengali were borrowed from Munda languages . \\nAdditionally , French linguist Jean Przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the Austroasiatic realm \\tand the Indian mythological stories of Matsyagandha ( from `` Mahabharata '' ) and the Nāgas . \\nAustroasiatic migrations \\tand archaeogenetics . \\nsuggests that Haplogroup O1b1 , which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern China , and haplogroup \\tO1b2 , which is common in today 's Japanese , Koreans and , are the carriers of early rice-agriculturalists from Indochina . \\nAnother study suggests that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and \\tO1b2 the `` para-Austroasiatic '' lineage of the , Korean and Yayoi people . \\nA 2021 study by \\tTagore et al . \\nfound that the proto-Austroasiatic speakers split from an Basal East Asian source population , native to Mainland Southeast Asia and Northeast \\tIndia , which also gave rise to other East Asian-related populations , including Northeast Asians and Indigenous peoples of the Americas . \\nThe proto-Austroasiatic speakers can be linked \\tto the Hoabinhian material culture . \\nFrom Mainland Southeast Asia , the Austroasiatic speakers \\texpanded into the Indian-subcontinent and Maritime Southeast Asia . \\nThere is evidence that later back migration from more northerly East Asian groups ( such as Kra-Dai \\tspeakers ) merged with indigenous Southeast Asians , contributing to the fragmentation observed among modern day Austroasiatic-speakers . \\nIn the Indian subcontinent , Austroasiatic speakers , \\tspecifically Mundari , intermixed with the local population . \\nFurthermore they concluded that their results do not support a genetic relationship between Ancient Southeast Asian \\thunter-gatherers ( Hoabinhians ) with Papuan-related groups , as previously suggested by McColl et al . \\n2018 , but that these Ancient Southeast Asians \\tare characterized by Basal East Asian ancestry . \\nThe authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with \\tlinguistic identity , pointing to the fragmentation of modern Austroasiatic speakers . \\nLarena et \\tal . \\n2021 could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of Basal East Asians in Mainland Southeast Asia , which \\tare estimated to have formed about 50kya years ago , and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards . \\nEarly Austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage , which split from Ancestral East Asians between 25,000 \\tand 15,000 years ago , and were among the first wave to replace distinct Australasian-related groups in Insular Southeast Asia . \\nEast Asian-related ancestry became dominant in Insular Southeast Asia already between 15,000 years to 12,000 years ago , and may be \\tassociated with Austroasiatic groups , which however got again replaced by later Austronesian groups some 10,000 to 7,000 years ago . \\nEarly Austroasiatic people were found to be best represented \\tby the Mlabri people in modern day Thailand . \\nProposals for Austroasiatic substratum among later Austronesian languages in Western Indonesia , noteworthy among the Dayak \\tlanguages , is strengthened by genetic data , suggesting Austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by Austronesian speakers . \\nA study in November 2021 \\t( Guo et al . ) \\nfound that modern East-Eurasians can be modeled from four ancestry components , which descended from a common ancestor in Mainland Southeast Asia , one being the `` Ancestral \\tAustroasiatic '' component ( AAA ) , which is more prevalent among modern Southeast Asians , and making up the exclusive ancestry among Austroasiatic-speaking Lua and Mlabri people . \\nThe early Austroasiatic speakers are suggested to have been hunter-gatherers but became rice-agriculturalists quite early , spreading from Mainland Southeast \\tAsia northwards to the Yangtze river , westwards into the Indian subcontinent , and southwards into Insular Southeast Asia . \\nEvidence for these migrations are Austroasiatic loanwords related to rice-agriculture found \\tamong non-Austroasiatic languages , and the presence of Austroasiatic genetic ancestry . \\nAccording to a recent genetic study , Sundanese , Javanese , and Balinese , \\thas almost an equal ratio of genetic marker shared between Austronesian and Austroasiatic heritages . \\nMigration into \\tIndia . \\nAccording to Chaubey et al. , `` Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from \\tdispersal from Southeast Asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations . '' \\nAccording to Riccio et al. , the Munda people \\tare likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia . \\nAccording to Zhang et al. , Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia into India \\ttook place after the last Glacial maximum , circa 10,000 years ago . \\nArunkumar et al. , suggest Austroasiatic migrations from Southeast Asia occurred into Northeast \\tIndia 5.2 ± 0.6 kya and into East India 4.3 ± 0.2 kya . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 598 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=598 '' title= '' Afro-asiatic languages '' > Afro-asiatic languages < /doc > < doc id= '' 599 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=599 '' title= '' Afroasiatic languages '' > Afroasiatic languages The Afroasiatic languages ( or \\tAfro-Asiatic ) , also known as Hamito-Semitic , or Semito-Hamitic , and sometimes also as Afrasian , Erythraean or Lisramic , are a language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in the geographic subregions of Western Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa , and parts of the Sahara/Sahel . \\nWith the exception of its Semitic branch , all branches of \\tthe Afroasiatic family are exclusively native to the African continent . \\nAfroasiatic languages have over 500 million native speakers , which is the fourth-largest number of \\tnative speakers of any language family ( after Indo-European , Sino-Tibetan , and Niger–Congo ) . \\nThe phylum has six branches : Berber , Chadic \\t, Cushitic , Egyptian , Semitic , and Omotic . \\nThe most widely spoken modern Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum by far is Arabic , \\ta `` de facto '' group of distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch . \\nThe languages that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native \\tspeakers , concentrated primarily in the Middle East and North Africa . \\nIn addition to the languages spoken today , Afroasiatic includes many ancient languages , such as Egyptian , which forms a distinct branch of \\tthe family ; and within the Semitic family , Akkadian , Hebrew , Phoenician , other Canaanite languages , Amorite , Ugaritic and Aramaic . \\nWhile there is no consensus among historical linguists concerning the original homeland of \\tthe Afroasiatic family or the period when the parent language ( i.e . \\nProto-Afroasiatic ) was spoken , most agree that it \\twas located within a region of Northeast Africa . \\nProposed specific locations include the Horn of Africa , \\tEgypt , the eastern Sahara , and the Levant . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nIn the early 19th century , linguists grouped the Berber , Cushitic and Egyptian languages within a `` Hamitic '' \\tphylum , in acknowledgement of these languages ' genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic phylum . \\nThe terms `` Hamitic '' and `` Semitic '' were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis \\t, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham and Shem , two sons of Noah . \\nBy the 1860s , the main constituent elements within \\tthe broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out . \\nFriedrich Müller introduced the name `` Hamito-Semitic '' for the entire language \\tfamily in his `` Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft '' ( 1876 ) . \\nMaurice Delafosse ( 1914 ) later coined the term `` \\tAfroasiatic '' ( often now spelled `` Afro-Asiatic '' ) . \\nHowever , it did not come into general use until \\tJoseph Greenberg ( 1950 ) formally proposed its adoption . \\nIn doing so , Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that 'Hamitic ' \\twas not a valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race . \\nIn current scholarly usage , the most commonly used names are `` \\tAfroasiatic '' , `` Hamito-Semitic '' , and `` Semito-Hamitic '' . \\nIndividual scholars have also called the family `` Erythraean '' ( \\tTucker 1966 ) and `` Lisramic '' ( Hodge 1972 ) . \\nIn lieu of `` Hamito-Semitic '' , the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term `` Afrasian '' , meaning \\t`` half African , half Asiatic '' , in reference to the geographic distribution of the family 's constituent languages . \\nDistribution and \\tbranches . \\nScholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including at least the following five branches : A sixth family 's inclusion in Afroasiatic is disputed by a minority \\tof scholars : Although there is general agreement on these six families , linguists who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement , in particular : Demographics . \\nIn descending order of the number of speakers \\t, widely-spoken Afroasiatic languages include : Classification history . \\nIn the 9th century the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria became the first \\tto link two branches of Afroasiatic together ; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic . \\nHe knew of Semitic through his study \\tof Arabic , Hebrew , and Aramaic . \\nIn the course of the 19th century \\t, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships . \\nIn 1844 , Theodor Benfey proposed a language family consisting of Semitic , \\tBerber , and Cushitic ( he called the latter `` Ethiopic '' ) . \\nIn the same \\tyear T.N . \\nNewman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa , but \\tthis would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty . \\nFriedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his `` Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` Outline of Linguistics '' ) , and defined \\tit as consisting of a Semitic group plus a `` Hamitic '' group containing Egyptian , Berber , and Cushitic ; he excluded the Chadic group . \\nIt was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) who restricted Hamitic to \\tthe non-Semitic languages in Africa , which are characterized by a grammatical gender system . \\nThis `` Hamitic language group '' was proposed to unite various , mainly North-African , languages , including the Ancient \\tEgyptian language , the Berber languages , the Cushitic languages , the Beja language , and the Chadic languages . \\nUnlike Müller , Lepsius saw Hausa and \\tNama as part of the Hamitic group . \\nThese classifications relied in part on \\tnon-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments . \\nBoth authors used the skin-color , mode of subsistence , and other characteristics \\tof native speakers as part of their arguments for grouping particular languages together . \\nIn 1912 , Carl Meinhof published `` Die Sprachen der Hamiten '' ( `` The Languages of the Hamites '' ) , in which \\the expanded Lepsius 's model , adding the Fula , Maasai , Bari , Nandi , Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group . \\nMeinhof 's model was widely \\tsupported in the 1940s . \\nMeinhof 's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that `` speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous \\twith cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa ' . '' \\nHowever , in the case of the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages ( a concept he introduced ) , it \\twas based on the typological feature of gender and a `` fallacious theory of language mixture '' . \\nMeinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would \\tlater dub `` Nilo-Hamitic '' were in fact Nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages . \\nLeo Reinisch ( 1909 ) had already proposed linking Cushitic and \\tChadic while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic . \\nHowever , his suggestion \\tfound little acceptance . \\nMarcel Cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of a distinct `` Hamitic '' \\tsubgroup and included Hausa ( a Chadic language ) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary . \\nFinally , Joseph Greenberg 's 1950 work led to the widespread \\trejection of `` Hamitic '' as a language category by linguists . \\nGreenberg refuted Meinhof 's linguistic theories and rejected \\tthe use of racial and social evidence . \\nIn dismissing the notion of a separate `` Nilo-Hamitic '' language category , in particular \\t, Greenberg was `` returning to a view widely held a half-century earlier '' . \\nHe consequently rejoined Meinhof 's so-called Nilo-Hamitic \\tlanguages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings . \\nHe also added ( and sub-classified ) the Chadic languages , and \\tproposed a new name , `` Afroasiatic '' , for the family . \\nAlmost all scholars have accepted this classification \\tas the new and continued consensus . \\nGreenberg developed his model fully in his book `` The Languages of Africa '' ( 1963 ) , \\tin which he reassigned most of Meinhof 's additions to Hamitic to other language families , notably Nilo-Saharan . \\nFollowing Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof , he classified the Khoekhoe language as a member of the Khoisan \\tlanguages , a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds . \\nTo Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe , though this view \\thas been discredited as linguists working on these languages regard them as linguistic isolates . \\nDespite this , Greenberg 's classification remains a starting point for modern work on many languages spoken in \\tAfrica , and the Hamitic category ( and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic ) has no part in this . \\nSince the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages ( Berber , Cushitic and Egyptian ) have not been shown to form an exclusive \\t( monophyletic ) phylogenetic unit of their own , separate from other Afroasiatic languages , linguists no longer use the term in this sense . \\nEach of these branches is instead now regarded as \\tan independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family . \\nIn 1969 , Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is \\tan independent branch of Afroasiatic , suggesting for it the new name `` Omotic '' . \\nThis proposal and name have \\tmet with widespread acceptance . \\nBased on typological differences with the other Cushitic languages , Robert Hetzron proposed that Beja \\thas to be removed from Cushitic , thus forming an independent branch of Afroasiatic . \\nMost scholars , however , reject this proposal , and continue to \\tgroup Beja as the sole member of a Northern branch within Cushitic . \\n`` Glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of \\tOmotic has been established , nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge . \\nIt therefore splits off the following groups as small families : South Omotic , Mao , \\tDizoid , Gonga–Gimojan ( North Omotic apart from the preceding ) , Ongota , and Kujarge . \\nSubgrouping \\t. \\nLittle agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic \\t: Semitic , Egyptian , Berber , Chadic , Cushitic , and Omotic . \\nHowever , Christopher Ehret ( 1979 ) , Harold Fleming ( 1981 ) , and Joseph \\tGreenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first . \\nOtherwise : Date \\tof Afroasiatic . \\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian \\tinscription dated to c. 3400 BC ( 5,400 years ago ) . \\nSymbols on Gerzean ( Naqada II ) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date \\tback to c. 4000 BC , suggesting an earlier possible dating . \\nThis gives us a minimum date \\tfor the age of Afroasiatic . \\nHowever , Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic , \\tand considerable time must have elapsed in between them . \\nEstimates of the date at which the \\tProto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely . \\nThey fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC ( 9,500 years \\tago ) , and approximately 16,000 BC ( 18,000 years ago ) . \\nAccording to Igor M. Diakonoff ( 1988 : 33n \\t) , Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC . \\nChristopher Ehret ( 2002 : 35–36 ) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 \\tBC at the latest , and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC . \\nThese dates are older than \\tthose associated with other proto-languages . \\nAfroasiatic \\tUrheimat . \\nThe Afroasiatic `` urheimat '' , the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community , \\tor complex of communities , before the original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages , is unknown . \\nAfroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia , North Africa \\t, the Horn of Africa , and parts of the Sahel . \\nTheir distribution seems to have been influenced by the \\tSahara pump operating over the last 10,000 years . \\nThere is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of the language family existed , but some \\tlink the first speakers to the first farmers in the Levant who would later spread to North and East Africa . \\nOthers argue the first speakers were \\tpre-agricultural and based in Northeast Africa . \\nShared features with Indo-European languages in West Asia related to food production are \\tsuggested by some scholars to support a Levantine origin for Afroasiatic languages . \\nThe Levantine hypothesis does not account for the domestication of plants endemic to the Horn of Africa such as teff , ensete , and niger seed \\tor for the lack of evidence for intrusive agricultural populations or the cultivation of wheat , barley , or sorghum there prior to 3000 BC . \\nA Northeast African origin is supported \\tby the majority of scholars today . \\nThe region includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups \\tin close geographic proximity , which is sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin . \\nIgor M. Diakonoff placed the origin of the Afro-Asiatic languages in northeast Africa , with \\tolder strands south of Egypt , and newer elements straddling the Nile Delta and Sinai . \\nChristopher Ehret argues that Proto-Afroasiatic speakers in Northeast Africa developed subsistence patterns of intensive plant collection and \\tpastoralism , which gave the population an economic advantage that impelled the expansion of the Afroasiatic languages . \\nEhret suggests that a Proto-Semitic- or Proto-Semito-Berber-speaking population migrated from Northeast Africa to the \\tLevant during the late Paleolithic and eventually gave rise to the Natufian culture . \\nThe linguist Roger Blench proposed southwestern Ethiopia as the most likely homeland of Afroasiatic , in \\tpart because of the high internal diversification of the Omotic branch spoken in that region . \\nVarious scholars have hypothesized on the origins \\tof Afroasiatic based on genetic evidence . \\nY Haplogroup E-M215 is common among modern Afroasiatic-speaking groups and has \\tbeen associated with an ancestral Afroasiatic population in Northeast Africa . \\nIn a 2014 autosomal DNA \\tstudy , Hodgson et al . \\npostulate that the Afroasiatic languages may have been spread by an ancestral population ( s ) \\tcarrying a newly-identified non-African genetic component , which the researchers dub the `` Ethio-Somali '' . \\nThe genetic component is prevalent among modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations and is found \\tat its highest levels among those in the Horn of Africa . \\nThe researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population ( s ) probably migrated from the Near East to Northeast Africa in the pre-agricultural period \\t( ~12–23 ka ) and that a descendant population migrated back to the Levant prior to 4000 BC and developed the Semitic branch of Afroasiatic . \\nSimilarities in grammar \\tand syntax . \\nFeatures observed in all known Afroasiatic language families include : Widespread , though not universal , features of the Afroasiatic languages include : One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation \\t( see the table at right ) , with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n j/ , and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /j-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/ . \\nAccording to Ehret ( 1996 ) , tonal languages appear in the Omotic \\tand Chadic branches of Afroasiatic , as well as in certain Cushitic languages . \\nThe Semitic , Berber and Egyptian branches \\tgenerally do not use tones phonemically . \\nThe Berber and Semitic branches share \\tcertain grammatical features ( e.g . \\nalternative feminine endings * -ay/ * -āy ; corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations ) which can be reconstructed for a higher-order proto-language \\t( provisionally called `` Proto-Berbero-Semitic '' by Kossmann & amp ; Suchard ( 2018 ) and Van Putten ( 2018 ) ) . \\nWhether this proto-language is ancestral to Berber and Semitic only , or \\talso to other branches of Afroasiatic , still remains to be established . \\nShared \\tvocabulary . \\nThe following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates , including \\tten pronouns , three nouns , and three verbs . \\nThere are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic , one by Christopher \\tEhret , and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova . \\nThe two dictionaries disagree \\ton almost everything . \\nThe following table contains the thirty roots or so ( out of thousands \\t) that represent a fragile consensus of present research : Etymological bibliography . \\nSome of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include : < /doc > < doc id= '' 600 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=600 '' title= '' Andorra '' > Andorra Andorra \\t, officially the Principality of Andorra , is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the Iberian Peninsula , in the eastern Pyrenees , bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south . \\nBelieved to have been created by Charlemagne , Andorra was ruled by the count of \\tUrgell until 988 , when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell . \\nThe present principality was formed \\tby a charter in 1278 . \\nIt is headed by two co-princes : the bishop of \\tUrgell in Catalonia , Spain and the president of France . \\nIts capital and largest city \\tis Andorra la Vella . \\nAndorra is the sixth-smallest state in Europe , with \\tan area of and a population of approximately . \\nThe Andorran people are a Romance \\tethnic group of originally Catalan descent . \\nAndorra is the world 's 16th-smallest country \\tby land and 11th-smallest by population . \\nIts capital , Andorra la Vella , is the highest capital \\tcity in Europe , at an elevation of above sea level . \\nThe official language is Catalan , but Spanish , \\tPortuguese , and French are also commonly spoken . \\nTourism in Andorra brings an estimated 10.2 \\tmillion visitors to the country annually . \\nAndorra is not a member \\tstate of the European Union . \\nIt has been a member of \\tthe United Nations since 1993 . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe origin of the word Andorra is unknown \\t, although several hypotheses have been proposed . \\nThe oldest is one put forward by the Greek historian Polybius ( `` The Histories '' III , 35 , 1 ) , who describes the Andosins , \\tan Iberian Pre-Roman tribe , as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars . \\nThe word Andosini or Andosins ( ) may derive from the \\tBasque ' , meaning `` big '' or `` giant '' . \\nThe Andorran toponymy shows evidence of \\tBasque language in the area . \\nAnother theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old \\tword Anorra that contains the Basque word ' ( water ) . \\nAnother theory suggests that Andorra may derive from \\t, meaning `` the thickly wooded place '' . \\nWhen the Arabs and Moors conquered the Iberian Peninsula , the valleys \\tof the High Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest . \\nThese regions were not administered by Muslims , \\tbecause of the geographic difficulty of direct rule . \\nOther theories suggest that the term derives from the Navarro-Aragonese `` andurrial '' \\t, which means `` land covered with bushes '' or `` scrubland '' . \\nThe folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite valley of Endor or Andor ( where the Midianites had \\tbeen defeated ) , a name bestowed by his heir and son Louis the Pious after defeating the Moors in the `` wild valleys of Hell '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPrehistory \\t. \\nLa Balma de la Margineda , found by archaeologists at Sant Julià de Lòria , was \\tsettled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees . \\nThe seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing \\tby the groups of hunter-gatherers from Ariege and Segre . \\nDuring the Neolithic Age , a group of people moved to the Valley of Madriu ( the present-day \\tNatural Park located in Escaldes-Engordany declared UNESCO World Heritage Site ) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE . \\nThe population of the valley grew cereals , raised domestic livestock , \\tand developed a commercial trade with people from the Segre and Occitania . \\nOther archaeological deposits include the Tombs of Segudet ( Ordino ) and Feixa del Moro ( Sant Julià \\tde Lòria ) , both dated in 4900–4300 BCE as an example of the Urn culture in Andorra . \\nThe model of small settlements began to evolve \\tto a complex urbanism during the Bronze Age . \\nMetallurgical items of iron , ancient coins , and relicaries can \\tbe found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country . \\nThe sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes ( Stone of the Witches ) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age \\tin Andorra , located in the parish of Canillo , about the rituals of funerals , ancient scripture and engraved stone murals . \\nIberian and \\tRoman Andorra . \\nThe inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the Iberians and historically located in Andorra \\tas the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini ( ) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC . \\nInfluenced by the Aquitanian , Basque and Iberian \\tlanguages , the locals developed some current toponyms . \\nEarly writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century \\tBC by the Greek writer Polybius in his `` Histories '' during the Punic Wars . \\nSome of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d'Enclar ( part \\tof the early Marca Hispanica ) , l'Anxiu in Les Escaldes and Roc de L'Oral in Encamp . \\nThe presence of Roman influence is recorded from the \\t2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE . \\nThe places with the most Roman presence are in Camp Vermell ( Red Field ) in Sant Julià \\tde Lòria , and in some places in Encamp , as well as in the Roc d'Enclar . \\nPeople continued trading , mainly with wine and cereals , with the Roman cities of Urgellet ( the present-day La Seu \\td'Urgell ) and all across Segre through the `` via romana '' Strata Ceretana ( also known as Strata Confluetana ) . \\nVisigoths and Carolingians : \\tthe legend of Charlemagne . \\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire , Andorra came under the influence of \\tthe Visigoths , the Kingdom of Toledo , and the Diocese of Urgell . \\nThe Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 \\tyears , during which time Christianity spread . \\nWhen the Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the \\tIberian Peninsula , Andorra was sheltered from these Arab invaders by the Franks . \\nTradition holds that Charles the Great ( Charlemagne ) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of 5,000 \\tsoldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver , in return for fighting against the Moors near Porté-Puymorens ( Cerdanya ) . \\nAndorra remained part of the Frankish `` Marca Hispanica '' , the buffer zone between the Frankish Empire and the Muslim territories \\t, Andorra being part of the territory ruled by the Count of Urgell and eventually the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell . \\nTradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne , Louis the Pious \\t, writing the `` Carta de Poblament '' or a local municipal charter circa 805 . \\nIn 988 , Count Borrell II of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys \\tto the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya . \\nSince then , the bishop of Urgell , based \\tin Seu d'Urgell , has been co-prince of Andorra . \\nThe first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the `` Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral \\tde la Seu d'Urgell '' ( Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell ) . \\nThe document , dated 839 , depicts the six old parishes of \\tthe Andorran valleys that made up the country 's administrative division . \\nMedieval Age : The Paréages and \\tthe founding of the Co-Principality . \\nBefore 1095 , Andorra had no military protection , and the bishop of Urgell , who knew that the \\tcount of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys , asked the Lord of Caboet for help and protection . \\nIn 1095 , the lord of Caboet and the bishop of \\tUrgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra . \\nArnalda , daughter of Arnau of Caboet \\t, married the viscount of Castellbò . \\nTheir daughter , Ermessenda , married the \\tcount of Foix , Roger-Bernard II . \\nRoger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over \\tAndorra with the bishop of Urgell . \\nIn the 13th century , a military dispute arose between the bishop of \\tUrgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the Cathar Crusade . \\nThe conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of Aragon , Peter III , between the bishop and the count , by the signing of the first paréage , which \\tprovided that Andorra 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix ( whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state ) and the bishop of Urgell , in Catalonia . \\nThis gave the principality its \\tterritory and political form . \\nA second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the \\tcount of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d'Enclar . \\nThe document was ratified by the noble notary Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà \\t, and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited . \\nIn 1364 , the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic ( now spokesman and president of the parliament ) \\tas representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes , making possible the creation of local departments ( comuns , quarts and veïnats ) . \\nAfter being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count John I , the Consell de la Terra or Consell General de \\tles Valls ( General Council of the Valleys ) was founded in 1419 , the second oldest parliament in Europe . \\nThe syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the Justice Courts ( La Cort de Justicia ) in 1433 with the \\tco-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc ( literally `` fire and site '' , a national tax active since then ) . \\nAlthough there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ( Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or Església de Santa Coloma ) , Andorra developed exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th through \\t14th centuries , particularly in the construction of churches , bridges , religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child ( Our Lady of Meritxell being the most important ) . \\nNowadays , the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra 's cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way , with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve \\t, Sant Joan de Caselles , Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters , Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others . \\nThe Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the Catalan \\tlanguage at the end of the 11th century . \\nAndorra was influenced by this language , which was adopted locally decades \\tbefore it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon . \\nThe local economy during the Middle Ages was based \\ton livestock , agriculture , furs and weavers . \\nLater , at the end of the 11th century , the first iron foundries began to appear in Northern Parishes like Ordino , much \\tappreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges , an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century . \\n16th to \\t18th centuries . \\nIn 1601 the Tribunal de Corts ( High Court of Justice ) was created as a result of Huguenot rebellions in France \\t, Inquisition courts coming from Spain and witchcraft-related beliefs native to the area , in the context of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation . \\nWith the passage of time , the co-title \\tto Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre . \\nAfter Henry III of Navarre became king of France , he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head \\tof the French state and the bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra , a political arrangement that still holds . \\nDuring 1617 , communal councils form the sometent ( popular militia or army ) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ( brigandage \\t) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition , organization and competences current today . \\nAndorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ( \\tfargues , a system similar to Farga Catalana ) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade . \\nIn 1371 and 1448 , the co-princes ratified the fair of Andorra \\tla Vella , the most important annual national festival commercially ever since . \\nThe country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers \\t, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors , in Escaldes-Engordany . \\nFounded in 1604 , it took \\tadvantage of the local thermal waters . \\nBy this time , the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms ( wealthy society ) and casalers \\t( rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition ) , deriving from the tradition of pubilla and hereu . \\nThree centuries after its foundation , the Consell de la Terra located its \\theadquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in Casa de la Vall in 1702 . \\nThe manor house built in 1580 served as \\ta noble fortress of the Busquets family . \\nInside the parliament was placed the Closet of the six keys ( Armari de les sis claus ) , \\trepresentative of each Andorran parish , where the Andorran constitution and other documents and laws were later kept . \\nIn both the Reapers ' War and the War of the Spanish Succession , the Andorran people ( \\twhile professing to be a neutral country ) supported the Catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716 . \\nThe reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra , with cultural works such as the `` Book of Privileges '' ( `` Llibre de Privilegis de \\t1674 '' ) , `` Manual Digest '' ( 1748 ) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the `` Polità andorrà '' ( 1763 ) by Antoni Puig . \\n19th century : the New \\tReform and the Andorran Question . \\nAfter the French Revolution , Napoleon I reestablished the \\tCo-Principate in 1809 and removed the French medieval title . \\nIn 1812–1813 , the First French Empire annexed Catalonia during the Peninsular War ( ) and divided \\tthe region into four départements , with Andorra as a part of the district of Puigcerdà . \\nIn 1814 , an imperial decree reestablished \\tthe independence and economy of Andorra . \\nDuring this period , Andorra 's late medieval \\tinstitutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged . \\nIn 1866 , the syndic Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit led the reformist group in a \\tCouncil General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families . \\nThe Council General replaced the aristocratic \\toligarchy that previously ruled the state . \\nThe New Reform ( ) began after ratification by both Co-Princes and established \\tthe basis of the constitution and symbolssuch as the tricolour flagof Andorra . \\nA new service economy arose as a demand of the valley inhabitants and began \\tto build infrastructure such as hotels , spa resorts , roads and telegraph lines . \\nThe authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos \\tand betting houses throughout the country . \\nThe ban resulted in an economic conflict and the Revolution of 1881 , which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic \\ton 8 December 1880 , and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas . \\nThe Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction \\tof casinos and spas by foreign companies . \\nFrom 7 to 9 June 1881 , the loyalists of Canillo and Encamp reconquered the \\tparishes of Ordino and La Massana by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in Escaldes-Engordany . \\nAfter a day of combat the Treaty of the \\tBridge of Escalls was signed on 10 June . \\nThe council was replaced and \\tnew elections were held . \\nThe economic situation worsened , as the populace was divided over the \\t– the `` Andorran Question '' in relation to the Eastern Question . \\nThe struggles continued between pro-bishops , pro-French , and nationalists \\tbased on the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885 . \\nAndorra participated in the cultural \\tmovement of the Catalan Renaixença . \\nBetween 1882 and 1887 , the first academic schools were \\tformed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language , Catalan . \\nRomantic authors from France and Spain reported the \\tawakening of the national consciousness of the country . \\nJacint Verdaguer lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared \\tworks related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer , Joaquim de Riba . \\nIn 1848 , Fromental Halévy had premiered the opera `` Le Val d'Andorre '' to great success in Europe \\t, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War . \\n20th and 21st century : Modernisation of \\tthe country and the Constitutional Andorra . \\nIn 1933 France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the Revolution of 1933 and the FHASA strikes ( Vagues de FHASA ) ; the revolt led by Joves Andorrans ( a labour union group related to \\tthe Spanish CNT and FAI ) called for political reforms , the universal suffrage vote of all Andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA 's hydroelectric power station in Encamp . \\nOn 5 April 1933 Joves \\tAndorrans seized the Andorran Parliament . \\nThese actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 gendarmes and \\tthe mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat . \\nOn 6 July 1934 , adventurer and nobleman Boris Skossyreff , with his promise of freedoms and modernization of the country and wealth through the establishment \\tof a tax haven and foreign investments , received the support of the members of the General Council to proclaim himself the sovereign of Andorra . \\nOn 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell , declaring himself Boris I , King of Andorra \\t, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell and approving the King 's constitution on 10 July . \\nHe was arrested by the Co-Prince and Bishop Justí Guitart i Vilardebó \\tand their authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain . \\nFrom 1936 until 1940 , a French military detachment of Garde Mobile led by well-known Colonel René-Jules Baulard was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the \\tprincipality against disruption from the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain and also face the rise of Republicanism in the aftermath of the 1933 Revolution . \\nDuring the Spanish Civil War , the inhabitants of Andorra welcomed refugees from both sides , and many of them settled \\tpermanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the capitalist era of Andorra . \\nFrancoist troops reached the Andorran border in \\tthe later stages of the war . \\nDuring World War II , Andorra remained neutral and was an important \\tsmuggling route between Vichy France and Francoist Spain , two fascist states . \\nMany Andorrans criticized the passivity of the General Council for impeding both the entry and expulsion of \\tforeigners and refugees , committing economic crimes , reducing the rights of citizens and sympathy with Francoism . \\nGeneral Council members justified the council 's political and diplomatic actions as \\tnecessary for Andorra 's survival and the protection of its sovereignty . \\nAndorra was relatively unscathed by the two \\tworld wars and the Spanish Civil War . \\nCertain groups formed to help victims of oppression in Nazi-occupied \\tcountries , while participating in smuggling to help Andorra survive . \\nAmong the most prominent was the Hostal Palanques Evasion Network Command , which , in contact \\twith the British Mi6 , helped almost 400 fugitives , among whom were Allied military personnel . \\nThe Command remained active between 1941 and 1944 , although there \\twere struggles with pro-Axis informers and Gestapo agents in Andorra . \\nIn the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda , culture and cinematic art not favorable to totalitarian regimes , promulgated in such places as \\tthe Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel , as a meeting place for Free French forces and a route for escorting crashed Allied pilots out of Europe . \\nThe network was maintained after the war , when film societies were formed , where movies , music and books censored \\tin Franco 's Spain were imported , becoming an anti-censorship attraction for the Catalan or foreign public even within Andorra . \\nAndorran Group ( Agrupament Andorrà ) , an anti-fascist organization linked to the Occitanie 's \\tFrench Resistance , accused the French representative ( veguer ) of collaboration with Nazism . \\nThe Andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two \\taxes : mass tourism and the country 's tax exemption . \\nThe first steps toward the capitalist boom date from the 1930s , with the construction of FHASA and the creation of professional banking with Banc Agrícol ( \\t1930 ) and Crèdit Andorrà ( 1949 ) , later with Banca Mora ( 1952 ) , Banca Cassany ( 1958 ) and SOBANCA ( 1960 ) . \\nShortly after activities such as skiing and shopping become a tourist attraction , \\twith the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s . \\nAll in all , a \\trenovated hotel industry has developed . \\nIn April 1968 a social health insurance \\tsystem was created ( CASS ) . \\nThe Andorran government necessarily involved planning , projection and forecasts for the future : with the official visit of the French co-prince Charles de Gaulle \\tin 1967 and 1969 , it was given approval for the economic boom and national demands within the framework of human rights and international openness . \\nAndorra lived an era commonly known as `` Andorran dream '' ( in relation to the American dream ) along \\twith the Trente Glorieuses : the mass culture rooted the country experiencing radical changes in the economy and culture . \\nProof of this was Ràdio Andorra , the top musical radio station in Europe in this period , with guests and speakers of great importance \\tpromoting musical hits of chanson française , swing , rhythm & amp ; blues , jazz , rock and roll and American country music . \\nDuring this period Andorra achieved a GDP per capita and a life \\texpectancy higher than the most standard countries of the current economy . \\nGiven its relative isolation , Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history \\t, with few ties to countries other than France , Spain and Portugal . \\nBut in recent times its thriving tourist industry along with developments \\tin transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation . \\nSince 1976 the country has seen the need to reform Andorran institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty , \\thuman rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands . \\nIn 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d'Andorra , under the name of Executive \\tBoard ( Consell Executiu ) , chaired by the first prime minister Òscar Ribas Reig with the co-princes ' approval . \\nIn 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with \\tthe European Economic Community to regularize trade relations . \\nIts political system was modernized in 1993 after the Andorran constitutional referendum , when the constitution was drafted by the co-princes \\tand the General Council and approved on 14 March by 74.2 % of voters , with a 76 % turnout . \\nThe first elections under the new constitution \\twere held later in the year . \\nThe same year , Andorra became a member of \\tthe United Nations and the Council of Europe . \\nAndorra formalized diplomatic relations with the United States in \\t1996 , participating in the 51st UN General Assembly . \\nFirst General Syndic Marc Forné took part on a speech in Catalan in the General Assembly to defend the reform of the organization , \\tand after three days he took part in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to defend Andorra 's linguistic rights and economy . \\nIn 2006 a monetary agreement with the European Union was formalized that allows Andorra to use \\tthe euro in an official way , as well as coin its own euro currency . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nAndorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the Bishop of \\tUrgell and the president of France as co-princes . \\nThis peculiarity makes the president of France , in his capacity as prince of Andorra , an \\telected monarch , although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people . \\nThe politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative \\tdemocracy with a unicameral legislature , and of a pluriform multi-party system . \\nThe prime minister is \\tthe chief executive . \\nThe current Prime Minister is Xavier Espot Zamora \\tof the Democrats for Andorra ( DA ) . \\nExecutive power is exercised \\tby the government . \\nLegislative power is vested in \\tboth government and parliament . \\nThe Parliament of Andorra is \\tknown as the General Council . \\nThe General Council consists of \\tbetween 28 and 42 councillors . \\nThe councillors serve for four-year terms , and elections are held between \\tthe 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council . \\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes , \\tand the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency . \\nFifteen days after the election , \\tthe councillors hold their inauguration . \\nDuring this session , the General Syndic , who is the head of the \\tGeneral Council , and the Subsyndic General , his assistant , are elected . \\nEight days later , the \\tCouncil convenes once more . \\nDuring this session , the prime minister \\tis chosen from among the councillors . \\nCandidates can be proposed by a \\tminimum of one-fifth of the councillors . \\nThe Council then elects the candidate with the \\tabsolute majority of votes to be prime minister . \\nThe Syndic General then notifies the co-princes , who in turn \\tappoint the elected candidate as the prime minister of Andorra . \\nThe General Council is also responsible \\tfor proposing and passing laws . \\nBills may be presented to the council as Private Members ' Bills by three of the \\tlocal Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra . \\nThe council also approves the \\tannual budget of the principality . \\nThe government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval \\tat least two months before the previous budget expires . \\nIf the budget is not approved by the first day of the next \\tyear , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved . \\nOnce any bill is approved , the Syndic General is responsible for presenting \\tit to the co-princes so that they may sign and enact it . \\nIf the prime minister is not satisfied with the council , he \\tmay request that the co-princes dissolve the council and order new elections . \\nIn turn , the councillors have the power \\tto remove the prime minister from office . \\nAfter a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors , the council \\twill vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the prime minister is removed . \\nLaw and \\tcriminal justice . \\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court , the Criminal Law \\tCourt , the High Court of Andorra , and the Constitutional Court . \\nThe High Court of Justice is composed of five judges : one appointed by the prime minister , one \\teach by the co-princes , one by the Syndic General , and one by the judges and magistrates . \\nIt is presided over by the member appointed by the \\tSyndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms . \\nThe magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court \\t, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court . \\nThe High Court also appoints members of \\tthe Office of the Attorney General . \\nThe Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and \\treviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties . \\nIt is composed of four judges , one appointed by \\teach of the co-princes and two by the General Council . \\nThey serve \\teight-year terms . \\nThe Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year \\trotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court . \\nForeign relations , \\tdefence and security . \\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces \\t, although there is a small ceremonial army . \\nResponsibility for defending the nation rests \\tprimarily with France and Spain . \\nHowever , in case of emergencies or natural disasters , the Sometent ( an alarm ) \\tis called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve . \\nThis is why all Andorrans , and especially the head of each house ( usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house ) should , \\tby law , keep a rifle , even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need . \\nAndorra is a full member of the United Nations ( UN ) , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) , and \\thas a special agreement with the European Union ( EU ) , it also has observer status at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . \\nOn 16 October 2020 , Andorra became the 190th member of the \\tInternational Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , during the COVID-19 pandemic . \\nMilitary \\t. \\nAndorra has a small army , which has historically been raised or reconstituted at \\tvarious dates , but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army . \\nThe basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the \\tsummoning of the Sometent ( a civil defense organization of Andorra , made up of the heads of households ) . \\nBeing a landlocked country , \\tAndorra has no navy . \\nBefore World War I , Andorra maintained an armed militia force of about 600 part-time militiamen under the supervision of \\ta Captain ( Capità or Cap de Sometent ) and a Lieutenant ( Desener or Lloctinent del Capità ) . \\nThis body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by \\ttwo officials ( veguers ) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell . \\nIn the modern era , the army has consisted of a \\tvery small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties . \\nUniforms and weaponry were handed down from \\tgeneration to generation within families and communities . \\nThe army 's role in internal security was largely taken over \\tby the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931 . \\nBrief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National \\tGendarmerie , with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard . \\nThe Andorran Police was reformed in the following year \\t, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles . \\nThe force consisted of six Corporals , one for each parish ( although there are currently seven parishes , there were only \\tsix until 1978 ) , plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action , and a commander with the rank of major . \\nIt was the responsibility of the six corporals , each in his own parish , to \\tbe able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish . \\nThe only permanent section of the present-day \\tSometent is a twelve-man ceremonial unit . \\nHowever , all able-bodied men are technically available for military service , \\twith a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm . \\nAn area weapon such as a Shotgun per household is unregulated , \\thowever ranged weapons such as Pistols and Rifles require a license . \\nThe army has not fought for more than 700 years , and its \\tmain responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions . \\nAccording to Marc Forné Molné , Andorra 's military budget is \\tstrictly from voluntary donations , and the availability of full-time volunteers . \\nIn more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of Sometent during the floods of 1982 in the \\tCatalan Pyrenees , where 12 citizens perished in Andorra , to help the population and establish a public order along with the Local Police units . \\nPolice \\tCorps . \\nAndorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force \\t, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants . \\nThe principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing \\t, criminal detection , border control , and traffic policing . \\nThere are also small specialist units including police dogs \\t, mountain rescue , and a bomb disposal team . \\nGIPA \\t. \\nThe `` Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra '' ( GIPA ) is a \\tsmall special forces squad trained in counter-terrorism , and hostage recovery tasks . \\nAlthough it is the closest in style to an active military force , \\tit is part of the Police Corps , and not the army . \\nAs terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country , the GIPA \\tis commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties , and at other times to routine policing . \\nFire \\tbrigade . \\nThe Andorran Fire Brigade , with headquarters at Santa Coloma , operates from \\tfour modern fire stations , and has a staff of around 120 firefighters . \\nThe service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances ( fire tenders , turntable ladders , and specialist \\tfour-wheel drive vehicles ) , four light support vehicles ( cars and vans ) and four ambulances . \\nHistorically , the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra \\tmaintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires . \\nThe first fire pump purchased by \\tthe government was acquired in 1943 . \\nSerious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a \\tpermanent fire service , and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961 . \\nThe fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time : two at the \\tbrigade 's headquarters in Santa Coloma , and one crew at each of the other three fire stations . \\nGeography \\t. \\nParishes \\t. \\nAndorra consists of seven \\tparishes : Physical geography . \\nDue to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range , Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains \\t, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at , and the average elevation of Andorra is . \\nThese are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream \\t, the Gran Valira river , leaves the country for Spain ( at Andorra 's lowest point of ) . \\nAndorra 's land \\tarea is . \\nEnvironment \\t. \\nPhytogeographically , Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province \\tof the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom . \\nAccording to the WWF , the territory of Andorra belongs \\tto the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests . \\nAndorra had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of \\t4.45/10 , ranking it 127th globally out of 172 countries . \\nImportant Bird \\tArea . \\nThe whole country has been recognised as a single Important Bird Area ( IBA ) by BirdLife International , because \\tit is important for forest and mountain birds and supports populations of red-billed choughs , citril finches and rock buntings . \\nClimate \\t. \\nAndorra has alpine , continental and \\toceanic climates , depending on altitude . \\nIts higher elevation means there is , on average , more \\tsnow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer . \\nThe diversity of landmarks , the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the Mediterranean climates \\tmake the country have a great diversity of microclimates that hinder the general dominance of the high mountain climate . \\nThe great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points , together with \\tthe influence of a Mediterranean climate , develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees . \\nWhen in precipitation , a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and \\tsummer , which can last until autumn ( May , June and August are usually the rainiest months ) . \\nIn winter , however , it is less rainy , except in the highlands , subject to the \\tinfluence of fronts from the Atlantic , which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains . \\nThe temperature regime is characterized , broadly , by a temperate summer and a \\tlong and cold winter , in accordance with the mountainous condition of the Principality . \\nEconomy \\t. \\nTourism , the mainstay of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do \\teconomy , accounts for roughly 80 % of GDP . \\nAn estimated 10.2 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra \\t's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts . \\nOne of the main sources of income in Andorra is \\ttourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground . \\nThe sport brings in over 7 million visitors annually and an estimated 340 million euros \\tper year , sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present since 2007 . \\nThe banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy with revenues raised \\texclusively through import tariffs ( the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19 % of GDP ) . \\nHowever , during the European sovereign-debt crisis of the 21st century , the tourist industry suffered a decline , \\tpartly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain , undercutting duty-free shopping and increasing unemployment . \\nOn 1 January 2012 , a business tax of 10 % was introduced , followed by a sales tax \\tof 2 % a year later , which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter . \\nAgricultural production is limited ; only 1.7 % of the land \\tis arable , and most food has to be imported . \\nSome tobacco is \\tgrown locally . \\nThe principal livestock activity \\tis domestic sheep raising . \\nManufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes \\t, cigars , and furniture . \\nAndorra 's natural resources include hydroelectric power , mineral \\twater , timber , iron ore , and lead . \\nAndorra is not a member of the European Union , but enjoys a special relationship with it , such as being treated \\tas an EU member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products . \\nAndorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions \\tuntil 31 December 1999 , when both currencies were replaced by the EU 's single currency , the euro . \\nCoins and notes of both the franc and the peseta \\tremained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002 . \\nAndorra negotiated to issue its own \\teuro coins , beginning in 2014 . \\nAndorra has historically had one of \\tthe world 's lowest unemployment rates . \\nIn 2019 it stood \\tat 2 % . \\nOn 31 May 2013 , it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by \\tthe end of June , against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members . \\nThe announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Prime Minister \\tAntoni Martí and the French President and Prince of Andorra François Hollande . \\nHollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra \\t`` bringing its taxation in line with international standards '' . \\nBy the mid-2010s , the financial system comprised five banking groups , one specialised credit entity , eight investment undertaking management entities , three \\tasset management companies , and 29 insurance companies , 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nPopulation \\t. \\nThe population of Andorra is \\testimated at ( ) . \\nThe Andorrans are a Romance ethnic \\tgroup of originally Catalan descent . \\nThe population has grown \\tfrom 5,000 in 1900 . \\nTwo-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not \\thave the right to vote in communal elections . \\nMoreover , they are not allowed to be elected as prime minister or to \\town more than 33 % of the capital stock of a privately held company . \\nLanguages \\t. \\nThe historic and official language is \\tCatalan , a Romance language . \\nThe Andorran government encourages \\tthe use of Catalan . \\nIt funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra ( Catalan \\t: ) , and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants . \\nAndorran television and radio \\tstations use Catalan . \\nBecause of immigration , historical links , and close geographic \\tproximity , Spanish , Portuguese and French are commonly spoken . \\nMost Andorran residents can speak one or more \\tof these , in addition to Catalan . \\nEnglish is less commonly spoken among the general population , though \\tit is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts . \\nAndorra is one of only four European countries ( together with France , Monaco , and \\tTurkey ) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities . \\nAccording to mother tongue percentage statistics by the Andorran Government \\treleased in 2018 the principality has the following : Religion . \\nThe population of Andorra is predominantly \\t( 88.2 % ) Catholic . \\nTheir patron saint is \\tOur Lady of Meritxell . \\nThere are also members \\tof various Protestant denominations . \\nThere are also small numbers of Muslims , Hindus \\t, and Bahá'ís , and roughly 100 Jews . \\n( See History of the \\tJews in Andorra . ) \\nEducation \\t. \\nSchools \\t. \\nChildren between the ages of 6 and 16 \\tare required by law to have full-time education . \\nEducation up to secondary level is provided \\tfree of charge by the government . \\nThere are three systems of school , Andorran , French and Spanish , which use \\tCatalan , French and Spanish languages respectively , as the main language of instruction . \\nParents may choose which \\tsystem their children attend . \\nAll schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities , but teachers in the \\tFrench and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain . \\n39 % of Andorran children attend Andorran schools , 33 \\t% attend French schools , and 28 % Spanish schools . \\nUniversity of \\tAndorra . \\nThe Universitat d'Andorra ( UdA ) is the state \\tpublic university and is the only university in Andorra . \\nIt was established \\tin 1997 . \\nThe university provides first-level degrees in nursing , computer science , business administration \\t, and educational sciences , in addition to higher professional education courses . \\nThe only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and \\tthe School of Computer Science , the latter having a PhD programme . \\nVirtual Studies \\tCentre . \\nThe geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a \\tfull academic programme , and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies , connected to Spanish and French universities . \\nThe Virtual Studies Centre ( Centre d'Estudis Virtuals ) at the university runs approximately 20 different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields \\tincluding tourism , law , Catalan philology , humanities , psychology , political sciences , audiovisual communication , telecommunications engineering , and East Asia studies . \\nThe centre also runs various postgraduate \\tprogrammes and continuing-education courses for professionals . \\nTransport \\t. \\nUntil the 20th century , Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside \\tworld , and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation . \\nEven now , the nearest major airports at Toulouse and \\tBarcelona are both three hours ' drive from Andorra . \\nAndorra has a road network of \\t, of which is unpaved . \\nThe two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border near Sant Julià de \\tLòria , and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near El Pas de la Casa . \\nBus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities , with services \\ton most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times . \\nThere are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and \\tToulouse , plus a daily tour from the former city . \\nBus services mostly are run by private companies , \\tbut some local ones are operated by the government . \\nThere are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra 's borders but there are , however , heliports in La Massana ( Camí Heliport ) , \\tArinsal and Escaldes-Engordany with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of Alt Urgell , south of the Andorran-Spanish border . \\nSince July 2015 , Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport has operated commercial flights to Madrid and \\tPalma de Mallorca , and is the main hub for Air Andorra and Andorra Airlines . \\nAs of 11 July 2018 , there are \\tno regular commercial flights at the airport . \\nNearby airports located in Spain and France provide \\taccess to international flights for the principality . \\nThe nearest airports are at Perpignan , France ( from \\tAndorra ) and Lleida , Spain ( from Andorra ) . \\nThe largest nearby airports are at Toulouse , France ( from \\tAndorra ) and Barcelona , Spain ( from Andorra ) . \\nThere are hourly bus services from both \\tBarcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra . \\nThe nearest railway station is Andorre-L'Hospitalet station east of Andorra which is on the -gauge line from Latour-de-Carol \\t( ) southeast of Andorra , to Toulouse and on to Paris by the French high-speed trains . \\nThis line is operated \\tby the SNCF . \\nLatour-de-Carol has a scenic trainline to Villefranche-de-Conflent , as well as the SNCF 's \\tgauge line connecting to Perpignan , and the RENFE 's -gauge line to Barcelona . \\nThere are also direct Intercités de Nuit trains \\tbetween L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre and Paris on certain dates . \\nMedia and \\ttelecommunications . \\nIn Andorra , mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the \\tAndorran national telecommunications company , SOM , also known as Andorra Telecom ( STA ) . \\nThe same company also manages the technical infrastructure \\tfor national broadcasting of digital television and radio . \\nIn 2010 Andorra became the first country to provide a direct \\toptical fiber link to all homes ( FTTH ) and businesses . \\nThe first commercial radio station to broadcast was Radio \\tAndorra , which was active from 1939 to 1981 . \\nOn 12 October 1989 , the General Council established radio and television as essential public services creating and managing the \\tentity ORTA , becoming on 13 April 2000 , in the public company Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra ( RTVA ) . \\nIn 1990 , the public radio was \\tfounded on the Radio Nacional d'Andorra . \\nAs an autochthonous television channel , there is only the \\tnational

Arithmetic mean \\tIn mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean ( ) , arithmetic average , or just the `` mean '' or `` average '' ( when the context is clear ) , is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection . \\nThe collection is often a set of results from an \\texperiment , an observational study , or a survey . \\nThe term `` arithmetic mean '' is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because \\tit helps distinguish it from other types of means , such as geometric and harmonic . \\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean is frequently used in \\teconomics , anthropology , history , and almost every academic field to some extent . \\nFor example , per capita income is the \\tarithmetic average income of a nation 's population . \\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies , it is not a robust statistic \\t: it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values much larger or smaller than most others ) . \\nFor skewed distributions , such as the distribution of income for which a few people 's incomes are substantially higher \\tthan most people 's , the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one 's notion of `` middle '' . \\nIn that case , robust statistics , such as the \\tmedian , may provide a better description of central tendency . \\nDefinition \\t. \\nGiven a data set formula_1 , the `` arithmetic mean '' ( also `` mean '' or `` average '' \\t) , denoted formula_2 ( read formula_3 `` bar '' ) , is the mean of the formula_4 values formula_5 . \\nThe arithmetic mean is a data set 's most \\tcommonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency . \\nIn statistics , the term average refers \\tto any measurement of central tendency . \\nThe arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is equal to the sum of \\tthe numerical values of each observation , divided by the total number of observations . \\nSymbolically , for a data set consisting of the values formula_6 , the arithmetic mean formula_7 is defined by the formula : For example , if the monthly salaries of formula_9 employees are formula_10 , then the arithmetic mean is : If the \\tdata set is a statistical population ( i.e. , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them ) , then the mean of that population is called the `` population mean '' and denoted by the Greek letter formula_12 . \\nIf the data set is a statistical sample ( a subset of the population ) , it is \\tcalled the `` sample mean '' ( which for a data set formula_13 is denoted as formula_14 ) . \\nThe arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimensions , \\tnot only scalar values ; this is often referred to as a centroid . \\nMore generally , because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination ( meaning its coefficients sum to \\tformula_15 ) , it can be defined on a convex space , not only a vector space . \\nMotivating \\tproperties . \\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it \\tinteresting , especially as a measure of central tendency . \\nThese include : \\tContrast with median . \\nThe arithmetic mean may be \\tcontrasted with the median . \\nThe median is defined such that no more than half the values \\tare larger , and no more than half are smaller than it . \\nIf elements in the data increase arithmetically when placed in some \\torder , then the median and arithmetic average are equal . \\nFor example , consider \\tthe data sample formula_23 . \\nThe mean is formula_24 , \\tas is the median . \\nHowever , when we consider a sample that can not be arranged to increase \\tarithmetically , such as formula_25 , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly . \\nIn this case , the arithmetic average is \\tformula_26 , while the median is formula_27 . \\nThe average value can vary considerably from most values in \\tthe sample and can be larger or smaller than most . \\nThere are applications of this \\tphenomenon in many fields . \\nFor example , since the 1980s , the median income in the \\tUnited States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income . \\nGeneralizations \\t. \\nWeighted \\taverage . \\nA weighted average , or weighted mean , is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation. & lt ; ref & gt ; < /doc > < doc id= '' 615 '' url= '' \\thttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=615 '' title= '' American Football Conference '' > American Football Conference The American Football Conference ( AFC ) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the highest professional level of American football in the United States . \\nThe AFC and its counterpart , the National Football Conference ( \\tNFC ) , each contain 16 teams with 4 divisions . \\nBoth conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the \\tNational Football League , and the American Football League ( AFL ) . \\nAll ten of the AFL teams , and three NFL teams , became members \\tof the new AFC , with the remaining thirteen NFL teams forming the NFC . \\nA series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger \\t, thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference . \\nThe current AFC champions are the Cincinnati Bengals , who defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in \\tthe 2022 AFC Championship Game for their third conference championship , and their first since 1988 . \\nTeams \\t. \\nLike the NFC , the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions \\teach with four teams : East , North , South and West . \\nSeason \\tstructure . \\nThis chart of the 2021 season standings displays \\tan application of the NFL scheduling formula . \\nThe Bengals in 2021 ( highlighted in green ) \\tfinished in first place in the AFC North . \\nThus , in 2021 , the Bengals are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the AFC East and NFC \\tSouth ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first-place finishers in the AFC South , AFC West ( highlighted in orange ) , and NFC East ( highlighted in pink ) . \\nCurrently , the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula : Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice ( home and away ) during the regular season , in addition to \\televen other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL : three games are assigned on the basis of a particular team 's final divisional standing from the previous season , and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions . \\nThis assignment shifts each year and \\twill follow a standard cycle . \\nUsing the 2021 regular season schedule as an example , each team in the \\tAFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC East . \\nIn this way , non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the \\texception being the three games assigned based on the team 's prior-season divisional standing . \\nAt the end of each season , the four division winners and three wild cards ( \\tnon-division winners with best regular season record ) in the AFC qualify for the playoffs . \\nThe AFC playoffs culminate in the AFC Championship Game \\t, with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy . \\nThe AFC champion then plays the \\tNFC champion in the Super Bowl . \\nHistory \\t. \\nBoth the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL \\tmerged with the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 . \\nThe AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams , and added two more expansion clubs \\t( the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968 ) before the merger . \\nIn order to equalize the number of teams in each conference , three NFL teams that predated the AFL 's launch ( \\tthe Cleveland Browns , Pittsburgh Steelers , and the then-Baltimore Colts ) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC . \\nThe two AFL divisions AFL East and AFL West were more or less intact , while the NFL 's Century Division , in \\twhich the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967 , was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central . \\nUpon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970 , the newly minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines \\tfor the 1970 season ; the National Football Conference , however , could not agree upon their setup , and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16 , 1970 . \\nSince the merger , five expansion teams have joined the AFC \\tand two have left , thus making the current total 16 . \\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in \\t1976 , they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively . \\nThis arrangement lasted for one season only \\tbefore the two teams switched conferences . \\nThe Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC \\tas a result of the 2002 realignment . \\nThe expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined \\tthe AFC in 1995 . \\nThere have been five teams that \\thave relocated at least once . \\nIn 1984 , the Baltimore \\tColts relocated to Indianapolis . \\nIn 1995 , the Cleveland Browns had attempted to move to Baltimore ; the resulting dispute between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the \\tBaltimore Ravens with the players and personnel from the Browns , while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL . \\nThe Ravens were treated \\tas an expansion team . \\nIn California , the Oakland Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982 , back to Oakland in 1995 , and then to \\tLas Vegas in 2020 , while the San Diego Chargers returned to Los Angeles in 2017 after 56 years in San Diego . \\nThe Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee in 1997 \\t, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers . \\nThe team would change its name again , \\ttwo years later , to the Tennessee Titans . \\nThe NFL would again expand in 2002 , \\tadding the Houston Texans to the AFC . \\nWith the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time \\t, the divisional setup has remained static ever since . \\nBetween 1995 and 2021 , the AFC has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the Super Bowl : New England Patriots ( 10 times ) , Pittsburgh Steelers ( 4 times ) , Denver Broncos ( 4 times ) , Baltimore \\tRavens ( 2 times ) , Indianapolis Colts ( 2 times ) , Kansas City Chiefs ( 2 times ) , Cincinnati Bengals ( 1 time ) , Las Vegas Raiders ( 1 time ) , Tennessee Titans ( 1 time ) . \\nBy contrast , the NFC has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only \\tthe Detroit Lions , Minnesota Vikings , and Washington Commanders missing out on an appearance in the Super Bowl . \\n17 of the 19 AFC champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three \\tquarterbacks - Tom Brady , Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger - in the Super Bowl . \\nThe AFC has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 \\tSuper Bowls , while the NFC has started 16 . \\nLogo \\t. \\nThe merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the \\told AFL logo , specifically the `` A '' and the six stars surrounding it . \\nThe AFC logo basically remained \\tunchanged from 1970 to 2009 . \\nThe 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo , with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars ( leaving \\tfour representing the four divisions of the AFC ) , and moving the stars inside the letter , similar to the NFC logo . \\nTelevision \\t. \\nNBC aired the AFC 's Sunday afternoon and \\tplayoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season . \\nFrom 1998 to 2013 , CBS was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC ; in those years , \\tall interconference games in which the AFC team was the visiting team were broadcast on either NBC or CBS . \\nSince 2014 , the cross-flex policy allows select AFC games ( that involve them playing an \\tNFC team at home or intraconference games ) to be moved from CBS to Fox . \\nSince 1990 , select AFC playoff games \\thave been seen on ABC or ESPN . \\nSee \\talso .

Farm Animal Farm is a beast fable , in the form of satirical allegorical novella , by George Orwell , first published in England on 17 August 1945 . \\nIt tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , \\thoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . \\nUltimately , the rebellion is betrayed , and under the dictatorship of a pig named \\tNapoleon , the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before . \\nAccording to Orwell , `` Animal Farm '' reflects events leading up to the Russian \\tRevolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union . \\nOrwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism , an attitude that was \\tcritically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona May Days conflicts between the POUM and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War . \\nIn a letter to Yvonne Davet , Orwell described `` Animal Farm '' as a satirical tale against Stalin ( `` '' ) , and in his essay `` Why I Write '' ( 1946 ) , \\twrote that `` Animal Farm '' was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , `` to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole '' . \\nThe original title was `` Animal Farm : A Fairy Story '' , but US publishers dropped the subtitle when it was \\tpublished in 1946 , and only one of the translations during Orwell 's lifetime , the Telugu version , kept it . \\nOther titular variations include subtitles like `` A \\tSatire '' and `` A Contemporary Satire '' . \\nOrwell suggested the title ' for the French translation , which abbreviates to URSA \\t, the Latin word for `` bear '' , a symbol of Russia . \\nIt also played on the French name \\tof the Soviet Union , ' . \\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944 , when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with \\tthe Soviet Union against Nazi Germany , and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon Orwell hated . \\nThe manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers , \\tincluding one of Orwell 's own , Victor Gollancz , which delayed its publication . \\nIt became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international \\trelations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the Cold War . \\n`` Time '' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; it also featured \\tat number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels , and number 46 on the BBC 's The Big Read poll . \\nIt won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is \\tincluded in the Great Books of the Western World selection . \\nPlot \\tsummary . \\nThe poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon , England , is ripened for rebellion from its \\tanimal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer , Mr. Jones . \\nOne night , the exalted boar , Old Major , holds a conference , at which he calls \\tfor the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called `` Beasts of England '' . \\nWhen Old Major dies , two young pigs , Snowball and Napoleon , assume command and stage \\ta revolt , driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property `` Animal Farm '' . \\nThey adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism , the most important \\tof which is , `` All animals are equal '' . \\nThe decree is painted in large letters \\ton one side of the barn . \\nSnowball teaches the animals to read and write , while \\tNapoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism . \\nTo commemorate the start of Animal Farm , Snowball raises \\ta green flag with a white hoof and horn . \\nFood is plentiful , and \\tthe farm runs smoothly . \\nThe pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set \\taside special food items , ostensibly for their personal health . \\nFollowing an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm ( later dubbed the `` \\tBattle of the Cowshed '' ) , Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill . \\nNapoleon disputes this idea , and matters come to a head , which culminate \\tin Napoleon 's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander . \\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing \\tmeetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm . \\nThrough a young porker named Squealer , Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea \\t, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side . \\nThe animals work harder with the promise \\tof easier lives with the windmill . \\nWhen the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying \\tto sabotage their project , and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by Napoleon of consorting with his old rival . \\nWhen some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed , Napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he \\tis a collaborator of Mr. Jones , even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle . \\n`` Beasts of England '' is replaced with `` Animal Farm '' , while an anthem glorifying Napoleon , who \\tis presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man ( `` Comrade Napoleon '' ) , is composed and sung . \\nNapoleon then conducts a second purge , during which many animals who are alleged to be helping \\tSnowball in plots are executed by Napoleon 's dogs , which troubles the rest of the animals . \\nDespite their hardships , the animals are easily placated by Napoleon 's retort that they are better off than they were under \\tMr. Jones , as well as by the sheep 's continual bleating of `` four legs good , two legs bad '' . \\nMr. Frederick , a neighbouring farmer , attacks the farm \\t, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill . \\nAlthough the animals win the battle , they do so at great \\tcost , as many , including Boxer the workhorse , are wounded . \\nAlthough he recovers from this , Boxer eventually collapses while working on \\tthe windmill ( being almost 12 years old at that point ) . \\nHe is taken away in a knacker 's van and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this , but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by \\tpersuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner 's signboard had not been repainted . \\nSquealer subsequently reports Boxer 's death and honours \\thim with a festival the following day . \\n( However , Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker , \\tallowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves . ) \\nYears pass , the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is \\tconstructed , which makes the farm a good amount of income . \\nHowever , the ideals that Snowball discussed , including stalls with electric lighting , heating , and \\trunning water , are forgotten , with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives . \\nSnowball has been forgotten , alongside Boxer , with `` \\tthe exception of the few who knew him '' . \\nMany of the animals who participated in \\tthe rebellion are dead or old . \\nMr. Jones is also dead we learn , having `` died in \\tan inebriates ' home in another part of the country '' . \\nThe pigs start to resemble humans , as they walk upright \\t, carry whips , drink alcohol , and wear clothes . \\nThe Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase : `` All animals \\tare equal , but some animals are more equal than others '' . \\nThe maxim `` Four legs good , two legs bad '' is \\tsimilarly changed to `` Four legs good , two legs better '' . \\nOther changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner \\tand Old Major 's skull , which was previously put on display , being reburied . \\nNapoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local \\tfarmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance . \\nHe abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and \\trestores the name `` The Manor Farm '' . \\nThe men and pigs start playing cards , flattering \\tand praising each other while cheating at the game . \\nBoth Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington , one of the farmers , play the Ace of \\tSpades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first . \\nWhen the animals outside look at the pigs and men \\t, they can no longer distinguish between the two . \\nGenre and \\tstyle . \\nGeorge Orwell 's `` Animal Farm '' is an example of a political satire and an allegory that was \\tintended to have a `` wider application '' , according to Orwell himself , in terms of its relevance . \\nStylistically , the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell 's other works , most \\tnotably `` Nineteen Eighty-Four '' , as both have been considered works of Swiftian satire . \\nFurthermore , these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell 's bleak view of the future for humanity ; he seems \\tto stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in `` Animal Farm '' and `` Nineteen Eighty-Four '' . \\nIn these kinds of works , Orwell distinctly references the disarray \\tand traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War . \\nOrwell 's style and writing philosophy as a whole were \\tvery concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing . \\nOrwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward , given the \\tway that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse . \\nFor this reason , he is careful , in `` Animal Farm '' \\t, to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion . \\nThe difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact , as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly , \\twhile the wicked animals on the farm , such as Napoleon , twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires . \\nThis style reflects Orwell 's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at \\tthe time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin 's Soviet Russia . \\nBackground \\t. \\nOrigin and \\twriting . \\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944 after his experiences during the \\tSpanish Civil War , which he described in `` Homage to Catalonia '' ( 1938 ) . \\nIn the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of `` Animal Farm '' , he explained how escaping the communist purges \\tin Spain taught him `` how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries '' . \\nThis motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he \\tsaw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals . \\n`` Homage to Catalonia '' sold poorly ; after seeing Arthur Koestler 's best-selling , `` Darkness at Noon \\t'' , about the Moscow Trials , Orwell decided that fiction would be the best way to describe totalitarianism . \\nImmediately prior to writing the book \\t, Orwell had quit the BBC . \\nHe was also upset about a booklet for \\tpropagandists the Ministry of Information had put out . \\nThe booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union , \\tsuch as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination . \\nIn the preface , Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm : \\tIn 1944 , the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London home . \\nOrwell spent hours sifting through the \\trubble to find the pages intact . \\nPublication \\t. \\nPublishing \\t. \\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book \\tmight upset the alliance between Britain , the United States , and the Soviet Union . \\nFour publishers refused to publish `` Animal Farm '' , yet one had initially \\taccepted the work , but declined it after consulting the Ministry of Information . \\nEventually , Secker and Warburg published \\tthe first edition in 1945 . \\nDuring the Second World War , it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was \\tnot something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher Gollancz . \\nHe also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber , where the poet T. S. Eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book 's \\t`` good writing '' and `` fundamental integrity '' , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint `` which I take to be generally Trotskyite '' . \\nEliot said he found the view `` not convincing '' , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to \\trun the farm ; he posited that someone might argue `` what was needed ... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs '' . \\nOrwell let André Deutsch , who was working for Nicholson & amp ; Watson in 1944 , read the typescript , and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & amp ; \\tWatson would want to publish it ; however , they did not , and `` lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in `` Animal Farm '' '' . \\nIn his `` London Letter '' on 17 April 1944 for `` Partisan Review '' , Orwell \\twrote that it was `` now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed . \\nAnti-Russian books do appear , but mostly from Catholic publishing firms \\tand always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle '' . \\nThe publisher Jonathan Cape , who had initially accepted `` Animal Farm '' , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry \\tof Information warned him off – although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy . \\nWriting to Leonard Moore , a partner in the literary agency of Christy & amp ; Moore , publisher Jonathan \\tCape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information . \\nSuch flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable , and the choice of \\tpigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive . \\nIt may reasonably be assumed that the `` important official '' was a \\tman named Peter Smollett , who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent . \\nOrwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka , and he would be one of the names Orwell included \\tin his list of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949 . \\nThe publisher wrote to Orwell , saying : Frederic Warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela \\t, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the Red Army , which had played a major part in defeating Adolf Hitler . \\nA Russian translation was printed in the paper `` Posev '' , and in giving permission \\tfor a Russian translation of `` Animal Farm '' , Orwell refused in advance all royalties . \\nA translation in Ukrainian , which was produced in Germany , was confiscated in large \\tpart by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission . \\nIn October 1945 , Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the \\tpossibility that the political cartoonist David Low might illustrate `` Animal Farm '' . \\nLow had written a letter saying that he had had `` a good time with `` \\tAnimal Farm '' – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly '' . \\nNothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by Secker \\t& amp ; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned . \\nThe Folio Society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by Quentin Blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published \\tby Secker & amp ; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of `` Animal Farm '' . \\nPreface \\t. \\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR , their World War II ally : Although \\tthe first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it . \\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of `` \\tAnimal Farm '' in 1945 , without an introduction . \\nHowever , the publisher had provided space for a preface \\tin the author 's proof composited from the manuscript . \\nFor reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the \\tpage numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute . \\nIn 1972 , Ian Angus found the original typescript titled `` The Freedom of the Press '' , and Bernard Crick published it , together with \\this own introduction , in `` The Times Literary Supplement '' on 15 September 1972 as `` How the essay came to be written '' . \\nOrwell 's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press , specifically \\tthe suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government . \\nThe same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of `` Animal Farm '' \\twith another introduction by Crick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface . \\nOther publishers were still \\tdeclining to publish it . \\nReception \\t. \\nContemporary reviews of the work \\twere not universally positive . \\nWriting in the American `` New Republic '' magazine , George Soule expressed his \\tdisappointment in the book , writing that it `` puzzled and saddened me . \\nIt seemed on \\tthe whole dull . \\nThe allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in \\ta clumsy way things that have been said better directly '' . \\nSoule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations , and said , `` It seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous \\tsuccess ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well '' . \\n`` The Guardian '' on 24 August 1945 called `` Animal Farm '' `` a \\tdelightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few '' . \\nTosco Fyvel , writing in `` Tribune '' on the same day , called the book `` a gentle \\tsatire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us '' . \\nJulian Symons responded , on 7 September , `` Should we not expect , in `` Tribune '' at least , \\tacknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State – Soviet Russia ? \\nIt seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin , and Snowball \\twith Trotsky , and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author , upon a political ground . \\nIn a hundred years time perhaps , `` Animal Farm '' may be simply a fairy \\tstory ; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point '' . \\n`` Animal Farm '' has been subject to much \\tcomment in the decades since these early remarks . \\nBetween 1952 and 1957 , the CIA , in an operation codenamed Aedinosaur , sent millions of balloons carrying copies \\tof the novel into Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down . \\n`` Time '' magazine chose `` Animal Farm '' as one of the 100 best English-language novels ( 1923 \\tto 2005 ) ; it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels . \\nIt won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is \\tincluded in the Great Books of the Western World selection . \\nPopular reading in schools , `` Animal Farm '' was ranked \\tthe UK 's favourite book from school in a 2016 poll . \\n`` Animal Farm '' has also faced an array \\tof challenges in school settings around the US . \\nThe following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell 's work : \\t'' Animal Farm '' has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries . \\nThe ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow , Russia , in 1977 and \\tbanned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs , such as pigs or alcohol . \\nIn the same manner , `` Animal Farm '' \\thas also faced relatively recent issues in China . \\nIn 2018 , the government made the decision to censor all \\tonline posts about or referring to `` Animal Farm '' . \\nHowever the book itself , as of \\t2019 , remains sold in stores . \\nAmy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom of `` The Atlantic '' stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in Mainland China for several reasons : censors believe the general public is unlikely to read \\ta highbrow book , because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway , and because the Communist Party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability . \\nThe authors stated `` It was – and remains – as easy to buy `` 1984 '' and \\t`` Animal Farm '' in Shenzhen or Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles '' . \\nAn enhanced version of the book , launched in India in 2017 , was widely praised for capturing the author 's \\tintent , by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition . \\nAnalysis \\t. \\nAnimalism \\t. \\nThe pigs Snowball , Napoleon , and Squealer adapt Old Major 's ideas into `` a complete system of thought '' \\t, which they formally name Animalism , an allegoric reference to Communism , not to be confused with the philosophy Animalism . \\nSoon after , Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol \\t, sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments . \\nSquealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation , an allusion to the Soviet government \\t's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people 's beliefs about themselves and their society . \\nThe original commandments are : These commandments are also distilled into \\tthe maxim `` Four legs good , two legs bad ! '' \\nwhich is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often \\tto disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism . \\nLater , Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some \\tcommandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking . \\nThe changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded : Eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , `` All animals are equal , \\tbut some animals are more equal than others '' , and `` Four legs good , two legs better '' as the pigs become more anthropomorphic . \\nThis is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments , which were supposed to keep order within \\tAnimal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans ' evil habits . \\nThrough the revision of the commandments , Orwell demonstrates how \\tsimply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda . \\nSignificance and \\tallegory . \\nOrwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written , `` virtually \\tevery detail has political significance in this allegory '' . \\nOrwell himself wrote in 1946 , `` Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution ... [ and ] `` that kind '' of revolution ( violent \\tconspiratorial revolution , led by unconsciously power-hungry people ) can only lead to a change of masters [ – ] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert '' . \\nIn a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition , he stated , `` for the past ten years I have \\tbeen convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement . \\nOn my return from Spain [ in 1937 ] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story \\tthat could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages '' . \\nThe revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is \\tOrwell 's analogy with the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution . \\nThe `` Battle of the Cowshed '' has been said to represent the allied invasion of Soviet \\tRussia in 1918 , and the defeat of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War . \\nThe pigs ' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR \\t, just as Napoleon 's emergence as the farm 's sole leader reflects Stalin 's emergence . \\nThe pigs ' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use , `` the turning point of the story '' as Orwell termed it in a letter to Dwight Macdonald , stands \\tas an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 Kronstadt revolt against the Bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various Five Year Plans . \\nThe puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure , and the pigs \\t' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s . \\nIn chapter seven , when the animals confess their non-existent crimes and are killed , \\tOrwell directly alludes to the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s . \\nThese contributed to Orwell 's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution \\thad been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten . \\nPeter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Davison contend that the `` Battle of the Windmill '' , \\tspecifically referencing the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow , represents World War II . \\nDuring the battle , Orwell first wrote , `` \\tAll the animals , including Napoleon '' took cover . \\nOrwell had the publisher alter this to `` All the animals except Napoleon '' \\tin recognition of Stalin 's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance . \\nOrwell requested the change after he met \\tJózef Czapski in Paris in March 1945 . \\nCzapski , a survivor of the Katyn Massacre and an opponent of the Soviet regime , told Orwell , as Orwell wrote to Arthur \\tKoestler , that it had been `` the character [ and ] greatness of Stalin '' that saved Russia from the German invasion . \\nOther connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell 's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness \\tthat ran through the countryside after the Rebellion , which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and in Germany ( Ch . \\nIV ) ; the conflict between \\tNapoleon and Snowball ( Ch . \\nV ) , parallelling `` the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another : Trotskyism , with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the \\tproletariat of the West ; and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia 's socialist destiny '' ; Napoleon 's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets ( Ch . \\nVI ) , paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo ; and Frederick 's forged bank notes , parallelling the \\tHitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 , after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill . \\nThe book 's close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement , reflected Orwell 's view of the 1943 Tehran Conference that seemed to display the \\testablishment of `` the best possible relations between the USSR and the West '' – but in reality were destined , as Orwell presciently predicted , to continue to unravel . \\nThe disagreement between the allies and the start of the Cold War is suggested when Napoleon \\tand Pilkington , both suspicious , each `` played an ace of spades simultaneously '' . \\nSimilarly , the music in the novel , starting with `` Beasts of England '' and the later anthems , parallels `` The \\tInternationale '' and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s . \\nAdaptations \\t. \\nStage \\tproductions . \\nIn 2021 , during pandemic restrictions , the National Youth Theatre toured a stage version of \\t`` Animal Farm ; '' this run included outdoor performances on a farm at Soulton Hall . \\nA solo version , adapted and performed by Guy Masterson , premiered at \\tthe Traverse Theatre Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since . \\nA theatrical version , with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell , was \\tstaged at the National Theatre London on 25 April 1984 , directed by Peter Hall . \\nIt toured nine \\tcities in 1985 . \\nA new adaptation written and directed by Robert Icke , designed by Bunny Christie with puppetry designed and \\tdirected by Toby Olié opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 2022 before touring the UK . \\nFilms \\t. \\n`` Animal Farm '' has \\tbeen adapted to film twice . \\nBoth differ from the novel and have been accused \\tof taking significant liberties , including sanitising some aspects . \\nAndy Serkis is directing an upcoming animated \\tfilm adaptation with Matt Reeves producing . \\nRadio \\tdramatisations . \\nA BBC radio version , produced by Rayner \\tHeppenstall , was broadcast in January 1947 . \\nOrwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square \\t, London , with Hugh Gordon Porteous , amongst others . \\nOrwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous , `` who had not read \\tthe book , grasped what was happening after a few minutes '' . \\nA further radio production , again using Orwell 's own dramatisation of \\tthe book , was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC Radio 4 . \\nTamsin Greig narrated , and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon , \\tToby Jones as the propagandist Squealer , and Ralph Ineson as Boxer . \\nComic \\tstrip . \\nIn 1950 , Norman Pett and his writing partner Don Freeman were secretly hired by the Information Research Department ( IRD \\t) , a secret wing of the British Foreign Office , to adapt `` Animal Farm '' into a comic strip . \\nThis comic was not published in the UK \\tbut ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers . \\n\""

       "\"Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with \\tstateless societies or other forms of free associations . \\nAs a historically left-wing movement , usually placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum , it is \\tusually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing ( libertarian socialism ) of the socialist movement . \\nHumans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the \\testablishment of formal states , realms , or empires . \\nWith the rise of organised hierarchical bodies \\t, scepticism toward authority also rose . \\nAlthough traces of anarchist thought are found throughout \\thistory , modern anarchism emerged from the Enlightenment . \\nDuring the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement \\tflourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers ' struggles for emancipation . \\nVarious anarchist schools of thought \\tformed during this period . \\nAnarchists have taken part in several revolutions , most notably in the Paris Commune , the Russian Civil \\tWar and the Spanish Civil War , whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism . \\nIn the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century , the anarchist movement has \\tbeen resurgent once more , growing in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist , anti-war and anti-globalisation movements . \\nAnarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated \\tinto revolutionary and evolutionary tactics ; there is significant overlap between the two , which are merely descriptive . \\nRevolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , having taken a violent turn in \\tthe past , while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like . \\nAnarchist thought , criticism , and praxis have played \\ta part in diverse areas of human society . \\nEtymology , terminology \\t, and definition . \\nThe etymological origin of `` anarchism '' is from the Ancient Greek `` anarkhia '' , meaning `` without a ruler '' , composed of \\tthe prefix `` an- '' ( `` without '' ) and the word `` arkhos '' ( `` leader '' or `` ruler '' ) . \\nThe suffix `` -ism '' denotes \\tthe ideological current that favours anarchy . \\n`` Anarchism '' appears in English from 1642 as `` anarchisme '' and `` \\tanarchy '' from 1539 ; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder . \\nVarious factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as `` anarchists \\t'' , although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists . \\nMany revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin ( 1756–1836 ) and Wilhelm Weitling ( 1808–1871 ) would contribute to the \\tanarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use `` anarchist '' or `` anarchism '' in describing themselves or their beliefs . \\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an `` anarchist '' ( ) was Pierre-Joseph \\tProudhon ( 1809–1865 ) , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century . \\nSince the 1890s and beginning in France , `` libertarianism '' has often been used as a \\tsynonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States . \\nSome usages of `` libertarianism '' refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only \\t, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed `` libertarian anarchism '' . \\nWhile the term `` libertarian '' has been largely synonymous with anarchism , its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups , including both the \\tNew Left and libertarian Marxists , who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party , and extreme cultural liberals , who are primarily concerned with civil liberties . \\nAdditionally , some anarchists use `` libertarian socialist '' to avoid \\tanarchism 's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism . \\n`` Anarchism '' is broadly used to describe \\tthe anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement . \\nAnarchism is contrasted to socialist forms \\twhich are state-oriented or from above . \\nScholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism 's socialist credentials \\tand criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two . \\nSome scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism , and being both liberals and \\tsocialists but more so , while most scholars reject anarcho-capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles . \\nWhile opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought , defining `` anarchism '' is not an easy task for scholars , \\tas there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter , and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently . \\nMajor definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society , the rejection of the state apparatus , the belief that human nature allows humans \\tto exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society , and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPre-modern \\tera . \\nBefore the creation of towns and cities \\t, established authority did not exist . \\nIt was after the institution of authority that \\tanarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction . \\nThe most notable precursors to anarchism in the \\tancient world were in China and Greece . \\nIn China , philosophical anarchism ( the discussion on the legitimacy of \\tthe state ) was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuang Zhou and Laozi . \\nAlongside Stoicism , Taoism has been said to \\thave had `` significant anticipations '' of anarchism . \\nAnarchic attitudes were also articulated by \\ttragedians and philosophers in Greece . \\nAeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the \\tconflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy . \\nSocrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on \\tthe right of individual freedom of conscience . \\nCynics dismissed human law ( `` nomos '' ) and associated authorities \\twhile trying to live according to nature ( `` physis '' ) . \\nStoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly \\trelations among its citizens without the presence of a state . \\nIn medieval Europe , there was no \\tanarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements . \\nThese , and other Muslim movements , \\tlater gave birth to religious anarchism . \\nIn the Sasanian Empire , Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the \\tabolition of monarchy , only to be soon executed by Emperor Kavad I . \\nIn Basra , religious sects \\tpreached against the state . \\nIn Europe , various sects \\tdeveloped anti-state and libertarian tendencies . \\nRenewed interest in antiquity during the Renaissance and in private judgment during \\tthe Reformation restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism , particularly in France . \\nEnlightenment challenges to intellectual authority ( secular and religious ) and the revolutions of the 1790s \\tand 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism . \\nModern \\tera . \\nDuring the French Revolution , partisan groups such as the Enragés and the \\tsaw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments . \\nThe first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England , morally delegitimising the state \\t, Max Stirner 's thinking paved the way to individualism and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon 's theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France . \\nBy the late 1870s , various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined \\tand a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914 . \\nThis era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the \\tSpanish Civil War and is considered the golden age of anarchism . \\nDrawing from mutualism , Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen 's Association , a \\tclass worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents . \\nThe International became a significant political force , with Karl Marx \\tbeing a leading figure and a member of its General Council . \\nBakunin 's faction ( the Jura Federation ) and Proudhon 's followers ( the \\tmutualists ) opposed state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . \\nAfter bitter disputes , the Bakuninists were expelled from the \\tInternational by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress . \\nAnarchists were treated similarly in the Second \\tInternational , being ultimately expelled in 1896 . \\nBakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx 's \\tterms , they would end up the new tyrants of workers . \\nIn response to their expulsion from the First \\tInternational , anarchists formed the St. Imier International . \\nUnder the influence of Peter Kropotkin , a Russian \\tphilosopher and scientist , anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism . \\nAnarcho-communists , who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune , advocated for \\tfree federation and for the distribution of goods according to one 's needs . \\nAt the turn of the century , \\tanarchism had spread all over the world . \\nIt was a notable feature \\tof the international syndicalism movement . \\nIn China , small groups of students \\timported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism . \\nTokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the \\tfar east , travelling to the Japanese capital to study . \\nIn Latin America , Argentina was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism \\t, where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology . \\nDuring this time , a minority of \\tanarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence . \\nThis strategy became known as \\tpropaganda of the deed . \\nThe dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many \\tCommunards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts . \\nEven though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts , infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made \\tto exclude them from American immigration , including the Immigration Act of 1903 , also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act . \\nIllegalism was another strategy which some \\tanarchists adopted during this period . \\nDespite concerns , anarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution in opposition to the White \\tmovement ; however , they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilised . \\nSeveral anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine , \\tnotably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and the Makhnovist movement . \\nWith the anarchists being crushed in Russia , two new \\tantithetical currents emerged , namely platformism and synthesis anarchism . \\nThe former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution \\twhile the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party . \\nSeeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War , many \\tworkers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . \\nIn France and the United States , members of major syndicalist movements such as the General Confederation \\tof Labour and the Industrial Workers of the World left their organisations and joined the Communist International . \\nIn the Spanish Civil War of 1936 , anarchists and syndicalists ( CNT \\tand FAI ) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists . \\nA long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to \\tanarchists playing a pivotal role in the war . \\nIn response to the army rebellion , an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias \\t, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain , where they collectivised the land . \\nThe Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war , but the result was a bitter fight among \\tcommunists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans . \\nPost-war \\tera . \\nBy the end of World War II , \\tthe anarchist movement had been severely weakened . \\nThe 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism , likely caused by a \\tperceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War . \\nDuring this time , anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as \\tthe anti-nuclear , environmental , and peace movements , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the New Left . \\nIt also saw a transition from its \\tprevious revolutionary nature to provocative anti-capitalist reformism . \\nAnarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by \\tbands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols . \\nThe established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with \\tvigour during the second wave of feminism . \\nBlack anarchism began to take form at this time \\tand influenced anarchism 's move from a Eurocentric demographic . \\nThis coincided with its failure to gain traction in \\tNorthern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America . \\nAround the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in \\tpopularity and influence within anti-capitalist , anti-war and anti-globalisation movements . \\nAnarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization \\t( WTO ) , the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum . \\nDuring the protests , `` ad hoc '' leaderless anonymous cadres known as black \\tblocs engaged in rioting , property destruction and violent confrontations with the police . \\nOther organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups , security \\tculture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet . \\nA significant event of this period was the \\tconfrontations at the 1999 Seattle WTO conference . \\nAnarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern \\tSyria , more commonly known as Rojava , a `` de facto '' autonomous region in northern Syria . \\nWhile having revolutionary aspirations , many forms \\tof anarchism are not confrontational nowadays . \\nInstead , they are trying to build an alternative way of \\tsocial organization , based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation . \\nScholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of Food not Bombs group of collectives , to highlight some features \\tof how anarchist groups work : direct action , working together and in solidarity with those left behind . \\nWhile doing so , they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policies to tackle hunger , raging \\tfrom de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents , helping farmers and commodification of food and housing . \\nHoneywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not \\tonly of humans , but non-humans and the environment as well . \\nHoneywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only can not solve those pressing \\tproblems for humanity , but are causal factors as well , resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole . \\nThought \\t. \\nAnarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions , social \\tanarchism and individualist anarchism , owing to their different origins , values and evolution . \\nThe individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual , while the social current \\temphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership . \\nIn a chronological sense , anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th \\tcentury and the post-classical currents ( anarcha-feminism , green anarchism , and post-anarchism ) developed thereafter . \\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that \\tthe state lacks moral legitimacy , without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it . \\nA component especially of individualist anarchism , philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state \\tbut claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy . \\nAnarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since \\tethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy . \\nAnarchism 's emphasis on anti-capitalism , egalitarianism , and for the extension of community \\tand individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism . \\nAnarchism is usually placed on the \\tfar-left of the political spectrum . \\nMuch of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian , anti-statist , libertarian , and radical interpretations of left-wing and socialist \\tpolitics such as collectivism , communism , individualism , mutualism , and syndicalism , among other libertarian socialist economic theories . \\nAs anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular \\tworldview , many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely . \\nOne reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives , a call for toleration and unity among anarchists \\tfirst adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time . \\nBelief in political nihilism has \\tbeen espoused by anarchists . \\nDespite separation , the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through \\ta set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy , mutual aid , network organisation , communal democracy , justified authority and decentralisation . \\nClassical \\t. \\nInceptive currents among classical anarchist \\tcurrents were mutualism and individualism . \\nThey were followed by the major currents of social \\tanarchism ( collectivist , communist and syndicalist ) . \\nThey differ on organisational and economic \\taspects of their ideal society . \\nMutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was \\tdeveloped into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . \\nIts aims include reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation and monetary reform \\tof both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people . \\nMutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated \\tbetween individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism . \\nIn `` What \\tIs Property ? '' \\n( 1840 ) , Proudhon first characterised his goal as a `` \\tthird form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . '' \\nCollectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form \\tof anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin . \\nCollectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and \\tthat workers be paid according to time worked , rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism . \\nCollectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the \\tproletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society . \\nAnarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations , workers \\t' councils and worker cooperatives , with production and consumption based on the guiding principle `` From each according to his ability , to each according to his need . '' \\nAnarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was \\tfirst formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International . \\nIt was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin , whose specific \\tstyle would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century . \\nAnarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary \\tsocial change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers . \\nThe basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are direct action \\t, workers ' solidarity and workers ' self-management . \\nIndividualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement \\tthat emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants . \\nEarly influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William \\tGodwin , Max Stirner , and Henry David Thoreau . \\nThrough many countries , individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and \\tintellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation . \\nPost-classical and \\tcontemporary . \\nAnarchist principles undergird contemporary radical \\tsocial movements of the left . \\nInterest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation \\tmovement , whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation . \\nAs the movement shaped 21st century radicalism , wider \\tembrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest . \\nAnarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , \\tdrawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches . \\nThe anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism \\thas remained prominent within contemporary currents . \\nContemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has \\treinforced anarchism 's historical association with chaos and violence . \\nIts publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to \\tengage with the anarchist movement , although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory . \\nVarious anarchist groups , tendencies , and schools of thought exist \\ttoday , making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement . \\nWhile theorists and activists have established `` relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles '' , there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple `` \\tanarchisms '' , rather than a singular `` anarchism '' , in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently . \\nGender equality can be a common principle , although it \\tranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists . \\nAnarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms , namely `` all centralized and \\thierarchical forms of government ( e.g. , monarchy , representative democracy , state socialism , etc . \\n) , economic class systems ( e.g. , capitalism \\t, Bolshevism , feudalism , slavery , etc . \\n) , autocratic religions ( e.g. , \\tfundamentalist Islam , Roman Catholicism , etc . \\n) , patriarchy , heterosexism , \\twhite supremacy , and imperialism . '' \\nAnarchist schools disagree on the methods by \\twhich these forms should be opposed . \\nThe principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics \\tin that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions . \\nThis entails that liberty and equality can not be implemented within the state \\t, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy . \\nTactics \\t. \\nAnarchists ' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals , namely to first oppose the Establishment and \\tsecondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society , illustrating the unity of means and ends . \\nA broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary \\tmeans on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other . \\nEvolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence , reject violence and take a gradual approach \\tto anarchist aims , although there is significant overlap between the two . \\nAnarchist tactics have shifted during the \\tcourse of the last century . \\nAnarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and \\tmilitancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches . \\nClassical \\tera . \\nDuring the classical era , \\tanarchists had a militant tendency . \\nNot only did they confront state armed forces , as in Spain and Ukraine \\t, but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed . \\nAssassination attempts were carried out against heads of \\tstate , some of which were successful . \\nAnarchists also took \\tpart in revolutions . \\nMany anarchists , especially the Galleanists , believed that these attempts would \\tbe the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state . \\nMany of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late \\t1870s , the early 1880s and the 1890s , with some still occurring in the early 1900s . \\nTheir decrease in prevalence was the result of further \\tjudicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions . \\nAnarchist perspectives towards violence \\thave always been controversial . \\nAnarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to \\tachieve their stateless , nonviolent ends . \\nOther anarchist groups advocate direct action , a tactic \\twhich can include acts of sabotage or terrorism . \\nThis attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and \\tsome anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible . \\nEmma Goldman and Errico Malatesta , who were proponents of limited use of violence , \\tstated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil . \\nAnarchists took an active role in strike actions , although they tended \\tto be antipathetic to formal syndicalism , seeing it as reformist . \\nThey saw it as a part of the movement \\twhich sought to overthrow the state and capitalism . \\nAnarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts \\t, some of whom practiced naturism and nudism . \\nThose anarchists also built communities which were based on \\tfriendship and were involved in the news media . \\nRevolutionary \\t. \\nIn the current era , Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno , a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism , has reinstated the debate \\ton violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards . \\nBoth Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small , informal affiliation groups , where each member is responsible for their \\town actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state , capitalism , and other enemies . \\nMembers of The Invisible Committee were arrested in \\t2008 on various charges , terrorism included . \\nOverall , contemporary anarchists are much less \\tviolent and militant than their ideological ancestors . \\nThey mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots , \\tespecially in countries such as Canada , Greece , and Mexico . \\nMilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police ; however , anarchists not only clash with state operators , \\tthey also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists , taking anti-fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening . \\nEvolutionary \\t. \\nAnarchists commonly employ \\tdirect action . \\nThis can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy , or the form \\tof self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives . \\nDecision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way , with everyone having \\tequal say in each decision , an approach known as horizontalism . \\nContemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism , \\talthough not explicitly anarchist , respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations . \\nIn contrast with the `` big-A anarchism '' of the classical era , the newly coined term `` small-a anarchism '' signals their tendency not to \\tbase their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions . \\nThose anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis \\ton their own experience which they will later theorize . \\nThe decision-making process of small anarchist affinity \\tgroups plays a significant tactical role . \\nAnarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members \\tof their group without the need of a leader or a leading group . \\nOne way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to \\thelp achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point . \\nMinorities usually accept rough consensus , except when they feel \\tthe proposal contradicts anarchist ethics , goals and values . \\nAnarchists usually form small groups ( 5–20 individuals ) \\tto enhance autonomy and friendships among their members . \\nThese kinds of groups more often than not \\tinterconnect with each other , forming larger networks . \\nAnarchists still support and participate in strikes , especially wildcat strikes \\tas these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate . \\nAs in the past , newspapers and journals are used , and anarchists \\thave gone online in the World Wide Web to spread their message . \\nAnarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional \\tand other difficulties , hosting electronic libraries and other portals . \\nAnarchists were also involved in developing various \\tsoftware that are available for free . \\nThe way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals \\t, especially when it comes to preserving users ' privacy from state surveillance . \\nAnarchists organize themselves to squat \\tand reclaim public spaces . \\nDuring important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied , they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones \\t( TAZ ) , spaces where art , poetry , and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal . \\nAs seen by anarchists , squatting is a way to regain urban space from \\tthe capitalist market , serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action . \\nAcquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with \\ttheir ideas and build social bonds . \\nAdding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them , along with \\tvarious forms of protesting at highly symbolic events , make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity . \\nKey \\tissues . \\nAs anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies , and schools \\tof thought ; disagreement over questions of values , ideology , and tactics is common . \\nIts diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different \\tanarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory . \\nThe compatibility of capitalism , nationalism , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed , and anarchism \\tenjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism , collectivism , Marxism , and trade unionism . \\nAnarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened \\tself-interest , veganism , or any number of alternative ethical doctrines . \\nPhenomena such as civilisation \\t, technology ( e.g . \\nwithin anarcho-primitivism ) , and the democratic process may be sharply \\tcriticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others . \\nThe \\tstate . \\nObjection to the state and its institutions is \\ta `` sine qua non '' of anarchism . \\nAnarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and \\tbelieve it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies . \\nInstead of people being able to control the aspects of their \\tlife , major decisions are taken by a small elite . \\nAuthority ultimately rests solely on power , regardless of whether that power is \\topen or transparent , as it still has the ability to coerce people . \\nAnother anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government , even the most \\taltruistic among officials , will unavoidably seek to gain more power , leading to corruption . \\nAnarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an \\tunachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society . \\nSpecific anarchist attitudes towards \\tthe state vary . \\nRobert Paul Wolff believed that the tension between authority and \\tautonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate . \\nBakunin saw the state as meaning `` coercion , domination by means of \\tcoercion , camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be . '' \\nA. John Simmons and Leslie Green , who leaned toward philosophical anarchism , believed that the state \\tcould be legitimate if it is governed by consensus , although they saw this as highly unlikely . \\nBeliefs on how to abolish \\tthe state also differ . \\nGender , sexuality , \\tand free love . \\nAs gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy , many anarchists address , \\tanalyse , and oppose the suppression of one 's autonomy imposed by gender roles . \\nSexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that \\tdid felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing . \\nSexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker , who \\topposed age of consent laws , believing they would benefit predatory men . \\nA historical current that arose and flourished during \\t1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love . \\nIn contemporary anarchism , this current survives as \\ta tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism . \\nFree love advocates were against marriage , which they saw as a way of men \\timposing authority over women , largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men . \\nThe notion of free love was much broader and included a critique \\tof the established order that limited women 's sexual freedom and pleasure . \\nThose free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses , where \\tlarge groups of travelers , anarchists and other activists slept in beds together . \\nFree love had roots both in Europe and the United States ; however \\t, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love . \\nAnarchist feminists were advocates of free love , against marriage , and pro-choice \\t( utilising a contemporary term ) , and had a similar agenda . \\nAnarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage \\tbut were supportive of one another . \\nDuring the second half of the 20th century , anarchism intermingled with the second wave \\tof feminism , radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well . \\nBy the latest decades of the 20th century , anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women \\t, gays , queers and other marginalised groups , with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents . \\nWith the third wave of feminism , sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a \\tsubject of study for anarchists , yielding a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality . \\nSome anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking , suggesting that it \\tleaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation . \\nEducation \\t. \\nThe interest of anarchists in education stretches back \\tto the first emergence of classical anarchism . \\nAnarchists consider proper education , one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy \\tof the individual and the society , to be an act of mutual aid . \\nAnarchist writers such as William Godwin ( `` Political Justice '' ) and Max Stirner ( `` The False Principle of Our \\tEducation '' ) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges . \\nIn 1901 , Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela Moderna in Barcelona \\tas an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church . \\nFerrer 's approach was secular , rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational \\tprocess whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance . \\nFerrer aimed to educate the working class and \\texplicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students . \\nThe school closed after constant harassment by \\tthe state and Ferrer was later arrested . \\nNonetheless , his ideas formed the inspiration for \\ta series of modern schools around the world . \\nChristian anarchist Leo Tolstoy , who published the essay `` Education and Culture '' , also established a similar \\tschool with its founding principle being that `` for education to be effective it had to be free . '' \\nIn a similar token , A. S. Neill founded what became the \\tSummerhill School in 1921 , also declaring being free from coercion . \\nAnarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child 's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that \\trationality would lead children to morally good conclusions ; however , there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation . \\nFerrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality , liberty and \\tsocial justice were not possible under capitalism , along with other critiques of government and nationalism . \\nLate 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ( Paul Goodman , Herbert Read , and Colin Ward ) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education , largely focusing on \\tthe need for a system that focuses on children 's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society . \\nContemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that \\tstate education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality . \\nWhile few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day , major tenets of anarchist schools , among them respect for \\tchild autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method , have spread among mainstream educational institutions . \\nJudith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools , namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part \\tof a wider American-Canadian network of schools , the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton , England , and the Paideia School in Spain . \\nThe \\tarts . \\nThe connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism , especially \\tamong artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists , surrealists and others . \\nIn literature , anarchism was mostly associated with \\tthe New Apocalyptics and the neo-romanticism movement . \\nIn music , anarchism has been associated \\twith music scenes such as punk . \\nAnarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist , what separates art from \\ta daily act , is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life . \\nOther anarchists advocated for or used art \\tas a means to achieve anarchist ends . \\nIn his book `` Breaking the Spell : A History of Anarchist Filmmakers , Videotape Guerrillas , and \\tDigital Ninjas '' , Chris Robé claims that `` anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism . '' \\nThroughout the 20th century , many prominent anarchists ( Peter Kropotkin , Emma Goldman , Gustav Landauer and \\tCamillo Berneri ) and publications such as `` Anarchy '' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts . \\nThree overlapping properties made \\tart useful to anarchists . \\nIt could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies , serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect \\tthe anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests . \\nAs it appeals to both emotion and reason , art could \\tappeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect . \\nThe 19th-century neo-impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an \\texample of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism . \\nIn `` Les chataigniers a Osny '' by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro , the \\tblending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nThe most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans can \\tnot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival . \\nPhilosopher Bertrand Russell supported this critique , stating that `` [ p ] eace and war , tariffs , regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs , the \\tpreservation of a just system of distribution : these , among others , are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government . '' \\nAnother common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small \\tenough entities can be self-governing ; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism . \\nPhilosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to \\tviolence and destruction , not only in the pragmatic world , such as at protests , but in the world of ethics as well . \\nSecondly , anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian \\tsince the state can not be defeated practically . \\nThis line of arguments most often calls for \\tpolitical action within the system to reform it . \\nThe third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as \\ta ruling theory that has no ruling theory . \\nAnarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of \\tthe individual , hence no collective action can be taken . \\nLastly , Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective ( all \\ttalk and thoughts ) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong . \\nPhilosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist \\tbooks such as A. John Simmons ' `` Moral Principles and Political Obligations '' . \\nLaw professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue \\tagainst three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious . \\nEdmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience , this \\tdoes not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate . \\nIn `` The Problem of Political Authority '' , Michael Huemer defends philosophical \\tanarchism , claiming that `` political authority is a moral illusion . '' \\nOne of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies \\tand fails to understand the biological inclination to authority . \\nJoseph Raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the \\tbelief that following their instructions will afford more success . \\nRaz believes that this argument is true in \\tfollowing both authorities ' successful and mistaken instruction . \\nAnarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging \\tauthority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable , nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment . \\nAnarchist perception of human nature , rejection of the state , and commitment to social revolution \\thas been criticised by academics as naive , overly simplistic , and unrealistic , respectively . \\nClassical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief \\tthat the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering . \\nFriedrich Engels , considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism , criticised anarchism \\t's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian . \\nAcademic John Molyneux writes in his book `` Anarchism : A Marxist Criticism '' that `` anarchism \\tcan not win '' , believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas . \\nThe Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian \\tcharacter because all individuals should have anarchist views and values . \\nAccording to the Marxist view , that a social idea would follow directly from this \\thuman ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence . \\nMarxists state that this contradiction was \\tresponsible for their inability to act . \\nIn the anarchist vision , the conflict between liberty \\tand equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 13 ''

AlbaniaEconomy < /doc > < doc id= '' 39 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=39 '' title= '' Albedo '' > Albedo Albedo ( ; ) is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0 , corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation , to 1 , corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation . \\nSurface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity `` J '' e to the \\tirradiance `` E '' e ( flux per unit area ) received by a surface . \\nThe proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself , but \\talso by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface . \\nThese factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location , \\tand time ( see position of the Sun ) . \\nWhile bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( i.e. , for a given position of \\tthe Sun ) , albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period . \\nThe temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from \\tflux measurements ) to daily , monthly , or annual averages . \\nUnless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ) \\t, albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation . \\nDue to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which \\tmost solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0.3 and 3 μm ) . \\nThis spectrum includes visible light ( 0.4–0.7 μm ) , which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( e.g. , \\ttrees absorb most radiation ) , whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( e.g. , snow reflects most radiation ) . \\nAlbedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( e.g. , as part \\tof the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ) . \\nThe average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere , its `` planetary albedo '' , is 30–35 % \\tbecause of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features . \\nThe term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann \\tHeinrich Lambert in his 1760 work `` Photometria '' . \\nTerrestrial \\talbedo . \\nAny albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for \\tfresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances . \\nDeeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo \\tapproaching the zero of a black body . \\nWhen seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as \\tdo most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms . \\nMost land areas are in an \\talbedo range of 0.1 to 0.4 . \\nThe average albedo of \\tEarth is about 0.3 . \\nThis is far higher than for the ocean \\tprimarily because of the contribution of clouds . \\nEarth 's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA 's MODIS instruments \\ton board the Terra and Aqua satellites , and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS . \\nAs the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite , not all directions , a mathematical model \\tis used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance ( e.g. , ) . \\nThese calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( BRDF ) , which describes how the \\treflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle . \\nBDRF can facilitate translations of \\tobservations of reflectance into albedo . \\nEarth 's average surface temperature due to its \\talbedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about . \\nIf Earth were frozen entirely ( and hence be more reflective \\t) , the average temperature of the planet would drop below . \\nIf only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , \\tthe mean temperature of the planet would drop to about . \\nIn contrast , if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called \\tocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost . \\nIn 2021 , scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5 % over two \\tdecades ( 1998–2017 ) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques . \\nThis may have both been co-caused by climate change \\tas well as a substantial increase in global warming . \\nHowever , the link to climate change has not been explored to date \\tand it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend . \\nWhite-sky , black-sky , \\tand blue-sky albedo . \\nFor land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle `` θ '' '' i '' can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and formula_4 \\tbeing the proportion of diffuse illumination , the actual albedo formula_5 ( also called blue-sky albedo ) can then be given as : This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface . \\nExamples of terrestrial \\talbedo effects . \\nIllumination \\t. \\nAlbedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light , \\texcept in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth 's surface at that location ( e.g . \\nthrough melting of \\treflective ice ) . \\nThat said , albedo and \\tillumination both vary by latitude . \\nAlbedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the \\tsubtropics , with a local maximum in the tropics . \\nInsolation \\teffects . \\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ) ; high albedo areas in the Arctic and Antarctic \\tregions are cold due to low insolation , whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation . \\nTropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much \\thotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation . \\nBecause insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas \\tlike the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes . \\nArctic regions notably release more heat back into space \\tthan what they absorb , effectively cooling the Earth . \\nThis has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures , creating regions in \\tthe arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space . \\nThis feedback loop results in \\ta reduced albedo effect . \\nClimate and \\tweather . \\nAlbedo affects climate by determining how \\tmuch radiation a planet absorbs . \\nThe uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land \\t, ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather . \\nAlbedo–temperature \\tfeedback . \\nWhen an area 's albedo changes due \\tto snowfall , a snow–temperature feedback results . \\nA layer of snowfall increases local albedo , \\treflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling . \\nIn principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( e.g. , a warm air mass ) , \\tthe raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow–temperature feedback . \\nHowever , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm \\tair masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting . \\nWhen the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass , soil , or ocean , the effect is reversed : the \\tdarkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating . \\nSnow \\t. \\nSnow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow \\t, to about 0.4 for melting snow , and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow . \\nOver Antarctica snow albedo averages \\ta little more than 0.8 . \\nIf a marginally snow-covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading \\tto more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice–albedo positive feedback ) . \\nJust as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow , the \\talbedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water . \\nSea water absorbs more solar radiation than would \\tthe same surface covered with reflective snow . \\nWhen sea ice melts , either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above , \\tthe snow-covered surface is reduced , and more surface of sea water is exposed , so the rate of energy absorption increases . \\nThe extra absorbed energy heats the sea water , which \\tin turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts . \\nAs with the preceding example of snowmelt , the process of melting \\tof sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback . \\nBoth positive feedback loops have long been \\trecognized as important for global warming . \\nCryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , \\tsometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets . \\nThe dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback , together with the effects of \\tsmall errors in the measurement of albedo , can lead to large errors in energy estimates . \\nBecause of this , in order to reduce the error of energy estimates , it is important to measure the \\talbedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions . \\nSmall-scale \\teffects . \\nAlbedo works on a \\tsmaller scale , too . \\nIn sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing \\tsome control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing . \\nSolar photovoltaic \\teffects . \\nAlbedo can affect the electrical energy \\toutput of solar photovoltaic devices . \\nFor example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology \\tbased on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a-Si : H ) and crystalline silicon ( c-Si ) -based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions . \\nResearch showed impacts of over 10 % for vertically ( 90° ) mounted systems \\t, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts . \\nSpectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains \\tof over 20 % have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation . \\nAn analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials ( both human-made and natural ) provided effective albedo values for simulating \\tthe performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial ( solar farms ) , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications . \\nTrees \\t. \\nBecause forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have \\tsuggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation ) . \\nIn the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction \\tmay be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect . \\nTrees also impact climate in \\textremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration . \\nThe water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , \\tacts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds . \\nScientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate \\timpact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate . \\nIn seasonally snow-covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 % to 50 \\t% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily . \\nDeciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 \\twhereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15 . \\nVariation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high \\tgrowth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy . \\nThe result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be \\treflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy . \\nStudies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect \\tof albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests . \\nThey found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new \\tforests in high latitudes ( e.g. , Siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming . \\nWater \\t. \\nWater reflects light very differently \\tfrom typical terrestrial materials . \\nThe reflectivity of a water surface \\tis calculated using the Fresnel equations . \\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth \\tso the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ) . \\nThe glint of light off water \\tis a commonplace effect of this . \\nAt small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of \\tthe steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle . \\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light \\tsuch as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles ) . \\nHowever , as mentioned above , \\twaviness causes an appreciable reduction . \\nBecause light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to \\thave a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light . \\nNote that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is \\tfoamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities . \\nFresh 'black ' ice \\texhibits Fresnel reflection . \\nSnow on top of this sea \\tice increases the albedo to 0.9 . \\nClouds \\t. \\nCloud albedo has substantial \\tinfluence over atmospheric temperatures . \\nDifferent types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo \\tfrom a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8 . \\n`` On any given day , about half of Earth is covered \\tby clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . \\nClouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they \\tcan also serve as blankets to trap warmth . '' \\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , \\tsuch as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic . \\nA study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under \\tthe burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies . \\nAerosol \\teffects . \\nAerosols ( very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere ) have \\tboth direct and indirect effects on Earth 's radiative balance . \\nThe direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( \\tthe particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain . \\nAs per Spracklen \\tet al . \\nthe effects are : In extremely polluted cities like Delhi , aerosol pollutants \\tinfluence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day . \\nBlack \\tcarbon . \\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate \\tis from black carbon particles . \\nThe size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative \\tforcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2 , with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2 . \\nBlack carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap \\tin the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo . \\nHuman \\tactivities . \\nHuman activities ( e.g. , deforestation , farming , and urbanization \\t) change the albedo of various areas around the globe . \\nAs per Campra et al. , human impacts to `` the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate \\tby altering the Earth ’ s radiative energy balance '' even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites . \\nThe tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in Almería \\t, Spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs . \\nA 2008 study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface \\tarea temperature of the high-albedo area , although changes were localized . \\nA follow-up study found \\tthat `` CO2-eq . \\nemissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land \\ttransformation '' and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change . \\nIt has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo ( commonly being \\t0.01–0.02 lower than adjacent croplands ) , which contributes to global warming . \\nDeliberately increasing albedo in urban areas \\tcan mitigate urban heat island . \\nOuyang et \\tal . \\nestimated that , on a global scale , `` an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas \\twould result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 Gt of CO2 emissions . '' \\nIntentionally enhancing the albedo of the Earth 's surface , along with its daytime thermal emittance , has been proposed as \\ta solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling ( PDRC ) . \\nEfforts toward widespread implementation of PDRCs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to \\thigh values , so long as a thermal emittance of at least 90 % can be achieved . \\nAstronomical \\talbedo . \\nIn astronomy , the term albedo can be defined in several different ways \\t, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved . \\nOptical or \\tvisual albedo . \\nThe albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as \\tasteroids can be used to infer much about their properties . \\nThe study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( `` phase angle '' \\t) , and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . \\nFor small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes , \\tmuch of what we know comes from the study of their albedos . \\nFor example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects , the variation of albedo \\twith phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids . \\nEnceladus , a moon of Saturn , has one of the highest known optical \\talbedos of any body in the Solar System , with an albedo of 0.99 . \\nAnother notable high-albedo body is Eris \\t, with an albedo of 0.96 . \\nMany small objects in the outer Solar System and \\tasteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05 . \\nA typical comet nucleus has \\tan albedo of 0.04 . \\nSuch a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a \\tprimitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds . \\nThe overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14 , but \\tit is strongly directional and non-Lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect . \\nAlthough such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , \\tthey are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies . \\nTwo common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( V-band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination \\tcomes from directly behind the observer ) and the Bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected ) . \\nTheir values can differ significantly , which \\tis a common source of confusion . \\nIn detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters \\twhich semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces . \\nOne of these five parameters is yet another \\ttype of albedo called the single-scattering albedo . \\nIt is used to define scattering \\tof electromagnetic waves on small particles . \\nIt depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ) , the \\tsize of the particle , and the wavelength of the incoming radiation . \\nAn important relationship between an object 's astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is given by : \\tformula_7 where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo , formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers , and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude . \\nRadar \\talbedo . \\nIn planetary radar astronomy , a microwave ( or radar \\t) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target ( e.g . \\nMoon , asteroid \\t, etc . ) \\nand the echo from \\tthe target is measured . \\nIn most instances , the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the \\tsame sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse ( SC ) and the opposite sense ( OC ) . \\nThe echo power is measured in terms of radar cross-section , formula_11 , formula_12 , or formula_13 ( total power , SC + OC ) and is \\tequal to the cross-sectional area of a metallic sphere ( perfect reflector ) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power . \\nThose components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections ( as from a smooth or mirror-like \\tsurface ) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection . \\nIf the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the \\tregolith , there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering . \\nFor most objects in the solar system , the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the ( normalized ) OC radar \\talbedo ( often shortened to radar albedo ) : formula_14 where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius , formula_15 . \\nA smooth metallic sphere \\twould have formula_16 . \\nRadar albedos of \\tSolar System objects . \\nThe values reported for the Moon , Mercury , Mars , Venus , and Comet P/2005 \\tJQ5 are derived from the total ( OC+SC ) radar albedo reported in those references . \\nRelationship to surface \\tbulk density . \\nIn the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections ( formula_17 or so ) , the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient ( aka reflectivity ) and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so ( a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale ) using the following empirical relationships : < /doc

ActresseS '' > ActresseS < /doc > < doc id= '' 290 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=290 '' title= '' A '' > A A , or a , is the first letter and the first vowel of the Latin alphabet , used in the modern English alphabet , the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide . \\nIts name in English is `` a '' \\t( pronounced ) , plural `` aes '' . \\nIt is similar in shape to the Ancient \\tGreek letter alpha , from which it derives . \\nThe uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a \\ttriangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar . \\nThe lowercase version can be written in two \\tforms : the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ . \\nThe latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts \\tintended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type . \\nIn English grammar , `` a '' , and \\tits variant `` an '' , are indefinite articles . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe earliest certain ancestor of `` A '' is aleph ( also written 'aleph ) , the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet , \\twhich consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ) . \\nIn turn , the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in \\tproto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended . \\nWhen the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages , and \\tthat was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha . \\nIn the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages , dating to the eighth century BC , the letter rests upon its side , but in the Greek alphabet of later times \\tit generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set . \\nThe Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization \\tin the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged . \\nThe Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language , and the resulting letter was \\tpreserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including English . \\nTypographic \\tvariants . \\nDuring Roman times , there were many variant \\tforms of the letter `` A '' . \\nFirst was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used \\twhen inscribing on stone or other `` permanent '' media . \\nThere was also a cursive style used for everyday or \\tutilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces . \\nDue to the `` perishable '' nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental \\t, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule . \\nVariants also existed that were intermediate \\tbetween the monumental and cursive styles . \\nThe known variants include the early semi-uncial , \\tthe uncial , and the later semi-uncial . \\nAt the end of the Roman Empire ( 5th century AD ) \\t, several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe . \\nAmong these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy , the Merovingian script in France , the Visigothic \\tscript in Spain , and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain . \\nBy the ninth century , the Caroline script , which was very similar to the present-day form \\t, was the principal form used in book-making , before the advent of the printing press . \\nThis form was derived through \\ta combining of prior forms . \\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the \\ttwo main variants that are known today . \\nThese variants , the `` Italic '' and `` Roman \\t'' forms , were derived from the Caroline Script version . \\nThe Italic form , also called `` script a , '' is used in most current handwriting \\t; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ( `` ɑ '' ) . \\nThis slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter \\ttau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers . \\nThe Roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of \\ta small loop with an arc over it ( `` a '' ) . \\nBoth derive from the majuscule \\t( capital ) form . \\nIn Greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal \\tstroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown . \\nMany fonts then made \\tthe right leg vertical . \\nIn some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting \\tin the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form . \\nGraphic designers refer to the `` Italic '' and `` Roman '' forms \\tas `` single decker a '' and `` double decker a '' respectively . \\nItalic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one \\tpart of a text from the rest ( set in Roman type ) . \\nThere are some other cases aside from italic type where `` script a '' ( `` ɑ '' ) , also called \\tLatin alpha , is used in contrast with Latin `` a '' ( such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet ) . \\nUse in \\twriting systems . \\nEnglish \\t. \\nIn modern English orthography , the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds : The double sequence does not occur in native \\tEnglish words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as `` Aaron '' and `` aardvark '' . \\nHowever , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their \\town sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and . \\nis the third-most-commonly used letter in English ( after and ) and French , \\tthe second most common in Spanish , and the most common in Portuguese . \\nAbout 8.167 % of letters used in English texts tend to be ; the number is \\taround 7.636 % in French , 11.525 % in Spanish , and 14.634 % for Portuguese . \\nOther \\tlanguages . \\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet , denotes \\tan open unrounded vowel , such as , , or . \\nAn exception is Saanich , in which ( and the \\tglyph Á ) stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel . \\nOther \\tsystems . \\nIn phonetic and phonemic \\tnotation : Other uses . \\nIn algebra , the letter `` a '' along with various other letters of the alphabet is \\toften used to denote a variable , with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics . \\nMoreover , in 1637 , René Descartes `` invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x , y , and z , \\tand knowns by a , b , and c '' , and this convention is still often followed , especially in elementary algebra . \\nIn geometry , capital A \\t, B , C etc . \\nare used to denote segments , \\tlines , rays , etc . \\nA capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an \\tangle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A . \\n`` A '' is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : A− , A or A+ , \\tthe best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ; `` A grade '' for clean restaurants ; A-list celebrities , etc . \\nSuch associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter \\tA has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters . \\n`` A '' is used as a prefix on some words , such as asymmetry \\t, to mean `` not '' or `` without '' ( from Greek ) . \\nIn English grammar , `` a '' , and its variant `` an \\t'' , is an indefinite article , used to introduce noun phrases . \\nFinally , the letter A is used to denote size , as in \\ta narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere . \\nCode \\tpoints . \\nThese are the code points for the forms of \\tthe letter in various systems Use as a number . \\nIn the hexadecimal ( base 16 ) numbering system , A is a number \\tthat corresponds to the number 10 in decimal ( base 10 ) counting . \\n< /doc >

total of of inland waterways , \\tAlabama has among the most of any state . \\nAlabama is nicknamed the `` Yellowhammer State \\t'' , after the state bird . \\nAlabama is also known as the `` Heart of

the United States to become part of the Confederate States \\tof America , with Montgomery acting as its first capital , and rejoined the Union in 1868 . \\nFollowing the American Civil War , Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship , in part due \\tto agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state 's economy . \\nSimilar to other former slave states , Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against \\tAfrican Americans and also Alabama 's French Creole population from the late 19th century up until the 1960s . \\nIn the early 20th century , despite the growth of major industries and urban \\tcenters , white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid-20th century . \\nDuring this time , urban interests \\tand African Americans were markedly under-represented . \\nHigh-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery march made the state a \\tmajor focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s . \\nDuring and after World War II , Alabama grew \\tas the state 's economy diversified with new industries . \\nNASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville would help Alabama 's economic \\tgrowth in the mid-to-late 20th century , by developing an aerospace industry . \\nAlabama 's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive , finance , tourism , \\tmanufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology . \\nThe state 's geography is diverse , with the north dominated by the mountainous \\tTennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay , a historically significant port . \\nPolitically , as part of the Deep South , Alabama is predominantly \\ta conservative state , and is known for its Southern culture . \\nWithin Alabama , American football , particularly at the college level at schools such as the University of Alabama , Auburn University , Alabama A & amp ; M \\tUniversity , Alabama State University , Troy University , the University of South Alabama , and Jacksonville State University , plays a major part of the state 's culture . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people , a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose \\tmembers lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river . \\nIn the Alabama language , the word for a person of Alabama lineage is \\t( or variously or in different dialects ; the plural form is ) . \\nThe word 's spelling varies \\tsignificantly among historical sources . \\nThe first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 : Garcilaso de la Vega used , while \\tthe Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote `` Alibamu '' and `` Limamu '' , respectively , in transliterations of the term . \\nAs early as 1702 , the French called the tribe \\tthe , with French maps identifying the river as . \\nOther spellings of the name have included `` Alibamu '' , `` Alabamo '' , `` Albama '' , \\t`` Alebamon '' , `` Alibama '' , `` Alibamou '' , `` Alabamu '' , `` Allibamou '' . \\nand possibly `` \\tAlabahmu '' . \\nThe use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in \\tthe U.S. ; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin . \\nSources disagree on the \\tword 's meaning . \\nSome scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw ( meaning 'plants ' or 'weeds ' ) \\tand ( meaning 'to cut ' , 'to trim ' , or 'to gather ' ) . \\nThe meaning may have been 'clearers of the thicket ' or 'herb gatherers \\t' , referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants . \\nThe state has numerous place \\tnames of Native American origin . \\nHowever , there are no correspondingly \\tsimilar words in the Alabama language . \\nAn 1842 article in the `` Jacksonville Republican \\t'' proposed it meant 'Here We Rest ' . \\nThis notion was popularized in the 1850s \\tthrough the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek . \\nExperts in the Muskogean languages have not found \\tany evidence to support such a translation . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPre-European \\tsettlement . \\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for \\tthousands of years before the advent of European colonization . \\nTrade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the \\tBurial Mound Period ( 1000BCE700CE ) and continued until European contact . \\nThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE , with one \\tof its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville , Alabama . \\nThis is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era , after \\tCahokia in present-day Illinois , which was the center of the culture . \\nAnalysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars \\t' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex ( SECC ) . \\nContrary to popular belief , the SECC appears to have \\tno direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently . \\nThe Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples \\t; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood . \\nAmong the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee , an \\tIroquoian language people ; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama ( `` Alibamu '' ) , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek , and Koasati . \\nWhile part of the same large language family , \\tthe Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages . \\nEuropean \\tsettlement . \\nThe Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during \\ttheir exploration of North America in the 16th century . \\nThe expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila \\tand other parts of the state in 1540 . \\nMore than 160 years later , the French founded the \\tregion 's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702 . \\nThe city was moved to the \\tcurrent site of Mobile in 1711 . \\nThis area was claimed by the French from \\t1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane . \\nAfter the French lost to the British in the Seven Years ' War \\t, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783 . \\nAfter the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War , \\tthe territory was divided between the United States and Spain . \\nThe latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of \\tthe Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13 , 1813 . \\nThomas Bassett , a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era \\t, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile . \\nHe settled in the Tombigbee \\tDistrict during the early 1770s . \\nThe district 's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and \\tincluded portions of what is today southern Clarke County , northernmost Mobile County , and most of Washington County . \\nWhat is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783 , part of \\tthe independent Republic of West Florida in 1810 , and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812 . \\nMost of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was \\tknown as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period . \\nIt was claimed by the Province \\tof Georgia from 1767 onwards . \\nFollowing the Revolutionary War , it remained a \\tpart of Georgia , although heavily disputed . \\nWith the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands , what is now the \\tlower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798 . \\nThe Yazoo lands were added to the territory \\tin 1804 , following the Yazoo land scandal . \\nSpain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the \\tcoastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819 . \\n19th \\tcentury . \\nBefore Mississippi 's admission to statehood on December 10 , 1817 , the more \\tsparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory . \\nThe United States Congress created the Alabama \\tTerritory on March 3 , 1817 . \\nSt. Stephens , now abandoned , served as \\tthe territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 . \\nAlabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14 , 1819 , \\twith Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention . \\nFrom July5 to August 2 , 1819 , \\tdelegates met to prepare the new state constitution . \\nHuntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 , when \\tthe seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County . \\nCahaba , now a ghost town , was the \\tfirst permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 . \\nThe Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union , with settlers \\tand land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation . \\nPart of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s , \\tits constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men . \\nSoutheastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves \\twith them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded . \\nThe economy of the central Black Belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) \\twas built around large cotton plantations whose owners ' wealth grew mainly from slave labor . \\nThe area also drew many poor , \\tdisenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers . \\nAlabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810 \\t, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830 . \\nMost Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few \\tyears of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830 . \\nFrom 1826 to 1846 , Tuscaloosa \\tserved as Alabama 's capital . \\nOn January 30 , 1846 , the Alabama legislature announced it \\thad voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery . \\nThe first legislative session in the \\tnew capital met in December 1847 . \\nA new capitol building was erected under the \\tdirection of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia . \\nThe first structure burned down in 1849 , but \\twas rebuilt on the same site in 1851 . \\nThis second capitol building in Montgomery \\tremains to the present day . \\nIt was designed by Barachias \\tHolt of Exeter , Maine . \\nCivil War \\tand Reconstruction . \\nBy 1860 , the population had increased to 964,201 people , of which nearly half \\t, 435,080 , were enslaved African Americans , and 2,690 were free people of color . \\nOn January 11 , 1861 , Alabama \\tdeclared its secession from the Union . \\nAfter remaining an independent republic for a few days \\t, it joined the Confederate States of America . \\nThe Confederacy 's capital \\twas initially at Montgomery . \\nAlabama was heavily involved in \\tthe American Civil War . \\nAlthough comparatively few battles were fought in the state , \\tAlabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort . \\nA company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville , Alabama , \\tjoined Nathan Bedford Forrest 's battalion in Hopkinsville , Kentucky . \\nThe company wore new uniforms with yellow trim \\ton the sleeves , collar and coattails . \\nThis led to them being greeted with `` Yellowhammer '' , and the \\tname later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army . \\nAlabama 's slaves were freed by \\tthe 13th Amendment in 1865 . \\nAlabama was under military rule from the end of the war in \\tMay 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868 . \\nFrom 1867 to 1874 , with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and \\tfreedmen enfranchised , many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state . \\nAlabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen \\t: Jeremiah Haralson , Benjamin S. Turner , and James T. Rapier . \\nFollowing the war , the state remained chiefly \\tagricultural , with an economy tied to cotton . \\nDuring Reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which \\tcreated the state 's first public school system and expanded women 's rights . \\nLegislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although \\tthese were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation . \\nOrganized insurgent , resistance groups tried \\tto suppress the freedmen and Republicans . \\nBesides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan , these included the Pale Faces , \\tKnights of the White Camellia , Red Shirts , and the White League . \\nReconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874 , when the Democrats regained control of the \\tlegislature and governor 's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence . \\nThey wrote another constitution in 1875 , and the legislature passed the Blaine \\tAmendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools . \\nThe same year , legislation was approved \\tthat called for racially segregated schools . \\nRailroad passenger cars were \\tsegregated in 1891 . \\n20th \\tcentury . \\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all African Americans and \\tNative Americans , and tens of thousands of poor European Americans , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test . \\nThe 1901 constitution required racial \\tsegregation of public schools . \\nBy 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in \\tAlabama , although at least 74,000 were literate . \\nThis compared to more than 181,000 African \\tAmericans eligible to vote in 1900 . \\nThe numbers dropped even \\tmore in later decades . \\nThe state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s : jails were segregated in 1911 \\t; hospitals in 1915 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 1928 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 . \\nWhile the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the \\tnew restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax . \\nBy 1941 , whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised \\tby these laws : 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans . \\nNearly all Blacks had lost \\tthe ability to vote . \\nDespite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions , \\tthe state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement . \\nThe exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of \\tfederal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens . \\nThe rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised \\tAfrican Americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes . \\nPartially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South , \\tthe Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools . \\nIn Alabama , these schools were designed , and the construction partially \\tfinanced with Rosenwald funds , which paid one-third of the construction costs . \\nThe fund required the local community and state \\tto raise matching funds to pay the rest . \\nBlack residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply \\tmatching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas . \\nThey often donated land \\tand labor as well . \\nBeginning in 1913 , the first 80 Rosenwald Schools \\twere built in Alabama for African American children . \\nA total of 387 schools , seven teachers ' houses , \\tand several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state . \\nSeveral of the surviving school buildings in the state are \\tnow listed on the National Register of Historic Places . \\nContinued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural \\tAlabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South . \\nReflecting this emigration , the population growth rate in Alabama ( see `` historical \\tpopulations '' table below ) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 . \\nAt the same time , many rural people migrated to \\tthe city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs . \\nBirmingham experienced such rapid growth it was \\tcalled the `` Magic City '' . \\nBy 1920 , Birmingham was the \\t36th-largest city in the United States . \\nHeavy industry and mining were \\tthe basis of its economy . \\nIts residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature , which refused to redistrict after \\teach decennial census according to population changes , as it was required by the state constitution . \\nThis did not change until the late \\t1960s following a lawsuit and court order . \\nIndustrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level \\tof prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war . \\nRural workers poured into the largest cities in the state \\tfor better jobs and a higher standard of living . \\nOne example of this massive influx \\tof workers occurred in Mobile . \\nBetween 1940 and 1943 , more than 89,000 people \\tmoved into the city to work for war-related industries . \\nCotton and other cash crops faded in importance as \\tthe state developed a manufacturing and service base . \\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 , the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and \\tSenate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses . \\nThey held on to old representation to maintain \\tpolitical and economic power in agricultural areas . \\nOne result was that Jefferson County , containing Birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than \\tone-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services . \\nUrban interests were consistently \\tunderrepresented in the legislature . \\nA 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , `` a minority of about 25 \\t% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature . '' \\nIn the United States Supreme Court cases of `` Baker v. Carr '' ( 1962 ) and `` Reynolds v. Sims '' ( 1964 ) , the court ruled that the principle of \\t`` one man , one vote '' needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures , and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties . \\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and \\tsegregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges . \\nIn 1954 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in `` Brown v. Board of Education \\t'' that public schools had to be desegregated , but Alabama was slow to comply . \\nDuring the 1960s , under Governor George Wallace , \\tAlabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation . \\nThe civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama , including the Montgomery bus boycott \\t( 1955–1956 ) , Freedom Rides in 1961 , and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches . \\nThese contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act \\tof 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress . \\nLegal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but \\tJim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court . \\nAccording to `` The New York Times '' , by 2017 , many of Alabama \\t's African Americans were living in Alabama 's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery . \\nAlso , the Black Belt region across central Alabama `` \\tis home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American . \\nThese counties include Dallas , Lowndes \\t, Marengo and Perry . '' \\nIn 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the \\tlegislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census . \\nThis benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all \\tin the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years . \\nOther changes were made to implement \\trepresentative state house and senate districts . \\nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century \\tand has used new types of voting to increase representation . \\nIn the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , `` Dillard v. Crenshaw County '' , challenged \\tthe at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards . \\nAt-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a \\tcounty , as the majority tended to take all seats . \\nDespite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state , they \\thad been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions . \\nAs part of settlement of this case , five Alabama cities and counties , including Chilton \\tCounty , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions . \\nThis has resulted in more \\tproportional representation for voters . \\nIn another form of proportional representation , 23 jurisdictions \\tuse limited voting , as in Conecuh County . \\nIn 1982 , limited voting was \\tfirst tested in Conecuh County . \\nTogether use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being \\telected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens . \\nBeginning in the 1960s , the state 's economy shifted away from its \\ttraditional lumber , steel , and textile industries because of increased foreign competition . \\nSteel jobs , for instance , declined from \\t46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011 . \\nHowever , the state , particularly Huntsville , benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight \\tCenter in 1960 , a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle . \\nTechnology and manufacturing industries , such as automobile assembly , replaced some the state 's older industries in the late twentieth century \\t, but the state 's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area , such as Georgia and Florida . \\n21st \\tcentury . \\nIn 2001 , Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed \\ta statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery . \\nIn 2002 , the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed , but Moore refused to follow \\tthe court order , which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument . \\nThe monument was removed \\tin August 2003 . \\nA few natural disasters have occurred in \\tthe state in the twenty-first century . \\nIn 2004 , Hurricane Ivan , a category 3 storm upon landfall \\t, struck the state and caused over $ 18 billion of damage . \\nIt was among the most destructive storms to \\tstrike the state in its modern history . \\nA super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in \\tApril 2011 and killed 238 people , devastating many communities . \\nGeography \\t. \\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area : 3.2 % of the area is water , \\tmaking Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water , also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States . \\nAbout three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain , a \\tgentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico . \\nThe North Alabama region is mostly mountainous , with the Tennessee River cutting a large \\tvalley and creating numerous creeks , streams , rivers , mountains , and lakes . \\nAlabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north , Georgia to \\tthe east , Florida to the south , and Mississippi to the west . \\nAlabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico , \\tin the extreme southern edge of the state . \\nThe state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay \\tto more than in the northeast , to Mount Cheaha at . \\nAlabama 's land consists of of forest or 67 \\t% of the state 's total land area . \\nSuburban Baldwin County , along the Gulf Coast , is the largest \\tcounty in the state in both land area and water area . \\nAreas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City ; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort \\tPayne ; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport ; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee ; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee . \\nAdditionally , Alabama has four National Forests : Conecuh \\t, Talladega , Tuskegee , and William B. Bankhead . \\nAlabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway , the Selma To Montgomery \\tNational Historic Trail , and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail . \\nNotable natural wonders include : the `` Natural Bridge '' rock , the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies , located just south of Haleyville ; Cathedral Caverns in Marshall County , named for its cathedral-like appearance , features one of the largest cave entrances and stalagmites in the world ; Ecor Rouge in Fairhope , the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico ; DeSoto Caverns in Childersburg , the first officially recorded cave in the United States ; Noccalula Falls in Gadsden features a 90-foot waterfall ; Dismals Canyon near \\tPhil Campbell , home to two waterfalls , six natural bridges and allegedly served as a hideout for legendary outlaw Jesse James ; Stephens Gap Cave in Jackson County boasts a 143-foot pit , two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America ; Little River Canyon near Fort Payne , one of the nation 's longest mountaintop rivers ; Rickwood Caverns near Warrior features an underground pool , blind cave fish and 260-million-year-old limestone formations ; and the Walls of Jericho canyon on the Alabama-Tennessee state line . \\nA -wide meteorite impact crater is located in \\tElmore County , just north of Montgomery . \\nThis is the Wetumpka crater , the site \\tof `` Alabama 's greatest natural disaster '' . \\nA -wide meteorite hit the area \\tabout 80 million years ago . \\nThe hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock , with the area labeled the Wetumpka \\tcrater or astrobleme ( `` star-wound '' ) because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface . \\nIn 2002 , Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published \\tevidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth . \\nClimate \\t. \\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical ( `` \\tCfa '' ) under the Koppen Climate Classification . \\nThe average annual temperature is \\t64°F ( 18°C ) . \\nTemperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico , while \\tthe northern parts of the state , especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast , tend to be slightly cooler . \\nGenerally , Alabama has very hot summers and \\tmild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year . \\nAlabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing \\tseason of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state . \\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S. , with high \\ttemperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state . \\nAlabama is also prone to \\ttropical storms and hurricanes . \\nAreas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of \\tthe storms , which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken . \\nSouth Alabama reports \\tmany thunderstorms . \\nThe Gulf Coast , around Mobile Bay , averages between \\t70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported . \\nThis activity decreases somewhat further north in the state , but even the \\tfar north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year . \\nOccasionally , thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail ; the central \\tand northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm . \\nAlabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and \\ttenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita . \\nAlabama , along with Oklahoma and Iowa , has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state , \\taccording to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1 , 1950 , to June 2013 . \\nSeveral long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting \\tmore tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state . \\nThe state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak \\tand was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak . \\nThe 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record \\tamount of tornadoes in the state . \\nThe tally \\treached 62 . \\nThe peak season for tornadoes varies from the \\tnorthern to southern parts of the state . \\nAlabama is one of the few places in the world that has a \\tsecondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring . \\nThe northern part—along the Tennessee \\tRiver Valley—is most vulnerable . \\nThe area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to \\tas Dixie Alley , as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains . \\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama , as they are throughout most of the Southeastern \\tUnited States , with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham . \\nAlthough snow is a rare event in much of Alabama , areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive \\ta dusting of snow a few times every winter , with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years . \\nHistoric snowfall events include New Year 's Eve 1963 \\tsnowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century . \\nThe annual average snowfall for the \\tBirmingham area is per year . \\nIn the southern Gulf coast , snowfall is less \\tfrequent , sometimes going several years without any snowfall . \\nAlabama 's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5 \\t, 1925 , in the unincorporated community of Centerville . \\nThe record low of occurred on January \\t30 , 1966 , in New Market . \\nFlora and \\tfauna . \\nAlabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley , Appalachian Plateau , and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north \\tto the Piedmont , Canebrake , and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south . \\nThe state is usually ranked among the top \\tin nation for its range of overall biodiversity . \\nAlabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of \\tpine forest , which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state . \\nIt currently ranks fifth in the nation \\tfor the diversity of its flora . \\nIt is home to nearly 4,000 \\tpteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species . \\nIndigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species , 93 reptile species , 73 amphibian species , roughly 307 \\tnative freshwater fish species , and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state . \\nInvertebrates include 97 crayfish species \\tand 383 mollusk species . \\n113 of these mollusk species have \\tnever been collected outside the state . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nAccording to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279 on April 1 , \\t2020 , which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12 % , since the 2010 census . \\nThis includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 ( 502,457 births minus \\t381,403 deaths ) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state . \\nImmigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people \\t, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people . \\nThe state had 108,000 foreign-born ( 2.4 % of the state population ) \\t, of which an estimated 22.2 % were undocumented ( 24,000 ) . \\nAlabama has the 5th highest African American population among \\tUS states at 25.8 % as of 2020 . \\nThe center of population of Alabama is located in \\tChilton County , outside the town of Jemison . \\nAncestry \\t. \\nThose citing `` American '' ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction , however most English Americans identify simply as having \\tAmerican ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long , in many cases since the early 1600s . \\nDemographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23 % of people in Alabama are \\tof predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher . \\nIn the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total \\tstate population of 2,824,719 making them 41 % of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group . \\nIn 2011 , 46.6 % of Alabama \\t's population younger than age1 were minorities . \\nThe largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are American ( 13.4 % ) , Irish ( 10.5 % ) , English ( \\t10.2 % ) , German ( 7.9 % ) , and Scots-Irish ( 2.5 % ) based on 2006-2008 Census data . \\nThe Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution , \\tand many settled in the South , later moving into the Deep South as it was developed . \\nIn 1984 , under the Davis–Strong Act , the \\tstate legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission . \\nNative American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding \\trecognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination . \\nGiven the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation , the Native American peoples , \\twho have sometimes been of mixed race , have insisted on having their cultural identification respected . \\nIn the past , their self-identification was often overlooked as the state \\ttried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black . \\nThe state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state \\t, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast . \\nThese are \\tthe following . \\nThe state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state , including the \\tdesignation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day . \\nLanguage \\t. \\nMost Alabama residents ( 95.1 % of those five and older ) spoke only \\tEnglish at home in 2010 , a minor decrease from 96.1 % in 2000 . \\nAlabama English is predominantly Southern , and is related to South \\tMidland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee . \\nIn the major Southern speech region , there is the decreasing loss of the final \\t`` r '' , for example the `` boyd '' pronunciation of `` bird '' . \\nIn the northern third of the state , there is a South Midland `` arm '' \\tand `` barb '' rhyming with `` form '' and `` orb '' , respectively . \\nUnique words in Alabama English include : redworm ( earthworm ) , peckerwood ( woodpecker ) , snake doctor and snake feeder ( dragonfly ) , \\ttow sack ( burlap bag ) , plum peach ( clingstone ) , French harp ( harmonica ) , and dog irons ( andirons ) . \\nReligion \\t. \\nIn the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey , 86 % of Alabama respondents reported their religion \\tas Christian , including 6 % Catholic , with 11 % as having no religion . \\nThe composition of other traditions is 0.5 % Mormon , 0.5 % Jewish \\t, 0.5 % Muslim , 0.5 % Buddhist , and 0.5 % Hindu . \\nAlabama is located in the middle of the Bible \\tBelt , a region of numerous Protestant Christians . \\nAlabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the \\tUnited States , with about 58 % of the population attending church regularly . \\nA majority of people in the \\tstate identify as Evangelical Protestant . \\n, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist \\tConvention , The United Methodist Church , and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant . \\nIn Alabama , the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121 ; this is followed by the \\tUnited Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents , non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents , and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents . \\nMany Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of \\tthe early 19th century , when preachers proselytized across the South . \\nThe Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members , \\tthe Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members . \\nThe Presbyterian churches , strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants , had a combined membership around 75,000 ( PCA—28,009 members in 108 congregations , PC ( USA ) —26,247 members in \\t147 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church—6,000 members in 59 congregations , the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations ) . \\nIn a 2007 survey , nearly 70 % of \\trespondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels . \\nOf those who indicated a religious preference , 59 % said they possessed \\ta `` full understanding '' of their faith and needed no further learning . \\nIn a 2007 poll , 92 % of Alabamians reported \\thaving at least some confidence in churches in the state . \\nAlthough in much smaller numbers , many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well , \\tincluding Judaism , Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism , Sikhism , the Baháʼí Faith , and Unitarian Universalism . \\nJews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763 , during \\tthe colonial era of Mobile , when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London . \\nThe oldest Jewish congregation in the state \\tis Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile . \\nIt was formally recognized by the state \\tlegislature on January 25 , 1844 . \\nLater immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \\ttended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe . \\nJewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox , four \\tConservative , ten Reform , and one Humanistic synagogue . \\nMuslims have been increasing in Alabama , with 31 \\tmosques built by 2011 , many by African-American converts . \\nSeveral Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants , the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham , the \\tHindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham , the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw , and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa . \\nThere are six Dharma centers \\tand organizations for Theravada Buddhists . \\nMost monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern \\tMobile County , near Bayou La Batre . \\nThis area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia \\t, Laos , and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter . \\nThe four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre , \\tinclude Chua Chanh Giac , Wat Buddharaksa , and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan . \\nThe first community of adherents of the Baháʼí Faith in Alabama was founded \\tin 1896 by Paul K. Dealy , who moved from Chicago to Fairhope . \\nBaháʼí centers in Alabama exist in \\tBirmingham , Huntsville , and Florence . \\nHealth \\t. \\nIn 2018 , life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years , below the national \\taverage of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country . \\nFactors that can cause lower life expectancy are \\tmaternal mortality , suicide , and gun crimes . \\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem , with most counties \\thaving more than 29 % of adults obese , except for ten which had a rate between 26 % and 29 % . \\nResidents of the state , along with those in five other states , \\twere least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time . \\nAlabama , and the southeastern U.S. in general , has one of the highest \\tincidences of adult onset diabetes in the country , exceeding 10 % of adults . \\nOn May 14 , 2019 , Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act , banning abortion at any stage \\tof pregnancy unless there is a `` serious health risk '' , with no exceptions for rape and incest . \\nThe law subjects doctors who perform abortions \\twith 10 to 99 years imprisonment . \\nThe law was originally supposed to take effect the following November , but on October 29 , 2019 , U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson \\tblocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case `` Roe v. Wade '' . \\nOn June 24 , 2022 , after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned `` Roe v. Wade '' in `` Dobbs v. \\tJackson Women 's Health Organization '' , Judge Thompson lifted the injunction , allowing the law to go into effect . \\nEconomy \\t. \\nThe state has invested in aerospace , education , health care , banking , and \\tvarious heavy industries , including automobile manufacturing , mineral extraction , steel production and fabrication . \\nBy 2006 , crop and animal production \\tin Alabama was valued at $ 1.5billion . \\nIn contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century , this \\twas only about one percent of the state 's gross domestic product . \\nThe number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s , \\tas land has been sold to developers , timber companies , and large farming conglomerates . \\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations ; 71,750 in business and financial operations ; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation ; 44,200 in architecture and engineering ; 12,410 in life , physical , and social sciences ; 32,260 in community and social services ; 12,770 in legal occupations ; 116,250 in education , training , and library services ; 27,840 in art , design and media occupations ; 121,110 in healthcare ; 44,750 in fire fighting , law \\tenforcement , and security ; 154,040 in food preparation and serving ; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance ; 53,230 in personal care and services ; 244,510 in sales ; 338,760 in office and administration support ; 20,510 in farming , fishing , and forestry ; 120,155 in construction and mining , gas , and oil extraction ; 106,280 in installation , maintenance , and repair ; 224,110 in production ; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving . \\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis , the 2008 total \\tgross state product was $ 170billion , or $ 29,411 per capita . \\nAlabama 's 2012 GDP increased 1.2 \\t% from the previous year . \\nThe single largest increase came \\tin the area of information . \\nIn 2010 , per capita income \\tfor the state was $ 22,984 . \\nThe state 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate \\twas 5.8 % in April 2015 . \\nThis compared to a nationwide seasonally \\tadjusted rate of 5.4 % . \\nAlabama has no minimum wage and in February \\t2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one . \\n( A Birmingham city ordinance would have \\traised theirs to $ 10.10 . ) \\n, Alabama has the sixth highest poverty \\trate among states in the U.S . \\nIn 2017 , United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed \\tenvironmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world . \\nLargest \\temployers . \\nThe five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 \\twere : The next twenty largest employers , , included : Agriculture . \\nAlabama 's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs , cattle , fish , plant nursery items , peanuts \\t, cotton , grains such as corn and sorghum , vegetables , milk , soybeans , and peaches . \\nAlthough known as `` The Cotton State '' , Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton \\tproduction , according to various reports , with Texas , Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three . \\nAquaculture \\t. \\nAquaculture is a large part \\tof the economy of Alabama . \\nAlabamians began to practice aquaculture \\tin the early 1960s . \\nU.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th \\tmost popular seafood product in America . \\nBy 2008 , approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by \\tthe catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish . \\nIn 2020 , Alabama produced of \\tthe United States ' farm-raised catfish . \\nThe total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $ 307 \\tmillion but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442 . \\nFrom the early 2000s to 2020 , the Alabamian catfish industry has declined \\tfrom 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors . \\nReasons for this decline include increased feed prices , catfish alternatives , \\tCOVID-19 's impact on restaurant sales , disease , and fish size . \\nIndustry \\t. \\nAlabama 's industrial outputs include iron and steel products ( including cast-iron and steel pipe ) ; paper , lumber \\t, and wood products ; mining ( mostly coal ) ; plastic products ; cars and trucks ; and apparel . \\nIn addition , Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products , mostly in the Huntsville area , the location of \\tNASA 's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command , headquartered at Redstone Arsenal . \\nA great deal of Alabama 's economic growth since the 1990s \\thas been due to the state 's expanding automotive manufacturing industry . \\nLocated in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama , Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama , Mercedes-Benz \\tU.S. International , and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama , as well as their various suppliers . \\nSince 1993 , the automobile industry has generated \\tmore than 67,800 new jobs in the state . \\nAlabama currently ranks 4th in \\tthe nation for vehicle exports . \\nAutomakers accounted for approximately a third of the \\tindustrial expansion in the state in 2012 . \\nThe eight models produced at the state 's auto \\tfactories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012 . \\nThe strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car , \\tthe Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck . \\nSteel producers Outokumpu , Nucor , SSAB , ThyssenKrupp , and U.S. \\tSteel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people . \\nIn May 2007 , German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile \\tCounty for a 4.65billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility . \\nThyssenKrupp 's stainless steel division , Inoxum , including the stainless portion of the \\tCalvert plant , was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012 . \\nThe remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted \\tby ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $ 1.6billion in March 2013 . \\nCompanhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert , plus \\ta majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil , for $ 3.8billion . \\nIn July 2013 , the plant was \\tsold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel . \\nThe Hunt Refining Company , a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated , \\tInc. , is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there . \\nThe company also operates terminals in \\tMobile , Melvin , and Moundville . \\nJVC America , Inc. operates an optical \\tdisc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa . \\nThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large \\tplant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people . \\nIt has been in \\toperation since 1929 . \\nConstruction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by \\tAirbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2 , 2012 . \\nThe plans include a $ 600million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex \\tfor the assembly of the A319 , A320 and A321 aircraft . \\nConstruction began in 2013 , with plans for it to become operable \\tby 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017 . \\nThe assembly plant is the company 's first \\tfactory to be built within the United States . \\nIt was announced on February 1 , 2013 , that Airbus \\thad hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility . \\nThe factory officially opened on September 14 , 2015 , covering \\tone million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland . \\nTourism and \\tentertainment . \\nAccording to Business Insider , Alabama ranked 14th \\tin most popular states to visit in 2014 . \\nAn estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $ 14.3 billion , providing directly \\tor indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state , which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $ 589 million . \\nThe state is home to various attractions , natural features , parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe , notably the annual Hangout Music Festival , held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores ; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival , one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world ; the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail , a collection of championship \\tcaliber golf courses distributed across the state ; casinos such as Victoryland ; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure ; the Riverchase Galleria , one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast ; Guntersville Lake , voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers ; and the Alabama Museum of Natural History , the oldest museum in the state . \\nMobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras \\tcelebration in the United States , beginning in 1703 . \\nIt was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in \\tthe United States in 1830 , a tradition that continues to this day . \\nMardi Gras is an official state \\tholiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties . \\nIn 2018 , Mobile 's Mardi Gras parade was the state 's \\ttop event , producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811 . \\nThe top attraction was the U.S. Space & amp ; Rocket Center in Huntsville \\twith an attendance of 849,981 , followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090 . \\nOf the parks and natural destinations , Alabama 's \\tGulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors . \\nAlabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots \\tdue to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments . \\nMovies filmed in Alabama include : Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Get Out , 42 , \\tSelma , Big Fish , The Final Destination , Due Date , Need For Speed and many more . \\nHealthcare \\t. \\nUAB Hospital , USA Health University Hospital , Huntsville Hospital , and Children \\t's Hospital of Alabama are the only LevelI trauma centers in Alabama . \\nUAB is the largest state government employer in \\tAlabama , with a workforce of about 18,000 . \\nA 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country , with Blue Cross \\tand Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84 % followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7 % . \\nBanking \\t. \\nRegions Financial Corporation is the largest bank \\theadquartered in or operating in Alabama . \\nPNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo also \\thave a major presence in Alabama . \\nWells Fargo has a regional headquarters , an operations center \\tcampus , and a $ 400million data center in Birmingham . \\nMany smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham area \\t, including ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank . \\nBirmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large \\tinvestment management companies , including Harbert Management Corporation . \\nElectronics and \\tcommunications . \\nTelecommunications provider AT & amp ; T , formerly BellSouth , has \\ta major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham . \\nMany technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville , such as ADTRAN , a network access company \\t; Intergraph , a computer graphics company ; and Avocent , an IT infrastructure company . \\nConstruction \\t. \\nBrasfield & amp ; Gorrie , BE & amp \\t; K , Hoar Construction , and B.L . \\nHarbert International , based in Alabama and subsidiaries of URS Corporation , are all routinely are \\tincluded in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design , international construction , and engineering firms . \\nLaw and \\tgovernment . \\nState \\tgovernment . \\nThe foundational document for Alabama 's government is the \\tAlabama Constitution , which was ratified in 1901 . \\nWith over 850 amendments and almost 87,000 words , it is by some accounts the world \\t's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution . \\nThere has been a significant movement to \\trewrite and modernize Alabama 's constitution . \\nCritics argue that Alabama 's constitution maintains highly centralized power with \\tthe state legislature , leaving practically no power in local hands . \\nMost counties do not \\thave home rule . \\nAny policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved \\tby the entire Alabama legislature and , frequently , by state referendum . \\nOne criticism of the current constitution claims that its \\tcomplexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism . \\nAlabama 's government is divided \\tinto three coequal branches . \\nThe legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House \\tof Representatives , with 105 members , and the Alabama Senate , with 35 members . \\nThe Legislature is responsible for writing , debating \\t, passing , or defeating state legislation . \\nThe Republican Party currently holds a majority \\tin both houses of the Legislature . \\nThe Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority \\t( most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto ) . \\nUntil 1964 , the state elected state senators on a \\tgeographic basis by county , with one per county . \\nIt had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in \\t1901 ; as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented . \\nIt had not changed legislative districts to \\treflect the decennial censuses , either . \\nIn `` Reynolds v. Sims '' ( 1964 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of `` one man , one vote '' , \\truling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented . ) \\nFurther , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned \\tby population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems . \\nAt that time , Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting \\t, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts . \\nThis had caused decades of \\tunderinvestment in such areas . \\nFor instance , Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state \\tbudget , but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding . \\nThrough the legislative delegations , the Alabama \\tlegislature kept control of county governments . \\nThe executive branch is responsible for \\tthe execution and oversight of laws . \\nIt is headed by \\tthe governor of Alabama . \\nOther members of the executive branch include the cabinet , the lieutenant governor of Alabama , the Attorney General of \\tAlabama , the Alabama Secretary of State , the Alabama State Treasurer , and the State Auditor of Alabama . \\nThe current governor is \\tRepublican Kay Ivey . \\nThe members of the Legislature take \\toffice immediately after the November elections . \\nStatewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney \\tgeneral , and other constitutional officers , take office the following January . \\nThe judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama \\tand applying the law in state criminal and civil cases . \\nThe state 's highest court is \\tthe Supreme Court of Alabama . \\nAlabama uses partisan elections \\tto select judges . \\nSince the 1980s judicial campaigns \\thave become increasingly politicized . \\nThe current chief justice of the Alabama \\tSupreme Court is Republican Tom Parker . \\nAll sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme \\tCourt are members of the Republican Party . \\nThere are two intermediate appellate courts , the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals , and four trial \\tcourts : the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ) , and the district , probate , and municipal courts . \\nSome critics believe the election of judges has \\tcontributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions . \\nAlabama has the highest per capita \\tdeath penalty rate in the country . \\nIn some years , it imposes more death sentences than does \\tTexas , a state which has a population five times larger . \\nHowever , executions per capita \\tare significantly higher in Texas . \\nSome of its cases have been highly controversial ; the U.S. \\tSupreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases . \\nIt was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death \\tsentence ; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries . \\nThis judicial authority was \\tremoved in April 2017 . \\nAlabama is one of the very few states that \\tdoes not allow the creation of state lotteries . \\nTaxes \\t. \\nTaxes are collected by the \\tAlabama Department of Revenue . \\nAlabama levies a 2 % , 4 % , or5 % personal \\tincome tax , depending on the amount earned and filing status . \\nTaxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax , even if taking the \\tstandard deduction ; those who itemize can also deduct FICA ( the Social Security and Medicare tax ) . \\nThe state 's general sales \\ttax rate is 4 % . \\nSales tax rates for cities and \\tcounties are also added to purchases . \\nFor example , the total sales tax rate in Mobile County , Alabama is 10 % and there is an additional restaurant tax \\tof 1 % , which means a diner in Mobile County , Alabama would pay an 11 % tax on a meal . \\nIn 2020 , sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted \\tfor 38 % of all state and local revenue . \\nOnly Alabama , Mississippi , and South Dakota tax \\tgroceries at the full state sales tax rate . \\nThe corporate income tax rate \\tin Alabama is 6.5 % . \\nThe overall federal , state , and local tax burden in Alabama \\tranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country . \\nProperty taxes of .40 % of assessed value per year \\t, are the second-lowest in the U.S. , after Hawaii . \\nThe current state constitution requires a \\tvoter referendum to raise property taxes . \\nCounty and \\tlocal governments . \\nAlabama has \\t67 counties . \\nEach county has its own elected legislative \\tbranch , usually called the county commission . \\nIt also has limited executive \\tauthority in the county . \\nBecause of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( Jefferson \\t, Lee , Mobile , Madison , Montgomery , Shelby , and Tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule . \\nInstead , most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state \\tlegislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning . \\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional \\tamendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission . \\nLegislative delegations retain certain \\tpowers over each county . \\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions in `` Baker v. Carr '' ( 1964 ) required that both houses have districts established on the \\tbasis of population , and redistricted after each census , to implement the principle of `` one man , one vote '' . \\nBefore that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading \\tto under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties . \\nThe rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , \\taffected politics well into the 20th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas . \\n`` The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation \\tof local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution . \\nAlabama 's constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one-third of \\tthe amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city . \\nA significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , \\ttaking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance . '' \\nAlabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning the \\tstate government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol . \\nThe Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale \\tand distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state . \\nA total of 25 of the 67 counties are `` dry counties '' which ban the \\tsale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War , Alabama was occupied by \\tfederal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope . \\nIn 1874 , the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government \\tfrom the Republicans , in part by suppressing the black vote through violence , fraud , and intimidation . \\nAfter 1890 , a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and \\tdisenfranchise African American residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution . \\nProvisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted \\tin excluding many poor Whites . \\nBy 1941 more Whites than Blacks had \\tbeen disenfranchised : 600,000 to 520,000 . \\nThe total effects were greater on the black community , as almost all its \\tcitizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law . \\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s , the state did not redraw election districts as \\tpopulation grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas . \\nAs counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly \\tthree-quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation . \\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement \\t, when whites bureaucratically , and at times violently , resisted protests for electoral and social reform . \\nGovernor George Wallace , the state 's only four-term governor \\t, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation . \\nOnly after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of \\t1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights . \\nIn many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large \\telectoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections . \\nSome changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to \\testablish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards . \\nIn 2007 , the Alabama Legislature passed , and Republican governor Bob Riley signed \\ta resolution expressing `` profound regret '' over slavery and its lingering impact . \\nIn a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the Alabama \\tState Capitol , which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America . \\nIn 2010 , Republicans won control of both houses of \\tthe legislature for the first time in 136 years . \\n, there are a total of 3,589,839 registered voters , with \\t3,518,285 active , and the others inactive in the state . \\nElections \\t. \\nIn a 2020 study , Alabama was ranked as \\tthe 12th most difficult state for citizens to vote . \\nState \\telections . \\nWith the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901 , the state became part of the `` Solid South '' , \\ta system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state . \\nFor nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the \\tDemocratic Party primary , with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election . \\nSince the mid- to late 20th century , however \\t, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party . \\nIn Alabama , majority-white districts are now expected to regularly \\telect Republican candidates to federal , state and local office . \\nMembers of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and \\tall ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office . \\nUntil 1994 , no Republicans held \\tany of the court seats . \\nIn that general election , the then-incumbent chief justice , Ernest C. Hornsby , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to \\tRepublican Perry O. Hooper Sr. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court . \\nThe Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August \\t2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench . \\nIn the early 21st century , Republicans hold all \\tseven of the statewide elected executive branch offices . \\nRepublicans hold six of the eight elected seats \\ton the Alabama State Board of Education . \\nIn 2010 , Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature \\t, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years . \\nThe last remaining statewide Democrat , who served on the \\tAlabama Public Service Commission , was defeated in 2012 . \\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction , when Republicans \\tgenerally represented Reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise . \\nThe three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom ( 1999–2003 ) , \\tKay Ivey ( 2011–2017 ) , and Will Ainsworth ( 2019–present ) . \\nLocal \\telections . \\nMany local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education \\t, tax assessors , tax collectors , etc . ) \\nin the state are \\tstill held by Democrats . \\nMany rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats , \\tresulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary . \\nSimilarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are \\teffectively decided in the Republican Primary , although there are exceptions . \\nAlabama 's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at-large races \\t, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts . \\nThe current split is 35 Democrats , \\t31 Republicans , and one Independent Fayette . \\nHowever , most of the Democratic sheriffs \\tpreside over rural and less populated counties . \\nThe majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected \\tin the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties . \\n, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff , \\tin Morgan County , Alabama , and ten African-American sheriffs . \\nFederal \\telections . \\nThe state 's two U.S. senators are Richard C. Shelby \\tand Tommy Tuberville , both of whom are Republican . \\nShelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected \\tin 1992 , but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election . \\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives , the state is represented by seven members , six of whom are Republicans : ( Jerry Carl , Mike Rogers , Robert Aderholt , Mo Brooks , \\tBarry Moore , and Gary Palmer ) and one Democrat : Terri Sewell , who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham , Tuscaloosa and Montgomery . \\nEducation \\t. \\nPrimary and \\tsecondary education . \\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of \\tEducation as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education . \\nTogether , 1,496 individual schools provide education \\tfor 744,637 elementary and secondary students . \\nPublic school funding is appropriated through the \\tAlabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund . \\nIn FY 2006–2007 , Alabama appropriated $ \\t3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education . \\nThat represented an increase of $ \\t444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year . \\nIn 2007 , more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress ( AYP ) toward student \\tproficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law , using measures determined by the state of Alabama . \\nWhile Alabama 's public education system has improved in recent decades \\t, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states . \\nAccording to U.S. Census data ( 2000 ) , Alabama 's high school graduation rate ( 75 \\t% ) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. ( after Kentucky , Louisiana and Mississippi ) . \\nThe largest educational gains were among people \\twith some college education but without degrees . \\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large , school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama , with 27,260 \\tpublic school students paddled at least one time , according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year . \\nThe rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama \\tis surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas . \\nColleges and \\tuniversities . \\nAlabama 's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities , \\ttwo-year community colleges , and 17 private , undergraduate and graduate universities . \\nIn the state are four medical schools ( as of fall 2015 ) ( University of Alabama School of Medicine , University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus ) , two veterinary colleges ( Auburn University and Tuskegee University ) , a dental school ( University of Alabama School \\tof Dentistry ) , an optometry college ( University of Alabama at Birmingham ) , two pharmacy schools ( Auburn University and Samford University ) , and five law schools ( University of Alabama School of Law , Birmingham School of Law , Cumberland School of Law , Miles Law School , and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law ) . \\nPublic , post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama \\tCommission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education . \\nColleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year \\tassociate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs . \\nThe largest single campus is the University of Alabama , \\tlocated in Tuscaloosa , with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016 . \\nTroy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010 , with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses ( Troy \\t, Dothan , Montgomery , and Phenix City ) , as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries . \\nThe oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and \\tthe Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile , both founded in 1830 . \\nAccreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools ( SACS ) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association \\tfor Biblical Higher Education ( ABHE ) , the Council on Occupational Education ( COE ) , and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools ( ACICS ) . \\nAccording to the 2011 `` U.S. News & amp ;

I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham , where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state \\tand I-20 continues east towards Atlanta ; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line , providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta ; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state , traveling from west to east through Mobile . \\nI-22 enters the state from Mississippi and \\tconnects Birmingham with Memphis , Tennessee . \\nIn addition , there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state : I-165 in Mobile , \\tI-359 in Tuscaloosa , I-459 around Birmingham , I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville , and I-759 in Gadsden . \\nA sixth route , I-685 , will be formed when \\tI-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery . \\nA proposed northern bypass of Birmingham \\twill be designated as I-422 . \\nSince a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not \\tbe possible , I-222 has been proposed , as well . \\nSeveral \\tU.S . \\nHighways also pass through the state , such as U.S. Route 11 ( US-11 ) , US-29 , US-31 , US-43 , US-45 , US-72 \\t, US-78 , US-80 , US-82 , US-84 , US-90 , US-98 , US-231 , US-278 , US-280 , US-331 , US-411 , and US-431 . \\nThere are four toll roads in the state : Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery ;

P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of `` \\t-λλ- '' and `` -λ- '' in epic language , which may account for a palatalized phoneme /ly/ in the original language . \\nDescription \\t. \\nIn the account of Dares the Phrygian , Achilles was described having `` . . \\t.a large chest , a fine mouth , and powerfully formed arms and legs . \\nHis head was covered with \\tlong wavy chestnut-colored hair . \\nThough mild in manner , he \\twas very fierce in battle . \\nHis face showed the joy of \\ta man richly endowed . '' \\nBirth and \\tearly years . \\nAchilles was the son of Thetis , a Nereid and daughter of The Old \\tMan of the Sea , and Peleus , the king of the Myrmidons . \\nZeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetis 's hand in marriage until Prometheus , the fore-thinker , warned Zeus of a \\tprophecy ( originally uttered by Themis , goddess of divine law ) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father . \\nFor this reason , the two gods withdrew \\ttheir pursuit , and had her wed Peleus . \\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : In the `` Argonautica '' ( 4.760 ) Zeus ' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis \\t' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus , pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera 's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods . \\nThetis , although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus , was also brought \\tup by Hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus . \\nZeus was furious and decreed that \\tshe would never marry an immortal . \\nAccording to the `` Achilleid '' , written by Statius in the 1st century AD , and to non-surviving previous sources , when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him \\timmortal by dipping him in the river Styx ; however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him : his left heel . \\nIt is not clear if this \\tversion of events was known earlier . \\nIn another version of this story , Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him \\ton top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body . \\nShe was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned \\tboth father and son in a rage . \\nNone of the sources before Statius make \\tany reference to this general invulnerability . \\nTo the contrary , in the `` Iliad '' , Homer mentions Achilles being wounded : in \\tBook 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus , son of Pelagon , challenged Achilles by the river Scamander . \\nHe was ambidextrous , and cast a spear from each hand ; one \\tgrazed Achilles ' elbow , `` drawing a spurt of blood '' . \\nIn the few fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle \\twhich describe the hero 's death ( i.e . \\nthe `` Cypria '' , the `` Little Iliad '' by Lesches of Pyrrha , the `` Aithiopis '' and `` Iliou persis '' \\tby Arctinus of Miletus ) , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel . \\nIn the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles , the \\tarrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his torso . \\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur , who \\tlived on Mount Pelion , to be reared . \\nThetis foretold that her son 's fate was either to gain glory and \\tdie young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity . \\nAchilles chose the former , and decided \\tto take part in the Trojan War . \\nAccording to Homer , Achilles grew up \\tin Phthia with his companion Patroclus . \\nAccording to Photius , the sixth book of the `` New History '' by Ptolemy \\tHephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus . \\nWhen she had Achilles , Peleus noticed , tore him from the flames \\twith only a burnt foot , and confided him to the centaur Chiron . \\nLater Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus , who was the fastest of all \\tthe giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into Achilles ' burnt foot . \\nOther \\tnames . \\nAmong the appellations under which Achilles is generally \\tknown are the following : Hidden on Skyros . \\nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war , Thetis ( or , in some versions , Peleus \\t) hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of Lycomedes , king of Skyros . \\nThere , Achilles , properly disguised , lived among Lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name \\t`` Pyrrha '' ( the red-haired girl ) , Cercysera or Aissa ( `` swift '' ) . \\nWith Lycomedes ' daughter Deidamia , whom in the account of Statius he raped , Achilles there fathered \\ttwo sons , Neoptolemus ( also called Pyrrhus , after his father 's possible alias ) and Oneiros . \\nAccording to this story , Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that \\tthe Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles ' aid . \\nOdysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women 's \\tclothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods . \\nWhen Achilles instantly took up the spear , Odysseus saw through \\this disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign . \\nIn another version of the story , Odysseus arranged for a trumpet \\talarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes ' women . \\nWhile the women fled in panic , Achilles prepared to \\tdefend the court , thus giving his identity away . \\nIn the \\tTrojan War . \\nAccording to the `` Iliad '' , Achilles arrived at \\tTroy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 Myrmidons . \\nHe appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons ) \\t: Menesthius , Eudorus , Peisander , Phoenix and Alcimedon . \\nTelephus \\t. \\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War , they \\taccidentally stopped in Mysia , ruled by King Telephus . \\nIn the resulting battle , Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal ; \\tTelephus consulted an oracle , who stated that `` he that wounded shall heal '' . \\nGuided by the oracle , he arrived at Argos , where Achilles healed him \\tin order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy . \\nAccording to other reports in Euripides ' lost play about Telephus , he went \\tto Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound . \\nAchilles refused , claiming to \\thave no medical knowledge . \\nAlternatively , Telephus held Orestes for ransom , the \\transom being Achilles ' aid in healing the wound . \\nOdysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; \\ttherefore , the spear must be able to heal it . \\nPieces of the spear were scraped off \\tonto the wound and Telephus was healed . \\nTroilus \\t. \\nAccording to the `` Cypria '' ( the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles ' wrath ) , when the Achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by Achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas , sacked neighbouring cities ( like Pedasus and Lyrnessus , where the Greeks \\tcapture the queen Briseis ) and killed Tenes , a son of Apollo , as well as Priam 's son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios ; however , the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer 's `` Troilus and Criseyde '' and in William Shakespeare 's `` Troilus and Cressida '' is a medieval invention . \\nIn Dares Phrygius ' `` Account of the Destruction of Troy '' , the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe , as well as in older \\taccounts , Troilus was a young Trojan prince , the youngest of King Priam 's and Hecuba 's five legitimate sons ( or according other sources , another son of Apollo ) . \\nDespite his youth , he was one of the main Trojan war leaders , \\ta `` horse fighter '' or `` chariot fighter '' according to Homer . \\nProphecies linked Troilus ' fate to that of Troy and \\tso he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him . \\nYet Achilles , struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his \\tsexual attentions on the youth – who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios . \\nLater versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally \\tkilled by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers ' embrace . \\nIn this version of the myth , Achilles ' \\tdeath therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege . \\nAncient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of \\ta dead child mourned by his parents . \\nHad Troilus lived to adulthood , the First Vatican Mythographer claimed , Troy would have been invincible \\t; however , the motif is older and found already in Plautus ' `` Bacchides '' . \\nIn the `` \\tIliad '' . \\nHomer 's `` Iliad '' is the most famous \\tnarrative of Achilles ' deeds in the Trojan War . \\nAchilles ' wrath ( μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως , `` mênis Achilléōs \\t'' ) is the central theme of the poem . \\nThe first two lines of the `` Iliad '' read : The Homeric epic only covers \\ta few weeks of the decade-long war , and does not narrate Achilles ' death . \\nIt begins with Achilles ' withdrawal from battle after being \\tdishonoured by Agamemnon , the commander of the Achaean forces . \\nAgamemnon has taken a woman \\tnamed Chryseis as his slave . \\nHer father Chryses , a priest of Apollo \\t, begs Agamemnon to return her to him . \\nAgamemnon refuses , and Apollo sends \\ta plague amongst the Greeks . \\nThe prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles \\tbut will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him . \\nAchilles does so , and Calchas declares that \\tChryseis must be returned to her father . \\nAgamemnon consents , but then commands that Achilles ' battle prize Briseis , \\tthe daughter of Briseus , be brought to him to replace Chryseis . \\nAngry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves Briseis \\t) , with the urging of his mother Thetis , Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces . \\nAt the same time , burning with rage over Agamemnon 's theft , Achilles prays to Thetis to convince \\tZeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour . \\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks , thanks to the influence of Zeus , Nestor declares that \\tthe Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior . \\nAgamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two \\tother chieftains , Ajax and Phoenix . \\nThey promise that , if Achilles returns to battle , \\tAgamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts . \\nAchilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the \\tGreeks to sail home as he was planning to do . \\nThe Trojans , led by Hector , subsequently push the Greek \\tarmy back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships . \\nWith the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , Patroclus leads the Myrmidons \\tinto battle , wearing Achilles ' armour , though Achilles remains at his camp . \\nPatroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches , but is killed \\tby Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy . \\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus , the \\tson of Nestor , Achilles grieves over his beloved companion 's death . \\nHis mother Thetis comes to \\tcomfort the distraught Achilles . \\nShe persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him , in place of \\tthe armour that Patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by Hector . \\nThe new armour includes the Shield of Achilles \\t, described in great detail in the poem . \\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus , Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes \\tthe field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector . \\nAchilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander , who has become \\tangry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed . \\nThe god tries to drown Achilles but \\tis stopped by Hera and Hephaestus . \\nZeus himself takes note of Achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack \\tTroy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself . \\nFinally , Achilles \\tfinds his prey . \\nAchilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena , in the form of Hector 's \\tfavorite and dearest brother , Deiphobus , persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face . \\nAfter Hector realizes the trick , \\the knows the battle is inevitable . \\nWanting to go down fighting , he charges at Achilles \\twith his only weapon , his sword , but misses . \\nAccepting his fate , Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life \\t, but to treat his body with respect after killing him . \\nAchilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that `` my rage , my fury would \\tdrive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me '' . \\nAchilles then kills Hector and drags his \\tcorpse by its heels behind his chariot . \\nAfter having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral , \\tAchilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion . \\nAt the onset of his duel with Hector , Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky \\t, which comes on in the autumn , Orion 's dog ( Sirius ) ; a sign of evil . \\nDuring the cremation of Patroclus , he is compared to Hesperus , the evening/western star ( Venus ) , while the \\tburning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus , the morning/eastern star ( also Venus ) has set ( descended ) . \\nWith the assistance of the god Hermes ( Argeiphontes ) , Hector 's father Priam goes to Achilles ' \\ttent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector 's body so that he can be buried . \\nAchilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral , lasting 9 days \\twith a burial on the 10th ( in the tradition of Niobe 's offspring ) . \\nThe poem ends with a description of Hector 's funeral , \\twith the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come . \\nLater epic accounts : \\tfighting Penthesilea and Memnon . \\nThe `` Aethiopis '' ( 7th century BC ) and a work named `` Posthomerica '' , composed \\tby Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century CE , relate further events from the Trojan War . \\nWhen Penthesilea , queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares , \\tarrives in Troy , Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles . \\nAfter his temporary truce with Priam , Achilles fights and kills \\tthe warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later . \\nAt first , he was so distracted by her beauty \\t, he did not fight as intensely as usual . \\nOnce he realized that his distraction was endangering \\this life , he refocused and killed her . \\nFollowing the death of Patroclus , Nestor 's \\tson Antilochus becomes Achilles ' closest companion . \\nWhen Memnon , son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia , \\tslays Antilochus , Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing Memnon . \\nConsequently , Eos will not let the \\tsun rise until Zeus persuades her . \\nThe fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus \\t, except that Memnon ( unlike Hector ) was also the son of a goddess . \\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the `` Iliad '' \\ts description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles ' reaction to it . \\nThe episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic `` Aethiopis '' , which \\twas composed after the `` Iliad '' , possibly in the 7th century BC . \\nThe `` Aethiopis '' is now lost , \\texcept for scattered fragments quoted by later authors . \\nAchilles and \\tPatroclus . \\nThe exact nature of Achilles ' relationship with Patroclus has been a \\tsubject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times . \\nIn the `` Iliad '' , it appears to \\tbe the model of a deep and loyal friendship . \\nHomer does not suggest that Achilles and \\this close friend Patroclus had sexual relations . \\nAlthough there is no direct evidence in the text of the `` Iliad '' that \\tAchilles and Patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors . \\nCommentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted \\tthe relationship through the lens of their own cultures . \\nIn 5th-century BC Athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of `` \\tpaiderasteia '' , which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one , usually a teenager . \\nIn Patroclus and Achilles ' case , Achilles would have been \\tthe younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder . \\nIn Plato 's `` Symposium '' , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple \\t; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover . \\nHowever , ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was \\tassumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women . \\nMany pairs of men throughout history have been compared \\tto Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship . \\nDeath \\t. \\nThe death of Achilles , even if considered solely as it occurred in \\tthe oldest sources , is a complex one , with many different versions . \\nStarting with the oldest account , In the `` Iliad Book XXII '' , Hector predicts with his last dying breath that Paris \\tand Apollo will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy ( with an arrow to the heel according to Statius ) . \\n`` In Book XXIII '' , the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber \\t, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase , a gift of his mother . \\nIn the `` Odyssey Book XI '' , Odysseus \\tsails to the underworld and converses with the shades . \\nOne of these is Achilles , who when greeted as `` blessed in life , blessed in death '' , \\tresponds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead . \\nBut Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son 's exploits in the Trojan war , \\tand when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus ' heroic actions , Achilles is filled with satisfaction . \\nIn the `` Odyssey Book XXIV '' we read dead King Agamemnon 's ghostly account of his death : Achilles \\t' funeral pyre bleached bones had been mixed with those of Patroclus and put into his mother 's golden vase . \\nAlso , the bones of Antilocus , who had become closer to \\tAchilles than any other following Patroclus ' death , were separately enclosed . \\nAnd , the customary funeral games of a hero were performed , and a \\tmassive tomb or mound was built on the Hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate . \\nAchilles was represented in the `` Aethiopis '' as living after his death \\tin the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube . \\nAnother version of Achilles ' death is that he fell deeply \\tin love with one of the Trojan princesses , Polyxena . \\nAchilles asks Priam for Polyxena \\t's hand in marriage . \\nPriam is willing because it would mean the end of the \\twar and an alliance with the world 's greatest warrior . \\nBut while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles , Paris , who would have to give up \\tHelen if Achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow , killing him . \\nAccording to some accounts , he had married Medea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in \\tthe Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius ' `` Argonautica '' ( 3rd century BC ) . \\nFate of Achilles \\t' armour . \\nAchilles ' armour was the object of a feud between \\tOdysseus and Telamonian Ajax ( Ajax the greater ) . \\nThey competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners \\t, who , after considering both men 's presentations , decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour . \\nFurious , Ajax cursed Odysseus , which earned him the ire of Athena , who temporarily made \\tAjax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades . \\nAfter a while , when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he \\thad actually been killing sheep , he was so ashamed that he committed suicide . \\nOdysseus eventually gave the armour to \\tNeoptolemus , the son of Achilles . \\nWhen Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades ( `` Odyssey '' 11.543–566 ) \\t, Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus . \\nThe armour they fought for was made by Hephaestus thus making it \\tmuch stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft . \\nHe was made the gear because his first set was worn by Patroclus \\twhen he went to battle and taken by Hector when he killed Patroclus . \\nThe Shield of Achilles was also \\tmade by the fire god . \\nHis legendary spear was given to him by his \\tmentor Chiron before he participated in the Trojan War . \\nIt was called the Pelian Spear which \\tallegedly no other man could wield . \\nA relic claimed to be Achilles ' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple \\tof Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis , Lycia , a port on the Pamphylian Gulf . \\nThe city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great , who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the `` Iliad '' with him \\t, but his court biographers do not mention the spear ; however , it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century CE . \\nAchilles , Ajax and a \\tgame of `` petteia '' . \\nNumerous paintings on pottery have suggested a \\ttale not mentioned in the literary traditions . \\nAt some point in the war , Achilles and Ajax \\twere playing a board game ( `` petteia '' ) . \\nThey were absorbed in the game \\tand oblivious to the surrounding battle . \\nThe Trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who \\twere saved only by an intervention of Athena . \\nWorship and \\theroic cult . \\nThe tomb of Achilles , extant throughout antiquity in Troad , was venerated by Thessalians , but also \\tby Persian expeditionary forces , as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla . \\nAchilles ' cult was also to be found at other places , e. g. on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades , in Sparta which had a sanctuary , in Elis \\tand in Achilles ' homeland Thessaly , as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum , Locri and Croton , accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero . \\nThe cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BC Polyxena sarcophagus \\t, which depicts the sacrifice of Polyxena near the tumulus of Achilles . \\nStrabo ( 13.1.32 ) also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad : The spread and intensity of the hero 's veneration \\tamong the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus , today 's Black Sea , appears to have been remarkable . \\nAn archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the \\tBlack Sea , today identified with Snake Island ( Ukrainian Зміїний , `` Zmiinyi '' , near Kiliya , Ukraine ) . \\nEarly dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea ( graffiti and inscribed clay disks , these possibly being votive offerings , from Olbia \\t, the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese ) attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards . \\nThe cult was still thriving in the third century CE , when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an `` Achilles Pontárchēs '' ( Ποντάρχης , roughly `` lord of the Sea , '' or `` of \\tthe Pontus Euxinus '' ) , who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia , venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates , Hermes Agoraeus , or Poseidon . \\nPliny the Elder ( 23–79 AD ) in his `` Natural History '' mentions a `` port of the Achæi '' and an `` island of Achilles '' , famous for the tomb of that `` man '' ( ) , situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper-Bug Estuary ; furthermore , at 125 Roman miles \\tfrom this island , he places a peninsula `` which stretches forth in the shape of a sword '' obliquely , called `` Dromos Achilleos '' ( Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος , `` Achilléōs drómos '' `` the Race-course of Achilles '' ) and considered the place of the hero 's exercise or of games instituted by him . \\nThis last feature of Pliny 's account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today `` Tendra '' ( or `` Kosa Tendra '' and `` Kosa Djarilgatch '' ) \\t, situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay , but which is hardly 125 Roman miles ( km ) away from the Dnieper-Bug estuary , as Pliny states . \\n( To the `` Race-course '' he gives a length of 80 \\tmiles , km , whereas the spit measures km today . ) \\nIn the following chapter of his book , Pliny refers to the same island as `` Achillea '' and introduces two further names for \\tit : `` Leuce '' or `` Macaron '' ( from Greek [ νῆσος ] μακαρῶν `` island of the blest '' ) . \\nThe `` present day '' measures , he gives at this point , seem to account \\tfor an identification of `` Achillea '' or `` Leuce '' with today 's Snake Island . \\nPliny 's contemporary Pomponius Mela ( ) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named `` \\tAchillea '' , situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister , adding to the geographical confusion . \\nRuins of a square temple , measuring 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated \\tto Achilles , were discovered by Captain Kritzikly ( ) in 1823 on Snake Island . \\nA second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of \\ta lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple . \\nA fifth century BC black-glazed lekythos inscription , found on the island in 1840 , reads : \\t`` Glaukos , son of Poseidon , dedicated me to Achilles , lord of Leuke . '' \\nIn another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC , a statue is dedicated to Achilles , lord of Leuke , by a citizen of Olbia , while in \\ta further dedication , the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island 's cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration . \\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on `` Leuce '' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic `` Aethiopis '' according to which , after \\this untimely death , Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical ( `` Leúkē Nêsos '' `` White Island '' ) . \\nAlready in the fifth century BC , Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a `` bright island '' ( φαεννά νᾶσος , `` phaenná nâsos '' ) of the Black Sea , while \\tin another of his works , Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus . \\nWell known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles ( μακαρῶν νῆσοι , `` makárôn nêsoi '' ) or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus \\twhich according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it . \\nGuy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus , speaking of `` Achilles lord of Scythia '' and the \\topposition of North and South , as evoked by Achilles ' fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death . \\nThe `` Periplus of the Euxine Sea '' ( ) gives the following details : The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes , who likely lived during \\tthe first century CE , wrote that the island was called `` Leuce '' `` because the wild animals which live there are white . \\nIt is said that there , in Leuce island , reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of \\tthis island ; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour '' . \\nSimilarly , others relate the island 's name to \\tits white cliffs , snakes or birds dwelling there . \\nPausanias has been told that the island is `` covered with \\tforests and full of animals , some wild , some tame . \\nIn this island there is also Achilles \\t' temple and his statue '' . \\nLeuce had also a reputation \\tas a place of healing . \\nPausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord \\tof Croton to be cured of a chest wound . \\nAmmianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters ( \\t`` aquae '' ) on the island . \\nStrabo mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to \\tAchilles and although it was treeless , was called Alsos ( ἄλσος ) . \\n`` Alsos '' in Greek \\tmeans `` grove '' . \\nA number of important commercial port cities of \\tthe Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles . \\nHerodotus , Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town `` Achílleion '' ( Ἀχίλλειον ) , built \\tby settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC , close to the hero 's presumed burial mound in the Troad . \\nLater attestations point to an `` Achílleion '' in Messenia ( according to \\tStephanus Byzantinus ) and an `` Achílleios '' ( Ἀχίλλειος ) in Laconia . \\nNicolae Densuşianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta , called Chilia ( presumably from \\tan older `` Achileii '' ) , though his conclusion , that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea , evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law . \\nThe kings of Epirus claimed to be descended \\tfrom Achilles through his son , Neoptolemus . \\nAlexander the Great , son of the Epirote princess Olympias , could therefore also claim \\tthis descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor . \\nHe is said to have visited the tomb \\tof Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy . \\nIn AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla , while on his way to \\twar against Parthia , emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles ' tumulus . \\nReception during \\tantiquity . \\nIn Greek \\ttragedy . \\nThe Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles \\t, given the title `` Achilleis '' by modern scholars . \\nThe tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War , including his defeat of Hector \\tand eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel . \\nExtant fragments of the `` Achilleis '' and other Aeschylean \\tfragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play . \\nThe first part of the `` Achilleis '' trilogy , `` The Myrmidons '' , focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus , \\twho represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today . \\nIn Plato 's `` Symposium '' , Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved ; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because \\tAchilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him . \\nThe tragedian Sophocles also wrote `` The Lovers of Achilles \\t'' , a play with Achilles as the main character . \\nOnly a few \\tfragments survive . \\nTowards the end of the 5th century BC , a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama ; Euripides refers to \\tAchilles in a bitter or ironic tone in `` Hecuba '' , `` Electra '' , and `` Iphigenia in Aulis '' . \\nIn Greek \\tphilosophy . \\nZeno \\t. \\nThe philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between `` swift-footed '' Achilles and a tortoise , by which he \\tattempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible . \\nAs a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the \\tEleatic school , Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions . \\nPlato \\t. \\nIn `` Hippias Minor '' , a dialogue attributed to \\tPlato , an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates . \\nThe two get into \\ta discussion about lying . \\nThey decide that a person who is intentionally false must be `` better '' than a person who is unintentionally \\tfalse , on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying . \\nSocrates uses various analogies , discussing athletics \\tand the sciences to prove his point . \\nThe two also \\treference Homer extensively . \\nSocrates and Hippias agree that Odysseus , who concocted a number of lies throughout the \\t`` Odyssey '' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle , was false intentionally . \\nAchilles , like Odysseus \\t, told numerous falsehoods . \\nHippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man , \\twhile Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit . \\nThe two argue over whether it is better \\tto lie on purpose or by accident . \\nSocrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point : someone \\twho does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally . \\nIn Roman and \\tmedieval literature . \\nThe Romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to \\tTroy , took a highly negative view of Achilles . \\nVirgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of \\tmen , while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children . \\nOther writers , such as Catullus , Propertius , and Ovid , represent a \\tsecond strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on Achilles ' erotic career . \\nThis strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure 's `` Roman de Troie '' \\tand Guido delle Colonne 's `` Historia destructionis Troiae '' , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century . \\nAchilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon , not as Hellene , but as Scythian , while according to \\tthe Byzantine author John Malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars . \\nIn modern literature \\tand arts . \\nMusic \\t. \\nAchilles has been frequently the subject of \\toperas , ballets and related genres . \\nFilm and \\ttelevision . \\nIn films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series : < /doc > < doc id= '' 306 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=306 '' title= '' AppliedStatistics '' > AppliedStatistics < /doc > < doc id= '' 307 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki \\t? curid=307 '' title= '' Abraham Lincoln '' > Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln ( ; February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was an American lawyer , politician , and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865 . \\nLincoln led the nation through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union \\t, abolishing slavery , bolstering the federal government , and modernizing the U.S. economy . \\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky \\tand was raised on the frontier , primarily in Indiana . \\nHe was self-educated and became a lawyer , Whig \\tParty leader , Illinois state legislator , and U.S . \\nCongressman from \\tIllinois . \\nIn 1849 , he returned to his \\tsuccessful law practice in central Illinois . \\nIn 1854 , he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act , \\twhich opened the territories to slavery , and he re-entered politics . \\nHe soon became a leader \\tof the new Republican Party . \\nHe reached a national audience in the 1858 \\tSenate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas . \\nLincoln ran for president in 1860 , \\tsweeping the North to gain victory . \\nPro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat \\tto slavery , and Southern states began seceding from the Union . \\nDuring this time , the newly formed Confederate States of \\tAmerica began seizing federal military bases in the south . \\nJust over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency , the Confederate \\tStates attacked Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in South Carolina . \\nFollowing the bombardment , Lincoln mobilized forces to \\tsuppress the rebellion and restore the Union . \\nLincoln , a moderate Republican , had to navigate a contentious array of \\tfactions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties . \\nHis allies , the War Democrats and the Radical \\tRepublicans , demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates . \\nAnti-war Democrats ( called `` Copperheads '' ) despised \\tLincoln , and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination . \\nHe managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity , carefully \\tdistributing political patronage , and by appealing to the American people . \\nHis Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of \\tthe greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose . \\nLincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort , including the \\tselection of generals , and implemented a naval blockade of the South 's trade . \\nHe suspended `` habeas corpus '' in Maryland and elsewhere , and \\the averted British intervention by defusing the `` Trent '' Affair . \\nIn 1863 , he issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which declared the \\tslaves in the states `` in rebellion '' to be free . \\nIt also directed the Army and Navy to `` recognize and maintain the freedom of such \\tpersons '' and to receive them `` into the armed service of the United States . '' \\nLincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery , and he promoted the Thirteenth \\tAmendment to the United States Constitution , which upon its ratification abolished slavery . \\nLincoln managed his own \\tsuccessful re-election campaign . \\nHe sought to heal the \\twar-torn nation through reconciliation . \\nOn April 14 , 1865 , just five days after the war 's end at Appomattox , he was attending a play at \\tFord 's Theatre in Washington , D.C. , with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth . \\nLincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime \\tleadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery . \\nLincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly \\tpolls as the greatest president in American history . \\nFamily and \\tchildhood . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12 , 1809 , the second child of Thomas Lincoln and \\tNancy Hanks Lincoln , in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville , Kentucky . \\nHe was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln , an Englishman who migrated from Hingham \\t, Norfolk , to its namesake , Hingham , Massachusetts , in 1638 . \\nThe family then migrated west , passing through \\tNew Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . \\nLincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia ; his paternal grandfather and namesake , Captain \\tAbraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba ( née Herring ) moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County , Kentucky . \\nThe captain was killed in \\tan Indian raid in 1786 . \\nHis children , including eight-year-old Thomas , \\tAbraham 's father , witnessed the attack . \\nThomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the \\tfamily settled in Hardin County , Kentucky , in the early 1800s . \\nThe heritage of Lincoln 's mother Nancy remains unclear , but it \\tis widely assumed that she was the daughter of Lucy Hanks . \\nThomas and Nancy married on June 12 , 1806 , \\tin Washington County , and moved to Elizabethtown , Kentucky . \\nThey had three children : Sarah , Abraham , \\tand Thomas , who died as an infant . \\nThomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all \\tbut of his land in court disputes over property titles . \\nIn 1816 , the family moved to Indiana where \\tthe land surveys and titles were more reliable . \\nIndiana was a `` free '' ( non-slaveholding ) territory , and they settled \\tin an `` unbroken forest '' in Hurricane Township , Perry County , Indiana . \\nIn 1860 , Lincoln noted that the family 's move to Indiana was `` \\tpartly on account of slavery '' , but mainly due to land title difficulties . \\nIn Kentucky and Indiana , Thomas worked as \\ta farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter . \\nAt various times , he owned farms , livestock , and town lots , paid \\ttaxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , and served on county patrols . \\nThomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptists church \\t, which forbade alcohol , dancing , and slavery . \\nOvercoming financial challenges , Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to in \\tIndiana , an area which became the Little Pigeon Creek Community . \\nMother 's \\tdeath . \\nOn October 5 , 1818 , Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness , leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of \\ta household including her father , 9-year-old Abraham , and Nancy 's 19-year-old orphan cousin , Dennis Hanks . \\nTen years later , on January 20 , 1828 , Sarah \\tdied while giving birth to a stillborn son , devastating Lincoln . \\nOn December 2 , 1819 , Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston , a \\twidow from Elizabethtown , Kentucky , with three children of her own . \\nAbraham became close to his stepmother \\tand called her `` Mother '' . \\nLincoln disliked the hard labor \\tassociated with farm life . \\nHis family even said he was lazy , for all his `` reading \\t, scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing Poetry , etc . `` . \\nHis stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy `` \\tphysical labor '' , but loved to read . \\nEducation and move \\tto Illinois . \\nLincoln was \\tlargely self-educated . \\nHis formal schooling was \\tfrom itinerant teachers . \\nIt included two short stints in Kentucky , where he learned to read but probably not to write , at age seven , and in Indiana , \\twhere he went to school sporadically due to farm chores , for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15 . \\nHe persisted as an avid reader and \\tretained a lifelong interest in learning . \\nFamily , neighbors , and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the King James Bible , Aesop 's Fables , John Bunyan 's \\t`` The Pilgrim 's Progress '' , Daniel Defoe 's `` Robinson Crusoe '' , and `` The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin '' . \\nAs a teen , Lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his \\tfather all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21 . \\nLincoln was tall , strong , and athletic \\t, and became adept at using an ax . \\nHe was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in \\tthe rough catch-as-catch-can style ( also known as catch wrestling ) . \\nHe became county wrestling champion \\tat the age of 21 . \\nHe gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with \\tthe renowned leader of ruffians known as `` the Clary 's Grove Boys '' . \\nIn March 1830 , fearing another milk sickness outbreak , several members of the extended Lincoln family , \\tincluding Abraham , moved west to Illinois , a free state , and settled in Macon County . \\nAbraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas , in \\tpart due to his father 's lack of education . \\nIn 1831 , as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a new \\thomestead in Coles County , Illinois , Abraham struck out on his own . \\nHe made his home in New Salem \\t, Illinois , for six years . \\nLincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to New Orleans \\t, Louisiana , where he was first exposed to slavery . \\nIn 1865 , Lincoln was asked how \\the came to acquire his rhetorical skills . \\nHe answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across \\tthe word `` demonstrate '' but had insufficient understanding of the term . \\nSo , he left Springfield for his father 's home to study until he `` could give any proposition \\tin the six books of Euclid [ here , referencing Euclid 's `` Elements '' ] at sight . '' \\nMarriage and \\tchildren . \\nLincoln 's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge , \\twhom he met when he moved to New Salem . \\nBy 1835 , they were in \\ta relationship but not formally engaged . \\nShe died on August 25 , 1835 \\t, most likely of typhoid fever . \\nIn the early 1830s , he \\tmet Mary Owens from Kentucky . \\nLate in 1836 , Lincoln agreed to a match \\twith Owens if she returned to New Salem . \\nOwens arrived that November and he courted her for a \\ttime ; however , they both had second thoughts . \\nOn August 16 , 1837 , he wrote Owens a letter saying he would \\tnot blame her if she ended the relationship , and she never replied . \\nIn 1839 , Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield , \\tIllinois , and the following year they became engaged . \\nShe was the daughter of Robert Smith Todd , \\ta wealthy lawyer and businessman in Lexington , Kentucky . \\nA wedding set for January 1 , 1841 , was canceled at Lincoln 's request , but they \\treconciled and married on November 4 , 1842 , in the Springfield mansion of Mary 's sister . \\nWhile anxiously preparing for the nuptials , he was asked where he \\twas going and replied , `` To hell , I suppose . '' \\nIn 1844 , the couple bought a \\thouse in Springfield near his law office . \\nMary kept house with the help of \\ta hired servant and a relative . \\nLincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons \\t, though his work regularly kept him away from home . \\nThe oldest , Robert Todd Lincoln , was born in \\t1843 and was the only child to live to maturity . \\nEdward Baker Lincoln ( Eddie ) , born in 1846 \\t, died February 1 , 1850 , probably of tuberculosis . \\nLincoln 's third son , `` Willie '' Lincoln was born on December 21 , 1850 \\t, and died of a fever at the White House on February 20 , 1862 . \\nThe youngest , Thomas `` Tad '' Lincoln , was born on April 4 , 1853 , \\tand survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16 , 1871 . \\nLincoln `` was remarkably fond of children '' and the \\tLincolns were not considered to be strict with their own . \\nIn fact , Lincoln 's law partner William H. Herndon would \\tgrow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office . \\nTheir father , it seemed , was often too absorbed \\tin his work to notice his children 's behavior . \\nHerndon recounted , `` I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring \\ttheir little necks , and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut . \\nLincoln did not note what his children \\twere doing or had done . '' \\nThe deaths of their sons , Eddie and \\tWillie , had profound effects on both parents . \\nLincoln suffered from `` melancholy '' , a \\tcondition now thought to be clinical depression . \\nLater in life , Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and \\tsons , and Robert committed her for a time to an asylum in 1875 . \\nEarly career and \\tmilitia service . \\nDuring 1831 and 1832 , Lincoln worked at \\ta general store in New Salem , Illinois . \\nIn 1832 , he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives , but interrupted \\this campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War . \\nWhen Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War , he planned to become a blacksmith , but instead formed \\ta partnership with William Berry , 21 , with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit . \\nBecause a license was required to sell customers single beverages , Berry obtained bartending licenses for $ 7 \\teach for Lincoln and himself , and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well . \\nAs licensed bartenders , Lincoln and Berry were able to sell \\tspirits , including liquor , for 12 cents a pint . \\nThey offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages \\tas well as food , including takeout dinners . \\nBut Berry became an alcoholic , was often too drunk to \\twork , and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself . \\nAlthough the economy was booming , the business struggled and \\twent into debt , causing Lincoln to sell his share . \\nIn his first campaign speech after returning from his military service , Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under \\tattack , grabbed the assailant by his `` neck and the seat of his trousers '' , and tossed him . \\nIn the campaign , Lincoln advocated for \\tnavigational improvements on the Sangamon River . \\nHe could draw crowds as a raconteur , but lacked the requisite formal \\teducation , powerful friends , and money , and lost the election . \\nLincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , \\tthough he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct . \\nLincoln served as New Salem 's postmaster and later as county surveyor \\t, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer . \\nRather than studying in the office of an established attorney , as was the custom , Lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys John Todd Stuart \\tand Thomas Drummond , purchased books including Blackstone 's `` Commentaries '' and Chitty 's `` Pleadings '' , and read law on his own . \\nHe later said of his legal education \\tthat `` I studied with nobody . '' \\nIllinois state legislature \\t( 1834–1842 ) . \\nLincoln 's second state house campaign in 1834 , this time as \\ta Whig , was a success over a powerful Whig opponent . \\nThen followed his four terms in the \\tIllinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County . \\nHe championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan \\tCanal , and later was a Canal Commissioner . \\nHe voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males , \\tbut adopted a `` free soil '' stance opposing both slavery and abolition . \\nIn 1837 , he declared , `` [ The ] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and \\tbad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . '' \\nHe echoed Henry Clay 's support for the American Colonization Society which advocated \\ta program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia . \\nHe was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836 , and moved to Springfield \\tand began to practice law under John T. Stuart , Mary Todd 's cousin . \\nLincoln emerged as a formidable trial \\tcombatant during cross-examinations and closing arguments . \\nHe partnered several years with Stephen T. Logan , and in 1844 began \\this practice with William Herndon , `` a studious young man '' . \\nU.S. House of Representatives \\t( 1847–1849 ) . \\nTrue to his record , Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \\t`` an old line Whig , a disciple of Henry Clay '' . \\nTheir party favored economic modernization in banking , tariffs \\tto fund internal improvements including railroads , and urbanization . \\nIn 1843 , Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois ' 7th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives \\t; he was defeated by John J. Hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term . \\nLincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining \\tthe nomination in 1846 but also won the election . \\nHe was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation , but as dutiful as \\tany participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line . \\nHe was assigned to the Committee on Post Office and Post \\tRoads and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department . \\nLincoln teamed with Joshua R. Giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with \\tcompensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter . \\nHe dropped the bill when \\tit eluded Whig support . \\nPolitical \\tviews . \\nOn foreign and military policy , Lincoln spoke against the Mexican–American War , which he imputed to President James \\tK. Polk 's desire for `` military glory—that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood '' . \\nHe supported the Wilmot Proviso , a failed proposal to \\tban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico . \\nLincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by \\tdrafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions . \\nThe war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico , and Polk insisted \\tthat Mexican soldiers had `` invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil . '' \\nLincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood \\thad been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil . \\nThe resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers \\t, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district . \\nOne Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed \\thim `` spotty Lincoln '' . \\nLincoln later regretted some of his statements , \\tespecially his attack on presidential war-making powers . \\nLincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve \\tonly one term in the House . \\nRealizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency , he supported General \\tZachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . \\nTaylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to \\tbe appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office . \\nThe administration offered to appoint him secretary or \\tgovernor of the Oregon Territory as consolation . \\nThis distant territory was a Democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have disrupted \\this legal and political career in Illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice . \\nPrairie \\tlawyer . \\nIn his Springfield practice , Lincoln handled `` every kind \\tof business that could come before a prairie lawyer '' . \\nTwice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats \\tin the Midstate county courts ; this continued for 16 years . \\nLincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation 's western \\texpansion , particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges . \\nAs a riverboat man , Lincoln initially favored those \\tinterests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him . \\nHe later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in `` Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge \\tCompany '' , a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge . \\nIn 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation \\tdevice for the movement of boats in shallow water . \\nThe idea was never commercialized , but it made \\tLincoln the only president to hold a patent . \\nLincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases ; he was sole \\tcounsel in 51 cases , of which 31 were decided in his favor . \\nFrom 1853 to 1860 , one of his \\tlargest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad . \\nHis legal reputation gave rise to \\tthe nickname `` Honest Abe '' . \\nLincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial , defending William `` Duff '' \\tArmstrong , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker . \\nThe case is famous for Lincoln 's use of a fact \\testablished by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness . \\nAfter an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight , Lincoln produced a `` \\tFarmers ' Almanac '' showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility . \\nArmstrong was \\tacquitted . \\nLeading up to his presidential campaign , Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case , with his defense of Simeon Quinn \\t`` Peachy '' Harrison who was a third cousin ; Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln 's political opponent , Rev . \\nPeter \\tCartwright . \\nHarrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who , as he lay \\tdying of his wounds , confessed to Cartwright that he had provoked Harrison . \\nLincoln angrily protested the judge 's initial decision to exclude \\tCartwright 's testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay . \\nLincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration \\tand was not subject to the hearsay rule . \\nInstead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected , the judge , a Democrat \\t, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence , resulting in Harrison 's acquittal . \\nRepublican politics ( \\t1854–1860 ) . \\nEmergence as \\tRepublican leader . \\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the \\tfree North , with the failure of the Compromise of 1850 , a legislative package designed to address the issue . \\nIn his 1852 eulogy for Clay , Lincoln highlighted the latter 's support for \\tgradual emancipation and opposition to `` both extremes '' on the slavery issue . \\nAs the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious , Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed popular \\tsovereignty as a compromise ; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery . \\nThe legislation alarmed many Northerners , who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that \\tcould result , but Douglas 's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854 . \\nLincoln did not comment on the act until months later \\tin his `` Peoria Speech '' of October 1854 . \\nLincoln then declared his opposition to slavery , \\twhich he repeated en route to the presidency . \\nHe said the Kansas Act had a `` '' declared '' indifference , but as \\tI must think , a covert `` real '' zeal for the spread of slavery . \\nI can not \\tbut hate it . \\nI hate it because of the \\tmonstrous injustice of slavery itself . \\nI hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world \\t... '' Lincoln 's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life . \\nNationally , the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska \\tAct and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue . \\nReflecting on the demise of his party , Lincoln wrote in 1855 , `` I think I am \\ta Whig , but others say there are no Whigs , and that I am an abolitionist ... \\nI do no more than oppose the \\t`` extension '' of slavery . '' \\nThe new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery , drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil \\t, Liberty , and antislavery Democratic Party members , Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties , fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists . \\nLincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs , though he lamented \\this party 's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement . \\nIn 1854 , Lincoln was elected to the \\tIllinois legislature but declined to take his seat . \\nThe year 's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act , \\tand in the aftermath , Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate . \\nAt that time , senators were \\telected by the state legislature . \\nAfter leading in the first six rounds of voting \\t, he was unable to obtain a majority . \\nLincoln instructed his backers to \\tvote for Lyman Trumbull . \\nTrumbull was an antislavery Democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots \\t; his supporters , also antislavery Democrats , had vowed not to support any Whig . \\nLincoln 's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull 's antislavery \\tDemocrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate , Joel Aldrich Matteson . \\n1856 \\tcampaign . \\nViolent political confrontations in Kansas continued , and opposition \\tto the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North . \\nAs the 1856 elections approached , Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended \\tthe Bloomington Convention , which formally established the Illinois Republican Party . \\nThe convention platform endorsed Congress 's right to regulate slavery in the \\tterritories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state . \\nLincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the \\tparty platform and called for the preservation of the Union . \\nAt the June 1856 Republican National Convention , though Lincoln received support to run as vice president \\t, John C. Frémont and William Dayton comprised the ticket , which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois . \\nThe Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan \\tand the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore . \\nBuchanan prevailed , while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor \\tof Illinois , and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois . \\n`` Dred Scott \\tv. Sandford '' . \\nDred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state \\tto a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise . \\nAfter Scott was returned to the slave state \\the petitioned a federal court for his freedom . \\nHis petition was denied in `` Dred \\tScott v. Sandford '' ( 1857 ) . \\nIn his opinion , Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights \\tfrom the Constitution , and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners ' `` property '' rights . \\nWhile many Democrats hoped that `` Dred Scott '' would end the dispute over \\tslavery in the territories , the decision sparked further outrage in the North . \\nLincoln denounced it as the product of a \\tconspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power . \\nHe argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence ; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every \\trespect , they believed all men were equal `` in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' . \\nLincoln–Douglas debates and \\tCooper Union speech . \\nIn 1858 , Douglas was up for re-election in the \\tU.S. Senate , and Lincoln hoped to defeat him . \\nMany in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858 , \\tand Lincoln 's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor . \\nSome eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the \\tLecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state . \\nMany Illinois Republicans resented \\tthis eastern interference . \\nFor the first time , Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon \\ta Senate candidate , and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition . \\nLincoln accepted the nomination with \\tgreat enthusiasm and zeal . \\nAfter his nomination he delivered his House Divided Speech , with the biblical \\treference Mark 3:25 , `` A house divided against itself can not stand . \\nI believe this government can not endure \\tpermanently half slave and half free . \\nI do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the \\thouse to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided . \\nIt will become all one thing \\t, or all the other . '' \\nThe speech created a stark image \\tof the danger of disunion . \\nThe stage was then set for the election of the Illinois \\tlegislature which would , in turn , select Lincoln or Douglas . \\nWhen informed of Lincoln 's nomination , Douglas stated , `` [ Lincoln ] is the strong man \\tof the party ... and if I beat him , my victory will be hardly won . '' \\nThe Senate campaign featured seven \\tdebates between Lincoln and Douglas . \\nThese were the most famous political debates in American history ; they had \\tan atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands . \\nThe principals stood in stark \\tcontrast both physically and politically . \\nLincoln warned that Douglas ' `` Slave Power '' was threatening the values of republicanism , \\tand accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers ' premise that all men are created equal . \\nDouglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose \\twhether to allow slavery and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists . \\nLincoln 's argument assumed a moral tone , as \\the claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery . \\nDouglas 's argument was more legal , claiming that Lincoln was defying the \\tauthority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the `` Dred Scott '' decision . \\nThough the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the \\tDemocrats won more seats , and the legislature re-elected Douglas . \\nLincoln 's articulation of the issues \\tgave him a national political presence . \\nIn May 1859 , Lincoln purchased the `` Illinois Staats-Anzeiger '' , a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive \\t; most of the state 's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratically but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support . \\nIn the aftermath of the 1858 election , newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate \\t, rivaled by William H. Seward , Salmon P. Chase , Edward Bates , and Simon Cameron . \\nWhile Lincoln was popular in the Midwest , he lacked support \\tin the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek office . \\nIn January 1860 , Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the \\tnomination if offered , and in the following months ' several local papers endorsed his candidacy . \\nOver the coming months , Lincoln was tireless , \\tmaking nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail . \\nBy the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric , \\the quickly became the champion of the Republican party . \\nHowever , despite his overwhelming support in the Midwestern United \\tStates , he was less appreciated in the east . \\nHorace Greeley , editor of the New York Tribune , at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln 's compromising position \\ton slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court 's Dred-Scott ruling , which was promptly used against him by his political rivals . \\nOn February 27 , 1860 , powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union , in which he \\targued that the Founding Fathers of the United States had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery . \\nHe insisted that morality required opposition to slavery , and rejected any `` \\tgroping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong '' . \\nMany in the audience thought he \\tappeared awkward and even ugly . \\nBut Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership \\tthat brought him into contention . \\nJournalist Noah Brooks reported , `` No man ever before made such \\tan impression on his first appeal to a New York audience . '' \\nHistorian David Herbert Donald described the speech as `` \\ta superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant . \\nAppearing in Seward 's home state , sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase , \\tLincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination '' . \\nIn response to an inquiry about his ambitions , Lincoln said , \\t`` The taste `` is '' in my mouth a little . '' \\n1860 presidential \\telection . \\nOn May 9–10 , 1860 , the Illinois \\tRepublican State Convention was held in Decatur . \\nLincoln 's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis , Norman Judd \\t, Leonard Swett , and Jesse DuBois , and Lincoln received his first endorsement . \\nExploiting his embellished frontier legend ( clearing land and splitting fence rails ) \\t, Lincoln 's supporters adopted the label of `` The Rail Candidate '' . \\nIn 1860 , Lincoln described himself : `` I am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , \\tweighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes . '' \\nMichael Martinez wrote about the effective \\timaging of Lincoln by his campaign . \\nAt times he was presented as the plain-talking `` Rail Splitter '' and \\tat other times he was `` Honest Abe '' , unpolished but trustworthy . \\nOn May 18 , at the Republican National Convention in Chicago , Lincoln won \\tthe nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as Seward and Chase . \\nA former Democrat , Hannibal Hamlin of Maine , \\twas nominated for vice president to balance the ticket . \\nLincoln 's success depended on his campaign team , his reputation as a moderate on \\tthe slavery issue , and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff . \\nPennsylvania put him over the top , led by the state \\t's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support . \\nLincoln 's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln 's \\tdictate to `` Make no contracts that will bind me '' . \\nAs the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government , \\tmost Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party . \\nThroughout the 1850s , Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war \\t, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession . \\nWhen Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats , delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic \\tconvention ; they opposed Douglas 's position on popular sovereignty , and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate . \\nA group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the \\tConstitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee . \\nLincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North , \\twhile Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South . \\nPrior to the Republican convention , the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization , the Wide Awakes , which it used to \\tgenerate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives , thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties . \\nPeople of the Northern states knew the Southern states \\twould vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln . \\nAs Douglas and the other candidates campaigned , Lincoln gave no \\tspeeches , relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party . \\nThe party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and \\tproduced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials . \\nRepublican speakers focused first on the party platform , and second \\ton Lincoln 's life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty . \\nThe goal was to demonstrate the power of `` free labor '' , which allowed \\ta common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts . \\nThe Republican Party 's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a `` Chicago \\tTribune '' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln 's life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies . \\nThough he did not give public appearances , \\tmany sought to visit him and write him . \\nIn the runup to the election , he took an office in \\tthe Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention . \\nHe also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary \\t, who would remain in that role during the presidency . \\nOn November 6 , 1860 , \\tLincoln was elected the 16th president . \\nHe was the first Republican president and his victory was \\tentirely due to his support in the North and West . \\nNo ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states , and he won \\tonly two of 996 counties in all the Southern states , an omen of the impending Civil War . \\nLincoln received 1,866,452 votes , or 39.8 % of the total in a four-way \\trace , carrying the free Northern states , as well as California and Oregon . \\nHis victory in the Electoral College was decisive : \\tLincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents . \\nPresidency ( \\t1861–1865 ) . \\nSecession and \\tinauguration . \\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln 's election , and in response secessionists \\timplemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 . \\nOn December 20 , 1860 , South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by \\tFebruary 1 , 1861 , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas followed . \\nSix of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation \\t, the Confederate States of America , and adopted a constitution . \\nThe upper South and border states ( Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina \\t, Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , and Arkansas ) initially rejected the secessionist appeal . \\nPresident Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to \\trecognize the Confederacy , declaring secession illegal . \\nThe Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its \\tprovisional president on February 9 , 1861 . \\nAttempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed Crittenden \\tCompromise as contrary to the Party 's platform of free-soil in the territories . \\nLincoln said , `` I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks \\tlike buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right . '' \\nLincoln tacitly supported the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution , which passed \\tCongress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office . \\nThat doomed amendment would have protected slavery \\tin states where it already existed . \\nA few weeks before the war , Lincoln sent a letter to every \\tgovernor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution . \\nOn February 11 , 1861 , Lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address \\tupon leaving Springfield ; he would never again return to Springfield alive . \\nLincoln traveled east in \\ta special train . \\nDue to secessionist plots , a then-unprecedented attention to \\tsecurity was given to him and his train . \\nEn route to his inauguration , Lincoln \\taddressed crowds and legislatures across the North . \\nThe president-elect evaded suspected \\tassassins in Baltimore . \\nOn February 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in \\tWashington , D.C. , which was placed under substantial military guard . \\nLincoln directed his inaugural address to the South , proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states : Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key \\tsource of conflict between North and South , stating `` One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended , while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended . \\nThis is the only \\tsubstantial dispute . '' \\nThe president ended his address with an appeal to the people of \\tthe South : `` We are not enemies , but friends . \\nWe must not \\tbe enemies ... \\nThe mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , \\twill yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . '' \\nThe failure of the Peace Conference of \\t1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible . \\nBy March 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection \\thad proposed rejoining the Union on any terms . \\nMeanwhile , Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that \\tthe dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated . \\nIn his second inaugural address , Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said : `` Both parties deprecated war , but one of them \\twould make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . '' \\nCivil \\tWar . \\nMajor Robert Anderson , commander of the Union 's Fort Sumter in Charleston , South Carolina , sent a request for provisions \\tto Washington , and Lincoln 's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war . \\nOn April 12 , 1861 , Confederate forces fired on \\tUnion troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight . \\nHistorian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis \\t, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South , and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion . \\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was `` sadly disappointed '' at his failure to \\trealize that `` the country was sleeping on a volcano '' and that the South was preparing for war . \\nDonald concludes that , `` His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing \\ton Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood . \\nBut he also vowed not \\tto surrender the forts . \\nThe only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates \\tto fire the first shot ; they did just that . '' \\nOn April 15 , Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts , protect \\tWashington , and `` preserve the Union '' , which , in his view , remained intact despite the seceding states . \\nThis call forced states \\tto choose sides . \\nVirginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of Richmond as \\tthe Confederate capital , despite its exposure to Union lines . \\nNorth Carolina , Tennessee , and Arkansas \\tfollowed over the following two months . \\nSecession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland , \\tbut did not prevail ; Kentucky remained neutral . \\nThe Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of \\tthe Mason-Dixon line to defend the nation . \\nAs States sent Union regiments south , on April 19 , Baltimore mobs \\tin control of the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains . \\nLocal leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the \\tcapital and the Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials . \\nLincoln suspended the writ of `` habeas corpus '' where \\tneeded for the security of troops trying to reach Washington . \\nJohn Merryman , one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements , petitioned Supreme Court \\tChief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of `` habeas corpus . '' \\nIn June , in Ex parte Merryman , Taney , not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court , issued the writ \\t, believing that Article I , section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it . \\nBut Lincoln persisted with the policy \\tof suspension in select areas . \\nUnion military \\tstrategy . \\nLincoln took executive control of the war \\tand shaped the Union military strategy . \\nHe responded to the unprecedented political and military \\tcrisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority . \\nHe expanded his war powers , imposed a blockade on Confederate ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by \\tCongress , suspended `` habeas corpus '' , and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers . \\nLincoln gained the support of Congress and \\tthe northern public for these actions . \\nLincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave \\tstates and keep the war from becoming an international conflict . \\nIt was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success , and that any compromise alienated \\tfactions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions . \\nCopperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing \\tto compromise on slavery . \\nThe Radical Republicans criticized him for \\tmoving too slowly in abolishing slavery . \\nOn August 6 , 1861 , Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judicial \\tproceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates . \\nThe law had little practical effect , but \\tit signaled political support for abolishing slavery . \\nIn August 1861 , General John C. Frémont , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee \\t, without consulting Washington , issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels . \\nLincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as \\tpolitically motivated and lacking military necessity . \\nAs a result , Union enlistments from Maryland , \\tKentucky , and Missouri increased by over 40,000 . \\nInternationally , Lincoln wanted to forestall \\tforeign military aid to the Confederacy . \\nHe relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while \\tworking closely with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner . \\nIn the 1861 Trent Affair which threatened war with Great Britain , the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship , \\tthe `` Trent '' , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered . \\nLincoln ended the crisis by \\treleasing the two diplomats . \\nBiographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln 's successful techniques : Lincoln \\tpainstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department . \\nHe tracked all phases of the effort , consulting with governors , and \\tselecting generals based on their success , their state , and their party . \\nIn January 1862 , after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the \\tWar Department , Lincoln replaced War Secretary Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton . \\nStanton centralized the War Department 's activities , auditing and \\tcanceling contracts , saving the federal government $ 17,000,000 . \\nStanton was a staunch Unionist , pro-business , conservative \\tDemocrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction . \\nHe worked more often and more closely \\twith Lincoln than any other senior official . \\n`` Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war \\ttogether '' , say Thomas and Hyman . \\nLincoln 's war strategy embraced two priorities : ensuring that Washington was well-defended \\tand conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt , decisive victory . \\nTwice a week , Lincoln met \\twith his cabinet in the afternoon . \\nOccasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage \\tride , concerned that he was working too hard . \\nFor his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General Henry Halleck entitled `` \\tElements of Military Art and Science '' ; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini . \\nLincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control \\tstrategic points , such as the Mississippi River . \\nLincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of \\tdefeating the enemy 's army , rather than merely capturing territory . \\nIn directing the Union 's war strategy , Lincoln valued the advice of Gen. Winfield \\tScott , even after his retirement as Commanding General of the United States Army . \\nOn June 23–24 , 1862 , President Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point , where he spent \\tfive hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department . \\nGeneral \\tMcClellan . \\nAfter the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott 's \\tretirement , Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief . \\nMcClellan then took months to \\tplan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign . \\nMcClellan 's slow progress frustrated Lincoln , as did his \\tposition that no troops were needed to defend Washington . \\nMcClellan , in turn , blamed the failure of the \\tcampaign on Lincoln 's reservation of troops for the capitol . \\nIn 1862 , Lincoln removed McClellan \\tfor the general 's continued inaction . \\nHe elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed John \\tPope as head of the new Army of Virginia . \\nPope satisfied Lincoln 's desire to advance on Richmond \\tfrom the north , thus protecting Washington from counterattack . \\nBut Pope was then soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the \\tsummer of 1862 , forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington . \\nDespite his dissatisfaction with McClellan 's failure to reinforce Pope , \\tLincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington . \\nTwo days after McClellan 's return to command , General Robert E. Lee 's \\tforces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland , leading to the Battle of Antietam . \\nThat battle , a Union victory , was among the bloodiest in \\tAmerican history ; it facilitated Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation in January . \\nMcClellan then resisted the president 's demand that he pursue Lee 's withdrawing army , while General Don \\tCarlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee . \\nLincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans ; and after the \\t1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside . \\nThe appointments were both politically neutral \\tand adroit on Lincoln 's part . \\nBurnside , against presidential advice , launched an offensive across the \\tRappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December . \\nDesertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased \\tafter Fredericksburg , so Lincoln replaced Burnside with Joseph Hooker . \\nIn the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation , high taxes , rumors of corruption , suspension \\tof `` habeas corpus '' , military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market . \\nThe Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest , but cost votes \\tin the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest , where many Southerners had lived for generations . \\nIn the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near ; the \\tplans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond , Rosecrans on Chattanooga , Grant on Vicksburg , and a naval assault on Charleston . \\nHooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in \\tMay , then resigned and was replaced by George Meade . \\nMeade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg \\tCampaign , but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln 's demands . \\nAt the same time , Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control \\tof the Mississippi River , splitting the far western rebel states . \\nEmancipation \\tProclamation . \\nThe Federal government 's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution , \\twhich before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states . \\nLincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented , because these territories \\twould be admitted to the Union as free states , and free states would come to outnumber slave states . \\nHe sought to persuade the states to \\tagree to compensation for emancipating their slaves . \\nLincoln rejected Major General John C. Frémont 's August 1861 emancipation attempt , as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May \\t1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede . \\nIn June 1862 , Congress passed an act banning \\tslavery on all federal territory , which Lincoln signed . \\nIn July , the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted , providing court procedures to free the slaves of \\tthose convicted of aiding the rebellion ; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional . \\nHe felt such action could be taken only within the war \\tpowers of the commander-in-chief , which he planned to exercise . \\nLincoln at this time reviewed a draft \\tof the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet . \\nPrivately , Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy \\t's slave base had to be eliminated . \\nCopperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification ; \\tRepublican editor Horace Greeley of the `` New York Tribune '' agreed . \\nIn a letter of August 22 , 1862 , Lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free , regardless of that , his first obligation as president was to preserve the \\tUnion : On September 22 , 1862 , Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation , which announced that , in states still in rebellion on January 1 , 1863 , the slaves would be freed . \\nHe kept his word and , on January 1 , 1863 , issued the Emancipation Proclamation , freeing the \\tslaves in 10 states not then under Union control , with exemptions specified for areas under such control . \\nLincoln 's comment on signing the Proclamation was : `` I never , in my life , \\tfelt more certain that I was doing right , than I do in signing this paper . '' \\nHe spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while \\tDemocrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites . \\nWith the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective \\t, Union armies advancing south liberated all three million slaves in the Confederacy . \\nThe Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be `` received into the armed \\tservice of the United States , '' enlisting these freedmen became official policy . \\nBy the spring of 1863 , Lincoln was ready \\tto recruit black troops in more than token numbers . \\nIn a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , Lincoln wrote , `` \\tThe bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once '' . \\nBy the end of 1863 , at Lincoln 's direction , General \\tLorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley . \\nGettysburg Address ( \\t1863 ) . \\nLincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg \\tbattlefield cemetery on November 19 , 1863 . \\nIn 272 words , and three minutes , Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789 , but \\tin 1776 , `` conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal '' . \\nHe defined the war as dedicated to the \\tprinciples of liberty and equality for all . \\nHe declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end , and the future of democracy \\twould be assured , that `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth '' . \\nDefying his prediction that `` the world will little note , nor long remember what \\twe say here '' , the Address became the most quoted speech in American history . \\nPromoting General \\tGrant . \\nGeneral Ulysses Grant 's victories at the Battle of \\tShiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln . \\nResponding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh , Lincoln had \\tsaid , `` I ca n't spare this man . \\nHe fights \\t. '' \\nWith Grant in command , Lincoln felt the Union Army could \\tadvance in multiple theaters , while also including black troops . \\nMeade 's failure to capture Lee 's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity \\tof the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander . \\nGrant then assumed command \\tof Meade 's army . \\nLincoln was concerned that Grant might be \\tconsidering a presidential candidacy in 1864 . \\nHe arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant 's political intentions , and once assured that he had none , \\tLincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General , a rank which had been unoccupied since George Washington . \\nAuthorization for such a promotion `` with the advice and consent of the Senate '' was provided by \\ta new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant 's name to the Senate . \\nHis nomination was confirmed by the \\tSenate on March 2 , 1864 . \\nGrant in 1864 waged the bloody Overland Campaign \\t, which exacted heavy losses on both sides . \\nWhen Lincoln asked what Grant 's plans were , the persistent general replied , `` \\tI propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . '' \\nGrant 's army \\tmoved steadily south . \\nLincoln traveled to Grant 's headquarters at City Point , \\tVirginia , to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman . \\nLincoln reacted to Union losses by \\tmobilizing support throughout the North . \\nLincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations , railroads , and \\tbridges—hoping to weaken the South 's morale and fighting ability . \\nHe emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction \\t( which was considerable ) for its own sake . \\nLincoln 's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington , D.C. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position \\t, Union Captain ( and future Supreme Court Justice ) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. shouted at him , `` Get down , you damn fool , before you get shot ! '' \\nAs Grant continued to weaken Lee 's \\tforces , efforts to discuss peace began . \\nConfederate Vice President Stephens led a group meeting with \\tLincoln , Seward , and others at Hampton Roads . \\nLincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal \\t; his objective to end the fighting was not realized . \\nOn April 1 , 1865 , Grant \\tnearly encircled Petersburg in a siege . \\nThe Confederate government evacuated Richmond and \\tLincoln visited the conquered capital . \\nOn April 9 , Lee surrendered to Grant \\tat Appomattox , officially ending the war . \\nReelection \\t. \\nLincoln ran for reelection in 1864 , while uniting the main Republican \\tfactions , along with War Democrats Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson . \\nLincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build \\tsupport and fend off the Radicals ' efforts to replace him . \\nAt its convention , the Republicans \\tselected Johnson as his running mate . \\nTo broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans \\t, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party . \\nGrant 's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln 's re-election \\tprospects , and many Republicans feared defeat . \\nLincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over \\tthe White House ; Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet , but asked them to sign the sealed envelope . \\nThe pledge read as follows : The Democratic platform followed the `` Peace wing '' of the party and called \\tthe war a `` failure '' ; but their candidate , McClellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform . \\nMeanwhile , Lincoln emboldened Grant with \\tmore troops and Republican party support . \\nSherman 's capture of Atlanta in September and \\tDavid Farragut 's capture of Mobile ended defeatism . \\nThe Democratic Party was deeply split , with \\tsome leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln . \\nThe National Union Party was united \\tby Lincoln 's support for emancipation . \\nState Republican parties stressed the \\tperfidy of the Copperheads . \\nOn November 8 , Lincoln carried all but three \\tstates , including 78 percent of Union soldiers . \\nOn March 4 , 1865 , \\tLincoln delivered his second inaugural address . \\nIn it , he deemed the war \\tcasualties to be God 's will . \\nHistorian Mark Noll places the speech `` among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which \\tAmericans conceive their place in the world ; '' it is inscribed in the Lincoln Memorial . \\nLincoln said \\t: Reconstruction . \\nReconstruction preceded the war 's end , as Lincoln and his associates considered the \\treintegration of the nation , and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves . \\nWhen a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be \\ttreated , Lincoln replied , `` Let 'em up easy . '' \\nLincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath \\t, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states . \\nHis main goal was to keep the union together , so he proceeded by focusing \\tnot on whom to blame , but on how to rebuild the nation as one . \\nLincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals , under Rep. Thaddeus \\tStevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade , who otherwise remained Lincoln 's allies . \\nDetermined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South , \\tLincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held . \\nHis Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate \\tcivil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners , if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance . \\nAs Southern states fell , they needed \\tleaders while their administrations were restored . \\nIn Tennessee and Arkansas , Lincoln respectively appointed \\tJohnson and Frederick Steele as military governors . \\nIn Louisiana , Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood \\twhen 10 percent of the voters agreed , and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery . \\nDemocratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to \\tensure his and the Republicans ' political aspirations . \\nThe Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their \\town plan , the 1864 Wade–Davis Bill , which Lincoln vetoed . \\nThe Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected \\trepresentatives from Louisiana , Arkansas , and Tennessee . \\nLincoln 's appointments were designed to \\tharness both moderates and Radicals . \\nTo fill Chief Justice Taney 's seat on the Supreme Court , he named the Radicals ' \\tchoice , Salmon P. Chase , who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies . \\nAfter implementing the Emancipation Proclamation , Lincoln increased pressure on Congress \\tto outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment . \\nHe declared that such an amendment would `` clinch the whole matter \\t'' and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress . \\nThis first attempt fell short of the required \\ttwo-thirds majority in the House of Representatives . \\nPassage became part of Lincoln 's reelection platform , and after his successful reelection \\t, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31 , 1865 . \\nWith ratification , it became the Thirteenth Amendment to \\tthe United States Constitution on December 6 , 1865 . \\nLincoln believed the federal government had limited \\tresponsibility to the millions of freedmen . \\nHe signed Senator Charles Sumner 's Freedmen 's Bureau bill that set up \\ta temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves . \\nThe law opened land for a lease of three years \\twith the ability to purchase title for the freedmen . \\nLincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control \\t, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists . \\nHistorians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly \\thow Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived . \\nBiographers James G. Randall and Richard Current , according to David Lincove \\t, argue that : Eric Foner argues that : Native Americans . \\nLincoln 's experience with Native Americans started early with their \\tkilling of his grandfather in front of the family . \\nLater he served as a Captain in the state \\tmilitia during the Black Hawk War seeing no combat . \\nDuring his presidency , his policy \\ttoward Indians was based on politics . \\nHe used appointments to the Indian Bureau as \\ta reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin . \\nWhile in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers \\t, railroads , and telegraphs , from Indian attacks . \\nOn August 17 , 1862 , the Sioux \\tor Dakota uprising broke out in Minnesota . \\nHundreds of settlers were killed , 30,000 were displaced \\tfrom their homes , and Washington was deeply alarmed . \\nSome feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate \\tconspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier . \\nLincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war \\tsent by railroad to put down the uprising . \\nWhen the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians , \\tLincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in Minnesota . \\nLincoln sent General John Pope to Minnesota as commander of the new \\tDepartment of the Northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities . \\nBefore he arrived the Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa sent Lincoln a letter begging to go to war \\tfor the United States against the Sioux , so Lincoln could send Minnesota 's troops to fight the south . \\nShortly after , a Mille Lacs Band \\tChief offered the same at St . \\nCloud , \\tMinnesota . \\nIn it the Chippewa specified that they wanted \\tto use the indigenous rules of warfare . \\nThat meant there would be no prisoners of \\twar , no surrender , no peace agreement . \\nLincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer , as he had no means to control \\tthe outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare . \\nOnce word reached the other bands of Chippewa , he had no way of knowing \\thow they would react to his sending the Fond Du Lac on the warpath . \\nOne of the Chippewa signing the letter , Chief Naw-Gaw-Nub , \\thad received a Presidential medal from Lincoln earlier in the year . \\nServing under Gen. Pope was \\tMinnesota Congressman Henry H. Sibley . \\nMinnesota 's Governor had made Sibley a Colonel United States Volunteers to command the US force tasked with \\tfighting the war and that eventually defeated Little Crow 's forces at the Battle of Wood Lake . \\nThe day the Mdewakanton force surrendered at Camp Release , a Chippewa war council met \\tat Minnesota 's capitol with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln , to fight the Sioux . \\nSibley ordered a military commission to review that actions of \\tthe captured to try those that had committed war crimes . \\nThe legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants \\thad been established during the Mexican War . \\nSibley thought he had 16-20 of men he wanted for trial \\twhile Gen. Pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried . \\nWhen it was done , 303 had been given \\tdeath sentences that were subject to Presidential review . \\nLincoln ordered Gen Pope send all of the trial transcripts Washington \\twhere he and two of his staff poured over the trials . \\nThe lawyer in \\tLincoln saw issues . \\nHe slowly realized that the trials could be divided into \\ttwo groups : combat between combatants and combat against civilians . \\nThe groups could be identified by their transcripts , the first group were all just three \\tpages in length while the second group had more pages , some up to twelve . \\nHe placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted \\ttheir sentences for the largest mass commutation in history . \\nInto the second \\tgroup went forty . \\nOne he commuted for \\tturning state 's witness . \\nAnother Sibley dismissed when overwhelming \\tproof surfaced exonerating the man . \\nThe remaining 38 were executed in the \\tlargest mass hanging in US history . \\nVery quickly questions arose concerning three of \\tthe executions that have not been answered . \\nLess than four months after the executions Lincoln issued General Order 100 \\tthat relates more to the Minnesota War than the Civil War . \\nNow a Congressman , Alexander Ramsey told Lincoln , in 1864 , that he would \\thave gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton . \\nLincoln responded , `` I could not \\tafford to hang men for votes . '' \\nThe men whose sentences he commuted were sent \\tto a military prison at Davenport , Iowa . \\nA few of those he had released due \\tto the efforts of Bishop Henry Whipple . \\nWhig theory of \\ta presidency . \\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on \\texecuting laws while deferring to Congress ' responsibility for legislating . \\nLincoln vetoed only four bills , including the \\tWade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program . \\nThe 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of \\tWestern government-held land available for purchase at low cost . \\nThe 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government \\tgrants for agricultural colleges in each state . \\nThe Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction \\tof the United States ' first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 1869 . \\nThe passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the \\tabsence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s . \\nIn the selection and use of his cabinet , Lincoln employed the \\tstrengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency . \\nLincoln commented on his thought process , `` We need \\tthe strongest men of the party in the Cabinet . \\nWe needed to hold \\tour own people together . \\nI had looked the party over and concluded \\tthat these were the very strongest men . \\nThen I had no right to deprive \\tthe country of their services . '' \\nGoodwin described the group in her biography \\tas a `` Team of Rivals '' . \\nThere were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government : tariffs \\t( a policy with long precedent ) , and a Federal income tax . \\nIn 1861 , Lincoln signed the second and third \\tMorrill Tariffs , following the first enacted by Buchanan . \\nHe also signed the Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income \\ttax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $ 800 ( ) . \\nThe Revenue Act of 1862 adopted \\trates that increased with income . \\nThe Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the \\tfederal government 's economic influence in other areas . \\nThe National Banking Act created \\tthe system of national banks . \\nThe US issued paper currency for the first time , \\tknown as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side . \\nIn 1862 , Congress created \\tthe Department of Agriculture . \\nIn response to rumors of a renewed draft , the editors of the `` New York World '' and the `` Journal \\tof Commerce '' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market . \\nLincoln attacked the media for such behavior , and ordered a \\tmilitary seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days . \\nLincoln is largely responsible \\tfor the Thanksgiving holiday . \\nThanksgiving had become a regional holiday in \\tNew England in the 17th century . \\nIt had been sporadically proclaimed by \\tthe federal government on irregular dates . \\nThe prior proclamation had been during James \\tMadison 's presidency 50 years earlier . \\nIn 1863 , Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November \\tof that year to be a day of Thanksgiving . \\nIn June 1864 , Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress , which \\tprovided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park . \\nSupreme Court \\tappointments . \\nLincoln 's philosophy on court nominations was that `` we can not ask a man what he will do \\t, and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it . \\nTherefore we must take a man \\twhose opinions are known . '' \\nLincoln made five appointments \\tto the Supreme Court . \\nNoah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer \\twho was committed to the Union . \\nSamuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the \\t1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist . \\nDavid Davis was Lincoln 's campaign manager in 1860 and had served \\tas a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced . \\nDemocrat Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme \\tCourt justice , provided geographic and political balance . \\nFinally , Lincoln 's Treasury Secretary , \\tSalmon P. Chase , became Chief Justice . \\nLincoln believed Chase was an able jurist , would support Reconstruction \\tlegislation , and that his appointment united the Republican Party . \\nForeign \\tpolicy . \\nLincoln named his main political rival William H. Seward as Secretary \\tof State , and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio . \\nHowever Lincoln did select some of the top \\tdiplomats as part of his patronage policy . \\nHe also closely watched the handling of the `` Trent '' Affair in late \\t1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with Britain . \\nSeward 's main role was to keep \\tBritain and France from supporting the Confederacy . \\nHe was successful after indicating to London and Paris that \\tWashington would declare war on them if they supported Richmond . \\nAssassination \\t. \\nJohn Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland ; though \\the never joined the Confederate army , he had contacts with the Confederate secret service . \\nAfter attending an April 11 , 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting \\trights for blacks , Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President . \\nWhen Booth learned of the Lincolns ' intent to attend a play with General \\tGrant , he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford 's Theatre . \\nLincoln and his wife attended the play `` Our American Cousin '' on the evening of \\tApril 14 , just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse . \\nAt the last minute , Grant decided to go to New \\tJersey to visit his children instead of attending the play . \\nOn April 14 , 1865 , hours before he was assassinated , Lincoln signed legislation establishing the United States Secret Service , and , at 10:15 in the evening \\t, Booth entered the back of Lincoln 's theater box , crept up from behind , and fired at the back of Lincoln 's head , mortally wounding him . \\nLincoln 's guest , Major Henry Rathbone , momentarily grappled \\twith Booth , but Booth stabbed him and escaped . \\nAfter being attended by Doctor Charles Leale and two other doctors \\t, Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House . \\nAfter remaining in a coma for eight hours , Lincoln \\tdied at 7:22 in the morning on April 15 . \\nStanton saluted and said , `` Now \\the belongs to the ages . '' \\nLincoln 's body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin , which was loaded \\tinto a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers . \\nPresident Johnson was sworn in \\tlater that same day . \\nTwo weeks later , Booth , refusing to surrender , was tracked to a farm in \\tVirginia , and was mortally shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett and died on April 26 . \\nSecretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken \\talive , so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed . \\nAfter a brief interview , Stanton declared \\thim a patriot and dismissed the charge . \\nFuneral and \\tburial . \\nThe late President lay in state , first in the East Room of the White \\tHouse , and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21 . \\nThe caskets containing Lincoln 's body and the body of his son Willie \\ttraveled for three weeks on the `` Lincoln Special '' funeral train . \\nThe train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield , Illinois \\t, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands . \\nMany others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with \\tbands , bonfires , and hymn singing or in silent grief . \\nPoet Walt Whitman composed `` When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd \\t'' to eulogize him , one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln . \\nAfrican Americans were especially moved ; they \\thad lost their `` Moses '' . \\nIn a larger sense , the reaction was in response \\tto the deaths of so many men in the war . \\nHistorians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but \\tnoted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death . \\nLincoln 's body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery \\tin Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb . \\nReligious and \\tphilosophical beliefs . \\nAs a young man , \\tLincoln was a religious skeptic . \\nHe was deeply familiar with the \\tBible , quoting and praising it . \\nHe was private about his position on organized \\treligion and respected the beliefs of others . \\nHe never made a clear \\tprofession of Christian beliefs . \\nThroughout his public career , \\tLincoln often quoted Scripture . \\nHis three most famous speeches—the House Divided Speech , the Gettysburg Address , \\tand his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to Providence and quotes from Scripture . \\nIn the 1840s , Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity , \\ta belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power . \\nWith the death of his son Edward in 1850 \\the more frequently expressed a dependence on God . \\nHe never joined a church , although he frequently attended \\tFirst Presbyterian Church with his wife beginning in 1852 . \\nIn the 1850s , Lincoln asserted his belief in `` providence '' in a general way , and rarely used the \\tlanguage or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence . \\nThe death of his son Willie in February 1862 may \\thave caused him to look toward religion for solace . \\nAfter Willie 's death , he questioned the \\tdivine necessity of the war 's severity . \\nHe wrote at this time that God `` could have \\teither saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest . \\nYet the \\tcontest began . \\nAnd having begun , He could give the \\tfinal victory to either side any day . \\nYet the contest \\tproceeds . '' \\nLincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events \\tand by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches . \\nBy the end of the war , he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events , writing on April 4 , 1864 , to a newspaper editor in Kentucky : This spirituality can best be \\tseen in his second inaugural address , considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in American history , and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech , or one of them at the very least . \\nLincoln explains therein that the cause , purpose , \\tand result of the war was God 's will . \\nLincoln 's frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his \\town personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences , who were mostly evangelical Protestants . \\nOn the day Lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told \\this wife he desired to visit the Holy Land . \\nHealth \\t. \\nLincoln is believed to have had \\tdepression , smallpox , and malaria . \\nHe took blue mass pills , which \\tcontained mercury , to treat constipation . \\nIt is unknown to what extent that \\tmight have resulted in mercury poisoning . \\nSeveral claims have been made that Lincoln \\t's health was declining before the assassination . \\nThese are often based on photographs of Lincoln \\tappearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting . \\nIt is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic \\tdisease such as Marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B . \\nLegacy \\t. \\nRepublican \\tvalues . \\nLincoln 's redefinition of `` republican values '' has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick \\tDiggins , Harry V. Jaffa , Vernon Burton , Eric Foner , and Herman J. Belz . \\nLincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for \\tall—the `` sheet anchor '' of republicanism beginning in the 1850s . \\nHe did this at a time when the Constitution , which `` \\ttolerated slavery '' , was the focus of most political discourse . \\nDiggins notes , `` Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution \\tto the theory and destiny of republicanism itself '' in the 1860 Cooper Union speech . \\nInstead of focusing on the legality of an argument \\t, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism . \\nHis position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a \\tcontract among the states , and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract . \\nFurthermore , it was a national duty to \\tensure the republic stands in every state . \\nMany soldiers and religious leaders from the north , though , felt the fight \\tfor liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs . \\nAs a Whig activist , Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high \\ttariffs , banks , infrastructure improvements , and railroads , in opposition to Jacksonian democrats . \\nLincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man , but he \\tdisagreed with the Jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise . \\nNevertheless , Lincoln admired Andrew Jackson 's \\tsteeliness as well as his patriotism . \\nAccording to historian Sean Wilentz : William C. Harris found that Lincoln 's `` reverence for the Founding Fathers , the \\tConstitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism . '' \\nJames G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation `` in his preference for orderly progress , \\this distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform . '' \\nRandall concludes that `` he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism ' which involved abuse of the South , \\thatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders . '' \\nReunification of \\tthe states . \\nIn Lincoln 's first inaugural address , \\the explored the nature of democracy . \\nHe denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that \\tmajority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints . \\nHe said `` A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with \\tdeliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . '' \\nThe successful reunification of the states had \\tconsequences for how people viewed the country . \\nThe term `` the United States '' has historically been used sometimes in the \\tplural ( `` these United States '' ) and other times in the singular . \\nThe Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance \\tof the singular usage by the end of the 19th century . \\nHistorical \\treputation . \\nIn surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 , the top three presidents \\tare Lincoln , Washington , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt , although the order varies . \\nBetween 1999 and 2011 , Lincoln , John F. Kennedy , and Ronald Reagan \\thave been the top-ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys , according to Gallup . \\nA 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked \\tLincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington . \\nLincoln 's assassination left \\thim a national martyr . \\nHe was viewed by abolitionists as \\ta champion of human liberty . \\nRepublicans linked Lincoln 's \\tname to their party . \\nMany , though not all , in the South \\tconsidered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability . \\nHistorians have said he was `` a \\tclassical liberal '' in the 19th-century sense . \\nAllen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a `` classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy , a friend to trade and business as ennobling \\tand enabling , and an American counterpart to Mill , Cobden , and Bright '' , whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office . \\nSociologist Barry Schwartz argues that Lincoln 's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era \\t( 1900–1920s ) , when he emerged as one of America 's most venerated heroes , even among white Southerners . \\nThe high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. Union nationalism , \\tas envisioned by Lincoln , `` helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt . '' \\nIn the New Deal era , liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war \\tpresident , but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state . \\nSchwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred \\tand provided the nation with `` a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life . '' \\nDuring the Great Depression , he argues , Lincoln served `` as a means for seeing \\tthe world 's disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful . '' \\nFranklin D. Roosevelt , preparing America for war , used the words of \\tthe Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan . \\nAmericans asked , `` What \\twould Lincoln do ? '' \\nHowever , Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln 's symbolic power has lost \\trelevance , and this `` fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness . '' \\nHe suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism \\thave diluted greatness as a concept . \\nIn the Cold War years , Lincoln 's image shifted to a \\tsymbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes . \\nHe had long been known as the Great Emancipator , but , by the late 1960s , \\tsome African American intellectuals , led by Lerone Bennett Jr. , denied that Lincoln deserved that title . \\nBennett won wide attention when he called \\tLincoln a white supremacist in 1968 . \\nHe noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs \\tand told jokes that ridiculed blacks . \\nBennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed \\tthat freed slaves voluntarily move to another country . \\nThe emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves \\tfrom slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them . \\nDefenders of Lincoln , such as authors Dirck and Cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his \\tday and that he was a `` moral visionary '' who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible . \\nDirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett seriously , \\tpointing to his `` narrow political agenda and faulty research '' . \\nBy the 1970s , Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neo-Confederates such as Mel Bradford , who denounced his treatment of the white South—for his intense nationalism , his support for business \\t, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery , his acting on Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers . \\nLincoln became a favorite of \\tliberal intellectuals across the world . \\nBarry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln 's image suffered `` erosion \\t, fading prestige , benign ridicule '' in the late 20th century . \\nOn the other hand , Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet \\tJohn Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were `` content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason '' . \\nIn the 21st century , President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite \\tpresident and insisted on using the Lincoln Bible for his inaugural ceremonies . \\nLincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood \\t, almost always in a flattering light . \\nMemory and \\tmemorials . \\nLincoln 's portrait appears on two denominations of United States \\tcurrency , the penny and the $ 5 bill . \\nHis likeness also appears \\ton many postage stamps . \\nWhile he is usually portrayed bearded , he did not grow \\ta beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell . \\nHe was the first of \\tfive presidents to do so . \\nHe has been memorialized in many town , city , \\tand county names , including the capital of Nebraska . \\nThe United States Navy is named after Lincoln , \\tthe second Navy ship to bear his name . \\nThe Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nation 's capital \\tand is one of the top five visited National Park Service sites in the country . \\nFord 's Theatre , among the top sites in Washington , D.C. \\t, is across the street from Petersen House , where Lincoln died . \\nMemorials in Springfield , Illinois , include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential \\tLibrary and Museum , Lincoln 's home , and his tomb . \\nA portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents \\ton Mount Rushmore , which receives about 3 million visitors a year . \\nAn stands in Lincoln Park Chicago , with recastings given as diplomatic gifts \\tstanding in Parliament Square , London , and Parque Lincoln , Mexico City . \\nIn 2019 , Congress officially dedicated room H-226 \\tin the US Capitol to Abraham Lincoln . \\nThe room is located off of National Statuary Hall and previously served as the \\tpost office of the House while then-Representative Abraham Lincoln served in Congress from 1847-1849 . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 308 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=308 '' title= '' Aristotle '' > Aristotle Aristotle \\t( ; `` Aristotélēs '' , ; 384–322 BC ) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece . \\nTaught by Plato , he was the founder of the Peripatetic \\tschool of philosophy within the Lyceum and the wider Aristotelian tradition . \\nHis writings cover many subjects including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry \\t, theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics , meteorology , geology , and government . \\nAristotle provided a complex synthesis of the \\tvarious philosophies existing prior to him . \\nIt was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its \\tintellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry . \\nAs a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of \\tknowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion . \\nLittle is known \\tabout his life . \\nAristotle was born in the city \\tof Stagira in Northern Greece . \\nHis father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a \\tchild , and he was brought up by a guardian . \\nAt seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato 's Academy \\tin Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ( ) . \\nShortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip \\tII of Macedon , tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC . \\nHe established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to \\tproduce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls . \\nThough Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication , only around a \\tthird of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication . \\nAristotle 's views profoundly \\tshaped medieval scholarship . \\nThe influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance \\t, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed . \\nSome of Aristotle 's zoological observations found in his biology , such as on the \\thectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were disbelieved until the 19th century . \\nHe also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages , as well as Christian theology , \\tespecially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church . \\nAristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as `` The First Teacher '' , and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas \\tas simply `` The Philosopher '' , while the poet Dante called him `` the master of those who know '' . \\nHis works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , and \\twere studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan . \\nAristotle 's influence on logic continued \\twell into the 19th century . \\nIn addition , his ethics , though always influential , \\tgained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . \\nAristotle has been called the father of logic , biology , political science , zoology , embryology , natural \\tlaw , scientific method , rhetoric , psychology , realism , criticism , individualism , teleology , and meteorology . \\nLife \\t. \\nIn general , the details of \\tAristotle 's life are not well-established . \\nThe biographies written in ancient times are often speculative \\tand historians only agree on a few salient points . \\nAristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira , Chalcidice , \\tabout 55 km ( 34 miles ) east of modern-day Thessaloniki . \\nHis father , Nicomachus , was the \\tpersonal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon . \\nWhile he was young , Aristotle learned about biology and \\tmedical information , which was taught by his father . \\nBoth of Aristotle 's parents died when he was about \\tthirteen , and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . \\nAlthough little information about Aristotle 's childhood has survived , he probably spent some \\ttime within the Macedonian palace , making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy . \\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen , Aristotle moved \\tto Athens to continue his education at Plato 's Academy . \\nHe probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at \\tthe Eleusinian Mysteries , `` to experience is to learn '' [ παθείν μαθεĩν ] . \\nAristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty \\tyears before leaving in 348/47 BC . \\nThe traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy 's direction after control passed to Plato 's nephew \\tSpeusippus , although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died . \\nAristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of \\this friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor . \\nAfter the death of Hermias , Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos \\t, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon . \\nWhile in Lesbos , Aristotle married Pythias , \\teither Hermias 's adoptive daughter or niece . \\nShe bore him a daughter , \\twhom they also named Pythias . \\nIn 343 BC , Aristotle was invited by Philip II \\tof Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander . \\nAristotle was appointed as the head \\tof the royal academy of Macedon . \\nDuring Aristotle 's time in the Macedonian court , he gave lessons not only \\tto Alexander but also to two other future kings : Ptolemy and Cassander . \\nAristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest , and Aristotle \\t's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric . \\nIn one famous example , he counsels Alexander to be `` a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians , \\tto look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants '' . \\nBy 335 BC , Aristotle had returned to Athens , \\testablishing his own school there known as the Lyceum . \\nAristotle conducted courses at the school \\tfor the next twelve years . \\nWhile in Athens , his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of \\tStagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , Nicomachus . \\nIf the `` Suda '' an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages is accurate \\t, he may also have had an `` erômenos '' , Palaephatus of Abydus . \\nThis period in Athens , between 335 and 323 BC , is \\twhen Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works . \\nHe wrote many dialogues , of \\twhich only fragments have survived . \\nThose works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part \\t, intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students . \\nHis most important treatises include `` Physics '' , `` Metaphysics '' , `` Nicomachean Ethics \\t'' , `` Politics '' , `` On the Soul '' and `` Poetics '' . \\nAristotle studied and made significant contributions to `` logic , metaphysics , mathematics , physics , biology \\t, botany , ethics , politics , agriculture , medicine , dance , and theatre . '' \\nNear the end of his life , Alexander and Aristotle \\tbecame estranged over Alexander 's relationship with Persia and Persians . \\nA widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander 's death , but \\tthe only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death . \\nFollowing Alexander 's death , anti-Macedonian \\tsentiment in Athens was rekindled . \\nIn 322 BC , Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety , prompting him to flee to his mother 's family estate in Chalcis , on Euboea , at which \\toccasion he was said to have stated : `` I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy '' – a reference to Athens 's trial and execution of Socrates . \\nHe died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student Antipater as \\this chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife . \\nSpeculative \\tphilosophy . \\nLogic \\t. \\nWith the `` Prior Analytics '' , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , \\tand his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic . \\nKant stated in the `` Critique of Pure Reason \\t'' that with Aristotle logic reached its completion . \\n`` Organon \\t'' . \\nWhat is today called `` Aristotelian logic '' with its types of syllogism ( \\tmethods of logical argument ) , Aristotle himself would have labelled `` analytics '' . \\nThe term `` logic '' he \\treserved to mean `` dialectics '' . \\nMost of Aristotle 's work is probably not in its original form \\t, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers . \\nThe logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the \\t`` Organon '' around 40 BC by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers . \\nThe books are : The order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are \\tcomposed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle 's writings . \\nIt goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the `` Categories , '' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in `` On Interpretation '' , to \\tthe study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the `` Analytics '' ) and dialectics ( in the `` Topics '' and `` Sophistical Refutations '' ) . \\nThe first three treatises form the core of the logical theory `` stricto sensu '' \\t: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning . \\nThe `` Rhetoric '' is not conventionally included , but \\tit states that it relies on the `` Topics '' . \\nMetaphysics \\t. \\nThe word `` metaphysics '' appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled \\tvarious small selections of Aristotle 's works to the treatise we know by the name `` Metaphysics '' . \\nAristotle called it `` first philosophy '' , and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science ( physics ) \\tas the contemplative ( `` theoretikē '' ) philosophy which is `` theological '' and studies the divine . \\nHe wrote in his `` Metaphysics \\t'' ( 1026a16 ) : Substance . \\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance ( `` ousia '' ) and essence ( `` to ti ên einai '' , `` the what it was to be '' ) in \\this `` Metaphysics '' ( Book VII ) , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hylomorphism . \\nIn Book VIII , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as \\tthe substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed . \\nFor example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers , etc. , or whatever constitutes the `` potential '' house , while the form \\tof the substance is the `` actual '' house , namely 'covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house . \\nThe formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , \\tand the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form . \\nImmanent \\trealism . \\nLike his teacher Plato , Aristotle \\t's philosophy aims at the universal . \\nAristotle 's ontology places the universal ( `` katholou '' ) in particulars ( `` kath ' hekaston '' ) \\t, things in the world , whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate . \\nFor Aristotle , `` form '' is still what phenomena are based \\ton , but is `` instantiated '' in a particular substance . \\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form , which \\tcould be either a property or a relation to other things . \\nWhen one looks at an apple , for example , one sees an \\tapple , and one can also analyse a form of an apple . \\nIn this distinction , there is a particular \\tapple and a universal form of an apple . \\nMoreover , one can place an apple next to a book , so that one \\tcan speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other . \\nPlato argued that there are some universal forms \\tthat are not a part of particular things . \\nFor example , it is possible that there is no particular good in \\texistence , but `` good '' is still a proper universal form . \\nAristotle disagreed with Plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated at some \\tperiod of time , and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things . \\nIn addition , Aristotle disagreed with \\tPlato about the location of universals . \\nWhere Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them \\t, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated . \\nSo , according to Aristotle , the form of apple exists within \\teach apple , rather than in the world of the forms . \\nPotentiality and \\tactuality . \\nConcerning the nature of change ( `` kinesis '' ) and its causes , as he outlines in his `` Physics '' and `` On Generation and Corruption ( `` 319b–320a ) , he \\tdistinguishes coming-to-be ( `` genesis '' , also translated as 'generation ' ) from : Coming-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed . \\nIn that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( `` dynamis '' ) \\tand actuality ( `` entelecheia '' ) in association with the matter and the form . \\nReferring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing or being \\tacted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else . \\nFor example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( `` dynamei '' ) \\ta plant , and if it is not prevented by something , it will become a plant . \\nPotentially beings can either 'act ' ( `` poiein '' ) or 'be acted upon \\t' ( `` paschein '' ) , which can be either innate or learned . \\nFor example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ) , \\twhile the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting ) . \\nActuality is the fulfilment of \\tthe end of the potentiality . \\nBecause the end ( `` telos '' ) is the principle of every change , and \\tpotentiality exists for the sake of the end , actuality , accordingly , is the end . \\nReferring then to the previous example , it can be said that an \\tactuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do . \\nIn summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity \\tof building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end . \\nThen Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior \\tto potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality . \\nWith this definition of the particular substance ( i.e. , matter and form ) , Aristotle tries to solve the problem \\tof the unity of the beings , for example , `` what is it that makes a man one '' ? \\nSince , according to Plato there are two Ideas : \\tanimal and biped , how then is man a unity ? \\nHowever , according to Aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) \\tand the actual one ( form ) are one and the same . \\nEpistemology \\t. \\nAristotle 's immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of \\tthe universal , whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these . \\nAristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction , whereas Plato \\trelies on deduction from `` a priori '' principles . \\nNatural \\tphilosophy . \\nAristotle 's `` natural philosophy '' spans a wide range of natural phenomena \\tincluding those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences . \\nIn Aristotle 's terminology , `` natural philosophy '' is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the \\tnatural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences . \\nAristotle 's work encompassed virtually \\tall facets of intellectual inquiry . \\nAristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning \\t, which he also would describe as `` science '' . \\nHowever , his use of the term `` science '' carries a \\tdifferent meaning than that covered by the term `` scientific method '' . \\nFor Aristotle , `` all science ( `` dianoia '' ) is either \\tpractical , poetical or theoretical '' ( `` Metaphysics '' 1025b25 ) . \\nHis practical science includes ethics and politics ; his poetical science means the study of \\tfine arts including poetry ; his theoretical science covers physics , mathematics and metaphysics . \\nPhysics \\t. \\nFive \\telements . \\nIn his `` On Generation and Corruption '' , Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles , earth , \\twater , air , and fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry . \\nIn the Empedoclean scheme , all matter was made \\tof the four elements , in differing proportions . \\nAristotle 's scheme added the heavenly aether , the divine \\tsubstance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets . \\nMotion \\t. \\nAristotle describes two kinds of motion : `` violent '' or `` unnatural motion '' , such as that of a thrown stone , in the `` Physics \\t'' ( 254b10 ) , and `` natural motion '' , such as of a falling object , in `` On the Heavens '' ( 300a20 ) . \\nIn violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also : in other \\twords , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , since Aristotle does not address friction . \\nWith this understanding , it can be observed that , as Aristotle stated , heavy objects ( on the ground \\t, say ) require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster . \\nThis would imply the equation \\tincorrect in modern physics . \\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned : the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 Empedoclean \\telements move vertically up ( like fire , as is observed ) or down ( like earth ) towards their natural resting places . \\nIn the `` Physics '' ( 215a25 ) , Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional ( say , with constant c ) to its weight , W , and inversely \\tproportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling : ; Aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible . \\nOpinions have varied on whether Aristotle \\tintended to state quantitative laws . \\nHenri Carteron held the `` extreme view '' that Aristotle 's concept \\tof force was basically qualitative , but other authors reject this . \\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle 's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; \\tfloating depends in Archimedes ' scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not , as Aristotle thought , its elementary composition . \\nAristotle 's writings on motion remained \\tinfluential until the Early Modern period . \\nJohn Philoponus ( in the Middle Ages ) and Galileo are said to have shown by experiment \\tthat Aristotle 's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect . \\nA contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli , who argues that Aristotle 's physics of motion is correct within its \\tdomain of validity , that of objects in the Earth 's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air . \\nIn this system , heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones ( whether friction \\tis ignored , or not ) , and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium . \\nNewton 's `` forced '' motion corresponds to Aristotle 's `` violent '' motion with its external agent , but Aristotle 's assumption that the agent 's effect stops immediately it stops acting ( e.g. , the ball leaves the thrower 's hand \\t) has awkward consequences : he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus . \\nFour \\tcauses . \\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can \\tbe attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors . \\nHis term `` aitia '' is traditionally translated as `` cause '' , but it does not always refer to temporal \\tsequence ; it might be better translated as `` explanation '' , but the traditional rendering will be employed here . \\nOptics \\t. \\nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera \\tobscura in `` Problems '' , book 15 . \\nThe apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with \\ta small aperture that let light in . \\nWith it , he saw that whatever shape he made \\tthe hole , the sun 's image always remained circular . \\nHe also noted that increasing the distance between the \\taperture and the image surface magnified the image . \\nChance and \\tspontaneity . \\nAccording to Aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things \\t, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity . \\nChance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of \\taccidental things , `` from what is spontaneous '' . \\nThere is also more a specific kind of chance , which Aristotle names \\t`` luck '' , that only applies to people 's moral choices . \\nAstronomy \\t. \\nIn astronomy , Aristotle refuted Democritus 's claim that the Milky Way was made up of `` those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun 's rays , '' pointing out correctly that if `` the size of the sun \\tis greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . '' \\nGeology and \\tnatural sciences . \\nAristotle was one of the first \\tpeople to record any geological observations . \\nHe stated that geological change was too slow \\tto be observed in one person 's lifetime . \\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change , including `` lakes that had dried up '' and `` deserts that had become watered by rivers '' , giving as \\texamples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer , and `` the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption . '' ' \\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and \\tmeteorology ( including his major writings `` Meteorologica '' ) . \\nFor example , he made some of the earliest observations about desalination : he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated , freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by \\tthe cycle of rainfall and river runoff ( `` I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again . '' ) \\nBiology \\t. \\nEmpirical \\tresearch . \\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , \\tand biology forms a large part of his writings . \\nHe spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding \\tseas , including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos . \\nHis data in `` History of Animals '' , `` Generation of Animals '' , `` Movement of Animals '' , and `` Parts of Animals '' are \\tassembled from his own observations , statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen , and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas . \\nHis apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident : his works on \\tbotany have been lost , but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived . \\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation \\ton Lesbos and the catches of fishermen . \\nHe describes the catfish , electric ray , and frogfish in detail \\t, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus . \\nHis description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods , used in \\tsexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until the 19th century . \\nHe gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants , \\tand of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark . \\nHe notes that an animal 's structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the heron , which lives in marshes with soft mud and \\tlives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear-like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet . \\nDarwin , too , noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal \\t, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution . \\nAristotle 's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while Aristotle \\twas aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents . \\nFor Aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in \\twinter , must be considered distinct from natural causes . \\nHe was thus critical of Empedocles 's materialist theory of a `` survival of the fittest '' origin \\tof living things and their organs , and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results . \\nTo put his views into modern terms , he nowhere says that different species can have a common \\tancestor , or that one kind can change into another , or that kinds can become extinct . \\nScientific \\tstyle . \\nAristotle did not do experiments \\tin the modern sense . \\nHe used the ancient Greek term `` pepeiramenoi '' to \\tmean observations , or at most investigative procedures like dissection . \\nIn `` Generation of Animals '' , he finds a fertilized hen 's egg of \\ta suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo 's heart beating inside . \\nInstead , he practiced a different style of science : systematically gathering data , discovering \\tpatterns common to whole groups of animals , and inferring possible causal explanations from these . \\n; This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of \\tdata become available in a new field , such as genomics . \\nIt does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it \\tsets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed . \\nIn this sense , Aristotle \\t's biology is scientific . \\nFrom the data he collected and documented , Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating \\tthe life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods ( terrestrial placental mammals ) that he studied . \\nAmong these correct predictions \\tare the following . \\nBrood size decreases with ( adult ) body mass , so that an elephant \\thas fewer young ( usually just one ) per brood than a mouse . \\nLifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants \\tlive longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier . \\nAs a final example , fecundity decreases with lifespan , so long-lived kinds \\tlike elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice . \\nClassification of \\tliving things . \\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the `` History of Animals '' in a graded \\tscale of perfection , a nonreligious version of the `` scala naturae '' , with man at the top . \\nHis system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth \\t: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral-like eggs . \\nAnimals came above plants , and \\tthese in turn were above minerals . \\nHe grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter `` animals with \\tblood '' , and below them the colder invertebrates as `` animals without blood '' . \\nThose with blood were divided into the live-bearing ( mammals ) \\t, and the egg-laying ( birds , reptiles , fish ) . \\nThose without blood were insects , crustacea ( non-shelled – cephalopods , \\tand shelled ) and the hard-shelled molluscs ( bivalves and gastropods ) . \\nHe recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and \\tnoted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods . \\nTo a modern biologist , the explanation , \\tnot available to Aristotle , is convergent evolution . \\nPhilosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in \\ttaxonomy , but zoologists who studied this question recently think otherwise . \\nHe believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes ; this \\tteleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design . \\nPsychology \\t. \\nSoul \\t. \\nAristotle 's psychology , given in his treatise `` On the Soul '' ( `` peri psychēs '' ) , posits three \\tkinds of soul ( `` psyches '' ) : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul . \\nHumans have a \\trational soul . \\nThe human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds : Like the vegetative soul it can \\tgrow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally . \\nThe unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and \\tto compare them using the `` nous '' ( intellect ) and `` logos '' ( reason ) . \\nFor Aristotle , the soul is \\tthe form of a living being . \\nBecause all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings \\tis that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g . \\nthe ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , \\tgrowth and chemical transformations , which Aristotle considers types of movement ) . \\nIn contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the Egyptians , \\the placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain . \\nNotable is Aristotle 's division of sensation and thought , which generally differed \\tfrom the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of Alcmaeon . \\nIn `` On the Soul '' , Aristotle famously criticizes Plato 's theory \\tof the soul and develops his own in response to Plato 's . \\nThe first criticism is against Plato 's view of the soul in the `` Timaeus '' \\tthat the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies . \\n20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle 's interpretation of \\tPlato and maintained that he had misunderstood Plato . \\nToday 's scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle \\t's interpretation and have warmed up to it . \\nAristotle 's other criticism is that Plato 's view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to \\tbe mis-matched ; in principle , Aristotle alleges , any soul can go with any body , according to Plato 's theory . \\nAristotle 's claim that the soul is the form of a living \\tbeing is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation . \\nMemory \\t. \\nAccording to Aristotle in `` On the Soul '' , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience \\tin the mind and to distinguish between the internal `` appearance '' and an occurrence in the past . \\nIn other words , a memory is a mental \\tpicture ( phantasm ) that can be recovered . \\nAristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ \\tthat undergoes several changes in order to make a memory . \\nA memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex \\tthat the nervous system can not receive all the impressions at once . \\nThese changes are the same as those involved in \\tthe operations of sensation , Aristotelian , and thinking . \\nAristotle uses the term 'memory ' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , \\tand for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents . \\nMemory is of the past , prediction is of \\tthe future , and sensation is of the present . \\nRetrieval of impressions can \\tnot be performed suddenly . \\nA transitional channel is needed and located in past \\texperiences , both for previous experience and present experience . \\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them \\tas impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences . \\nTo search for these impressions , \\tpeople search the memory itself . \\nWithin the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , \\tthat person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for . \\nRecollection occurs when one retrieved \\texperience naturally follows another . \\nIf the chain of `` images '' is \\tneeded , one memory will stimulate the next . \\nWhen people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous \\texperiences until they reach the one that is needed . \\nRecollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving \\tthe information stored in a memory impression . \\nOnly humans can remember impressions of intellectual \\tactivity , such as numbers and words . \\nAnimals that have perception of time can \\tretrieve memories of their past observations . \\nRemembering involves only perception of the things \\tremembered and of the time passed . \\nAristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically \\tin relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his laws of association . \\nAristotle believed that past experiences \\tare hidden within the mind . \\nA force operates to awaken the hidden \\tmaterial to bring up the actual experience . \\nAccording to Aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates \\tupon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled . \\nDreams \\t. \\nAristotle describes sleep in `` \\tOn Sleep and Wakefulness '' . \\nSleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses \\tor of digestion , so it is vital to the body . \\nWhile a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , \\tsensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness . \\nSince a person can not sense during sleep they can \\tnot have desire , which is the result of sensation . \\nHowever , the senses are able to work during \\tsleep , albeit differently , unless they are weary . \\nDreams do not involve \\tactually sensing a stimulus . \\nIn dreams , sensation is still involved \\t, but in an altered manner . \\nAristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of \\twater , and then looks away , the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion . \\nWhen a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no \\tlonger the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression . \\nWhen the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly \\tencounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored . \\nHowever , during sleep the impressions made throughout the day \\tare noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences . \\nSo , dreams result \\tfrom these lasting impressions . \\nSince impressions are all that are left and not the exact \\tstimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience . \\nDuring sleep , a person is \\tin an altered state of mind . \\nAristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who \\tis overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus . \\nFor example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to \\tthink they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings . \\nSince a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements , \\tthey become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams , like the infatuated person . \\nThis leads the person to believe the dream is real \\t, even when the dreams are absurd in nature . \\nIn `` De Anima '' iii 3 , Aristotle ascribes the ability to create , to store , \\tand to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination , `` phantasia '' . \\nOne component of Aristotle 's theory of \\tdreams disagrees with previously held beliefs . \\nHe claimed that dreams are not foretelling \\tand not sent by a divine being . \\nAristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams \\tdo resemble future events are simply coincidences . \\nAristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the \\tfact that the person is asleep when they experience it . \\nIf a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see \\tsomething in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred . \\nSecondly , any sensory experience that is perceived while a person \\tis asleep does not qualify as part of a dream . \\nFor example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their \\tdream they hear a door is shut , this sensory experience is not part of the dream . \\nLastly , the images of dreams must be a \\tresult of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences . \\nPractical \\tphilosophy . \\nAristotle 's practical philosophy covers areas such as \\tethics , politics , economics , and rhetoric . \\nEthics \\t. \\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e. , one \\taimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake . \\nHe wrote several treatises on ethics , most \\tnotably including the `` Nicomachean Ethics '' . \\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper \\tfunction ( `` ergon '' ) of a thing . \\nAn eye is only a good eye in so much as it \\tcan see , because the proper function of an eye is sight . \\nAristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity \\tof the `` psuchē '' ( `` soul '' ) in accordance with reason ( `` logos '' ) . \\nAristotle identified such an optimum activity ( the virtuous mean , between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency ) of the soul as \\tthe aim of all human deliberate action , `` eudaimonia '' , generally translated as `` happiness '' or sometimes `` well-being '' . \\nTo have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( \\t`` ēthikē '' `` aretē '' ) , often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence . \\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately \\t, but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things . \\nWhen the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( `` phronesis '' ) and their intellect ( `` nous '' ) can develop \\twith each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nIn addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual \\t, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled `` Politics '' . \\nAristotle considered the city to \\tbe a natural community . \\nMoreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family , which in turn is \\tprior to the individual , `` for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part '' . \\nHe famously stated that `` man is by nature a political animal '' and argued \\tthat humanity 's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality . \\nAristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , \\tand as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others . \\nAristotle 's conception of the city is organic , and he is considered \\tone of the first to conceive of the city in this manner . \\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a \\tmodern state is quite different from Aristotle 's understanding . \\nAlthough he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to Aristotle was the city \\t( `` polis '' ) which functions as a political `` community '' or `` partnership '' ( `` koinōnia '' ) . \\nThe aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and \\tto perform beautiful acts : `` The political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together . '' \\nThis is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave \\tthe state of nature because of `` fear of violent death '' or its `` inconveniences '' . \\nIn `` Protrepticus '' , the character 'Aristotle ' states : As Plato 's disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and , following the outline of certain ideas from Plato 's `` Statesman '' , he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed \\tstate : To illustrate this approach , Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting , albeit textually described , where the democratic principle of `` one voter–one vote '' is combined with the oligarchic `` merit-weighted voting '' ; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see . \\nEconomics \\t. \\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , \\tespecially to thought in the Middle Ages . \\nIn `` Politics '' , Aristotle addresses \\tthe city , property , and trade . \\nHis response to criticisms of private property , in Lionel Robbins 's view , anticipated later proponents of \\tprivate property among philosophers and economists , as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements . \\nAristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private \\tproperty is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature . \\nIn `` Politics '' , Aristotle offers one of \\tthe earliest accounts of the origin of money . \\nMoney came into use because people became dependent on one \\tanother , importing what they needed and exporting the surplus . \\nFor the sake of convenience , people then agreed to deal in something \\tthat is intrinsically useful and easily applicable , such as iron or silver . \\nAristotle 's discussions on retail and interest was a \\tmajor influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages . \\nHe had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure \\tthings one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit . \\nIt thus uses goods as a means to an \\tend , rather than as an end unto itself . \\nHe believed that retail trade \\twas in this way unnatural . \\nSimilarly , Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes \\ta gain out of the money itself , and not from its use . \\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money \\tthat was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time . \\nHe wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the \\tnumber of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement . \\nMoney thus allows for the association of different \\tgoods and makes them `` commensurable '' . \\nHe goes on to state that money is also useful \\tfor future exchange , making it a sort of security . \\nThat is , `` if we do not want a thing now , \\twe shall be able to get it when we do want it '' . \\nRhetoric and \\tpoetics . \\nAristotle 's `` Rhetoric '' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience : `` ethos '' ( an appeal to the \\tspeaker 's character ) , `` pathos '' ( an appeal to the audience 's emotion ) , and `` logos '' ( an appeal to logical reasoning ) . \\nHe also categorizes rhetoric into three genres : epideictic ( ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame ) , forensic ( judicial speeches \\tover guilt or innocence ) , and deliberative ( speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue ) . \\nAristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs : `` enthymeme '' ( \\tproof by syllogism ) and `` paradeigma '' ( proof by example ) . \\nAristotle writes in his `` Poetics '' that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance \\tare all fundamentally acts of `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner . \\nHe applies the term `` mimesis '' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the \\tartist 's intention and contends that the audience 's realisation of the `` mimesis '' is vital to understanding the work itself . \\nAristotle states that `` mimesis '' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans \\tfrom animals and that all human artistry `` follows the pattern of nature '' . \\nBecause of this , Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what \\tStephen Halliwell calls `` highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes . '' \\nFor example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony \\t, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language . \\nThe forms also differ in \\ttheir object of imitation . \\nComedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse \\tthan average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . \\nLastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or \\tcharacter , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . \\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle 's `` Poetics '' originally comprised two books – one \\ton comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived . \\nAristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot-structure , \\tcharacter , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry . \\nThe characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; \\tand the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy . \\nTragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , \\tand is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions . \\nAristotle concludes `` Poetics '' with a discussion on which , \\tif either , is superior : epic or tragic mimesis . \\nHe suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , \\tis more unified , and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic . \\nAristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school \\thad a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop . \\nViews on \\twomen . \\nAristotle 's analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine \\telement bringing life to an inert , passive female element . \\nThe biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction , which changes her \\tbody temperature , which in turn makes her , in Aristotle 's view , incapable of participating in political life . \\nOn this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics \\thave accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism . \\nHowever , Aristotle gave equal weight to women 's happiness as he did to men 's , and commented in \\this `` Rhetoric '' that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men . \\nInfluence \\t. \\nMore than 2300 years after his death , Aristotle remains \\tone of the most influential people who ever lived . \\nHe contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in \\texistence , and he was the founder of many new fields . \\nAccording to the philosopher Bryan Magee , `` it is doubtful whether \\tany human being has ever known as much as he did '' . \\nAmong countless other achievements , Aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology \\t, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method . \\nTaneli Kukkonen , writing in `` The Classical Tradition '' , observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched , and his reach \\tin influencing `` every branch of intellectual enterprise '' including Western ethical and political theory , theology , rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long . \\nAs a result , Kukkonen argues , any analysis of reality today `` will \\talmost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind . '' \\nJonathan Barnes wrote that `` an account of Aristotle 's intellectual afterlife \\twould be little less than a history of European thought '' . \\nOn his successor \\t, Theophrastus . \\nAristotle 's pupil and successor , Theophrastus , wrote the `` \\tHistory of Plants '' , a pioneering work in botany . \\nSome of his technical terms remain in use , such as carpel from `` carpos \\t'' , fruit , and pericarp , from `` pericarpion '' , seed chamber . \\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than \\tAristotle was , instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned . \\nOn later \\tGreek philosophers . \\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle 's work was felt \\tas the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school . \\nAristotle 's students included Aristoxenus , Dicaearchus , Demetrius of Phalerum , Eudemos of \\tRhodes , Harpalus , Hephaestion , Mnason of Phocis , Nicomachus , and Theophrastus . \\nAristotle 's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter 's bringing \\twith him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers . \\nHe had also learned a great deal about \\tPersian customs and traditions from his teacher . \\nAlthough his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle 's geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , Alexander complained `` \\tThou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men 's common property ? '' \\nOn Hellenistic \\tscience . \\nAfter Theophrastus , the Lyceum failed \\tto produce any original work . \\nThough interest in Aristotle 's ideas survived \\t, they were generally taken unquestioningly . \\nIt is not until the age of Alexandria under the \\tPtolemies that advances in biology can be again found . \\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria , Herophilus of Chalcedon , corrected Aristotle , placing \\tintelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation . \\nHerophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting \\tthat the latter pulse while the former do not . \\nThough a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life , teleology ( and after \\tthe rise of Christianity , natural theology ) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries . \\nErnst Mayr states that there was `` nothing of any real \\tconsequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance . '' \\nOn Byzantine \\tscholars . \\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle \\tby copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus . \\nThe first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus , Elias , and \\tDavid in the sixth century , and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century . \\nJohn Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle 's views on \\tthe eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of Aristotelian thought . \\nPhiloponus questioned Aristotle 's teaching of physics , noting its flaws \\tand introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations . \\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus \\treappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena . \\nOn the medieval \\tIslamic world . \\nAristotle was one of the most revered \\tWestern thinkers in early Islamic theology . \\nMost of the still extant works of Aristotle , as well as a number of the original \\tGreek commentaries , were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars . \\nAverroes , Avicenna and Alpharabius , who wrote on Aristotle in great \\tdepth , also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers . \\nAlkindus greatly admired Aristotle 's philosophy , and Averroes spoke of \\tAristotle as the `` exemplar '' for all future philosophers . \\nMedieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle \\tas the `` First Teacher '' . \\nThe title was later used by Western philosophers ( as in the famous \\tpoem of Dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy . \\nOn medieval \\tEurope . \\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West , Aristotle was practically unknown there \\tfrom c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the `` Organon '' made by Boethius . \\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made , both from Arabic translations , such \\tas those by Gerard of Cremona , and from the original Greek , such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke . \\nAfter the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his `` Summa Theologica '' , working from Moerbeke 's translations and calling Aristotle `` The Philosopher '' , the demand \\tfor Aristotle 's writings grew , and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West , stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance . \\nThese thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity , bringing \\tthe thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages . \\nScholars such as Boethius , Peter Abelard , \\tand John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic . \\nThe medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having A cautionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander \\tto avoid the king 's seductive mistress , Phyllis , but was himself captivated by her , and allowed her to ride him . \\nPhyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect , and he witnessed Phyllis proving \\tthat a woman 's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher 's male intellect . \\nArtists such as Hans Baldung produced a \\tseries of illustrations of the popular theme . \\nThe Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in `` The Divine Comedy '' : Besides Dante \\t's fellow poets , the classical figure that most influenced the `` Comedy '' is Aristotle . \\nDante built up the philosophy of the `` Comedy '' with the works of Aristotle as \\ta foundation , just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking . \\nDante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works \\tand indirectly through quotations in the works of Albert Magnus . \\nDante even acknowledges Aristotle 's influence explicitly in the poem , specifically when \\tVirgil justifies the Inferno 's structure by citing the `` Nicomachean Ethics '' . \\nOn medieval \\tJudaism . \\nMoses Maimonides ( considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism ) adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars \\tand based his `` Guide for the Perplexed '' on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy . \\nMaimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived \\t, and styled him as the `` chief of the philosophers '' . \\nAlso , in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon , Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers \\twho preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are `` sufficient by themselves and [ superior ] to all that were written before them . \\nHis intellect , Aristotle 's is the extreme limit of human intellect , apart from him upon whom the divine emanation \\thas flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy , there being no level higher '' . \\nOn Early \\tModern scientists . \\nIn the Early Modern period , scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories \\tof Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment . \\nHarvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than \\tbeing the seat of the soul and the controller of the body 's heat , as Aristotle thought . \\nGalileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle 's physics , proposing \\tthat bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight . \\nOn 18th/19th-century \\tthinkers . \\nThe 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to \\thave taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle . \\nAristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ( `` \\tnatural slaves '' ) , and the natural superiority ( virtue , `` arete '' ) of others . \\nIt was Martin Heidegger , not Nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation \\tof Aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition . \\nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle 's logic , but decided `` to go under , over , \\tand beyond '' it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book `` The Laws of Thought '' . \\nThis gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and \\tallows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two . \\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most \\timportant contributor to the subject of biology . \\nIn an 1882 letter he wrote that `` Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods \\t, though in very different ways , but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle '' . \\nAlso , in later editions of the book `` On the Origin of Species ' , Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far \\tback as Aristotle ; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles . \\nJames Joyce 's favoured philosopher was Aristotle , whom he considered \\tto be `` the greatest thinker of all times '' . \\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge said : Everybody is \\tborn either a Platonist or an Aristotelian . \\nAyn Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy \\tshe could only recommend `` three A 's '' —Aristotle , Aquinas , and Ayn Rand . \\nShe also regarded Aristotle as \\tthe greatest of all philosophers . \\nKarl Marx considered Aristotle to be the `` greatest thinker of antiquity '' , and called him \\ta `` giant thinker '' , a `` genius '' , and `` the great scholar '' . \\nModern rejection \\tand rehabilitation . \\nDuring the 20th century , Aristotle \\t's work was widely criticized . \\nThe philosopher Bertrand Russell argued that `` almost every serious intellectual advance \\thas had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine '' . \\nRussell called Aristotle 's ethics `` repulsive '' , and labelled \\this logic `` as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy '' . \\nRussell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle \\t, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors . \\nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by `` proceed \\t[ ing ] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character '' on limited evidence from their senses . \\nIn 1985 , the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in `` pure seventeenth century '' tones that Aristotle had assembled `` a \\tstrange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility '' . \\nBy the start of the 21st century , however , Aristotle was taken more seriously : Kukkonen noted that `` In \\tthe best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition . '' \\nAlasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way \\tthat is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans . \\nKukkonen observed , too , that `` that most enduring of romantic images , Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander '' remained current , as in the 2004 \\tfilm `` Alexander '' , while the `` firm rules '' of Aristotle 's theory of drama have ensured a role for the `` Poetics '' in Hollywood . \\nBiologists continue to be interested \\tin Aristotle 's thinking . \\nArmand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle 's biology , while Niko Tinbergen 's four questions , based on Aristotle 's \\tfour causes , are used to analyse animal behaviour ; they examine function , phylogeny , mechanism , and ontogeny . \\nSurviving \\tworks . \\nCorpus \\tAristotelicum . \\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through \\tmedieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum . \\nThese texts , as opposed to Aristotle 's lost works \\t, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle 's school . \\nReference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker 's Royal Prussian Academy edition ( `` Aristotelis Opera edidit \\tAcademia Regia Borussica '' , Berlin , 1831–1870 ) , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works . \\nLoss and \\tpreservation . \\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls , \\tthe common writing medium of that era . \\nHis writings are divisible into two groups : the `` exoteric '' , intended for \\tthe public , and the `` esoteric '' , for use within the Lyceum school . \\nAristotle 's `` lost '' works stray considerably \\tin characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus . \\nWhereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to \\tsubsequent publication , the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication . \\nCicero 's description of Aristotle 's literary style as `` a river of gold \\t'' must have applied to the published works , not the surviving notes . \\nA major question in the history of Aristotle 's works is how the exoteric writings \\twere all lost , and how the ones now possessed came to be found . \\nThe consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle 's school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them \\tfrom those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today . \\nLegacy \\t. \\nDepictions \\t. \\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder , Justus van Gent , \\tRaphael , Paolo Veronese , Jusepe de Ribera , Rembrandt , and Francesco Hayez over the centuries . \\nAmong the best-known depictions is Raphael 's fresco `` The School of Athens '' , in the Vatican 's Apostolic Palace , \\twhere the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image , at the architectural vanishing point , reflecting their importance . \\nRembrandt 's `` Aristotle with a Bust of Homer '' , too , is a celebrated work , showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age : as the art critic \\tJonathan Jones writes , `` this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world , ensnaring us in its musty , glowing , pitch-black , terrible knowledge of time . '' \\nEponyms \\t. \\nThe Aristotle Mountains in Antarctica \\tare named after Aristotle . \\nHe was the first person known to conjecture , in his book `` Meteorology '' , \\tthe existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and called it `` Antarctica '' . \\nAristoteles is a crater on the Moon bearing \\tthe classical form of Aristotle 's name . \\nFurther \\treading . \\nThe secondary literature on \\tAristotle is vast . \\nThe following is only \\ta small selection . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 309 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=309 '' title= '' An American in Paris '' \\t> An American in Paris An American in Paris is a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer George Gershwin first performed in 1928 . \\nIt was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris and \\tevokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the `` '' . \\nGershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the \\tsymphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns . \\nHe brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition , which took place \\ton December 13 , 1928 , in Carnegie Hall , with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic . \\nIt was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his Concerto in F \\tfollowing the earlier success of `` Rhapsody in Blue '' ( 1924 ) . \\nHe completed the orchestration on November 18 , less \\tthan four weeks before the work 's premiere . \\nHe collaborated on the original program notes \\twith critic and composer Deems Taylor . \\nBackground \\t. \\nAlthough the story is likely apocryphal , Gershwin is said to have been attracted by Maurice Ravel 's unusual \\tchords , and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel . \\nAfter his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , Ravel said he could not \\tteach him , saying , `` Why be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin ? '' \\nGershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to \\tthe United States for a tour . \\nTo this end , upon his return to New York , Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel 's friend Robert Schmitz , a pianist Ravel had met during the war , to urge Ravel to tour the \\tU.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica , promoting Franco-American musical relations , and was able to offer Ravel a $ 10,000 fee for the tour , an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel . \\nGershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during \\ta party held for Ravel 's birthday by Éva Gauthier . \\nRavel 's tour reignited Gershwin 's desire to return to Paris \\t, which he and his brother Ira did after meeting Ravel . \\nRavel 's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Nadia Boulanger caused \\tGershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris . \\nYet after he played for her , she \\ttold him she could not teach him . \\nBoulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students \\t: `` What could I give you that you have n't already got ? '' \\nThis did not set Gershwin back , as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based \\ton Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his `` Rhapsody in Blue '' . \\nParis at this time hosted many expatriate writers , among them Ezra Pound \\t, W. B. Yeats , Ernest Hemingway , and artist Pablo Picasso . \\nComposition \\t. \\nGershwin based `` An American in Paris '' on a melodic fragment called `` Very Parisienne '' , written \\tin 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts , Robert and Mabel Schirmer . \\nGershwin called it `` a rhapsodic ballet '' ; it is written \\tfreely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works . \\nGershwin explained in `` Musical America '' , `` My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in \\tParis as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the French atmosphere . '' \\nThe piece is structured into five sections , \\twhich culminate in a loose ABA format . \\nGershwin 's first A episode introduces the two main `` walking '' themes in the `` \\tAllegretto grazioso '' and develops a third theme in the `` Subito con brio '' . \\nThe style of this A section is written in the \\ttypical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six . \\nThis A section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies \\twith the sounds of oboe , English horn , and taxi horns . \\nThe B section 's `` Andante ma con ritmo deciso \\t'' introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness . \\nThe `` Allegro '' that follows continues to \\texpress homesickness in a faster twelve-bar blues . \\nIn the B section , Gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and \\tbluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum . \\n`` Moderato con grazia '' is the last A \\tsection that returns to the themes set in A . \\nAfter recapitulating the `` walking '' themes , Gershwin overlays the slow \\tblues theme from section B in the final `` Grandioso '' . \\nResponse \\t. \\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch 's interpretation at \\tthe world premiere of `` An American in Paris '' . \\nHe stated that Damrosch 's sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to \\twalk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work . \\nThe audience , according to Edward Cushing , responded with `` a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine \\tin contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses . '' \\nCritics believed that `` An American in Paris '' was better crafted than Gershwin 's Concerto in F. Some did not \\tthink it belonged in a program with classical composers César Franck , Richard Wagner , or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere . \\nGershwin responded to the \\tcritics : Instrumentation . \\n`` An American in Paris '' was originally scored for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubling on piccolo ) , 2 oboes , English horn , 2 clarinets in B-flat , bass clarinet in B-flat , 2 bassoons , 4 horns in F , 3 trumpets in B-flat , 3 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass \\tdrum , triangle , wood block , ratchet , cymbals , low and high tom-toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 4 taxi horns labeled as A , B , C , and D with circles around them , alto saxophone , tenor saxophone , baritone saxophone ( all doubling soprano and alto saxophones ) , and strings . \\nAlthough most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A , B , C , and D \\t, it had been Gershwin 's intention to use the notes A4 , B4 , D5 , and A3 . \\nIt is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A , B , C , and D \\twith circles , he was referring to the four horns , and not the notes that they played . \\nA major revision of the work by composer and arranger F. Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only \\tthree instruments : alto , tenor and baritone ; the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments . \\nThis became the standard performing edition until 2000 , when Gershwin specialist Jack Gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of `` An American \\tin Paris '' , working directly from Gershwin 's original manuscript , including the restoration of Gershwin 's soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson 's revision . \\nGibbons ' restored orchestration of `` An American in Paris '' was performed at London 's Queen Elizabeth \\tHall on July 9 , 2000 , by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian . \\nWilliam Daly arranged the score for piano solo ; \\tthis was published by New World Music in 1929 . \\nPreservation \\tstatus . \\nOn September 22 , 2013 , it was announced that a musicological \\tcritical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released . \\nThe Gershwin family , working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan \\t, were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin 's true intent . \\nIt was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the \\tblues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ) , or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin 's composition process . \\nThe score to `` An American in Paris '' was scheduled to \\tbe issued first in a series of scores to be released . \\nThe entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete , but `` \\tAn American in Paris '' was planned to be an early volume in the series . \\nTwo urtext editions of the work were published \\tby the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015 . \\nThe changes made by Campbell-Watson \\twere withdrawn in both editions . \\nIn the extended urtext , 120 \\tbars of music were re-integrated . \\nConductor Walter Damrosch had cut them \\tshortly before the first performance . \\nOn September 9 , 2017 , The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave the world premiere of the long-awaited critical edition \\tof the piece prepared by Mark Clague , director of the Gershwin initiative at the University of Michigan . \\nThis performance was of \\tthe original 1928 orchestration . \\nRecordings \\t. \\n`` An American in Paris \\t'' has been frequently recorded . \\nThe first recording was made for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929 with Nathaniel \\tShilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra , drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra . \\nGershwin was on hand to `` supervise '' the recording ; however , Shilkret was \\treported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio . \\nThen , a little later , Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so \\the hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo ; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording . \\nThis recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended \\tusing the notes A-flat , B-flat , a higher D , and a lower A . \\nThe radio broadcast of the September 8 , 1937 , Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert , in which `` An American in Paris \\t, '' also conducted by Shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set . \\nArthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA \\tVictor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music . \\nIn 1945 , Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the piece for RCA Victor \\t, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer . \\nThe Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin 's original score , \\tbefore he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today . \\nHarry James released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album `` One Night Stand , \\t'' recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago ( Columbia GL 522 and CL 522 ) . \\nUse in \\tfilm . \\nIn 1951 , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film , `` An \\tAmerican in Paris '' , featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron . \\nWinning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar , and numerous other awards , the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli , featured many tunes of Gershwin , and concluded with an \\textensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the `` An American in Paris '' symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by Johnny Green ) , costing $ 500,000 . \\nExternal \\tlinks . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 316 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ?

curid=324 '' title= '' Academy Awards '' > Academy Awards \\tThe Academy Awards , better known as the Oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit for the American and international film industry . \\nThe awards are regarded by many as the most \\tprestigious , significant awards in the entertainment industry worldwide . \\nGiven annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , the awards are \\tan international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements , as assessed by the Academy 's voting membership . \\nThe various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy , officially called the `` \\tAcademy Award of Merit '' , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the `` Oscar '' . \\nThe statuette , depicting a knight rendered in the Art Deco style , was originally sculpted \\tby Los Angeles artist George Stanley from a design sketch by art director Cedric Gibbons . \\nThe 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929 at a private \\tdinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel . \\nThe Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in \\t1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . \\nIt is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards \\tceremony and is now televised live worldwide . \\nIt is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards ; its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for \\ttelevision , the Tony Awards for theater , and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards . \\nA total of 3,140 Oscar statuettes have \\tbeen awarded since its inception in 1929 . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16 , 1929 , at a \\tprivate dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people . \\nThe post-awards party was held \\tat the Mayfair Hotel . \\nThe cost of guest tickets for that night 's ceremony \\twas $ 5 ( $ at 2020 prices ) . \\nFifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the \\tfilm-making industry of the time , for their works during the 1927–28 period . \\nThe ceremony ran \\tfor 15 minutes . \\nFor this first ceremony , winners were \\tannounced to the media three months earlier . \\nFor the second ceremony in 1930 , and the rest of the first decade , the \\tresults were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards . \\nIn 1940 , the `` Los Angeles Times '' announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a \\tresult , the following year the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners . \\nThe term `` Oscar '' is a registered trademark of the AMPAS ; however , in the Italian language \\t, it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony , regardless of which field . \\nMilestones \\t. \\nThe first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings , for his performances in \\t`` The Last Command '' and `` The Way of All Flesh '' . \\nHe had to return to Europe before the ceremony , so the Academy agreed to give \\thim the prize earlier ; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history . \\nAt that time , winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , Jannings \\treceived the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films . \\nWith the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and \\tprofessionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . \\nFor the first six ceremonies , the \\teligibility period spanned two calendar years . \\nAt the 29th ceremony , held in 1957 , the Best Foreign Language \\tFilm category , now known as Best International Feature Film , was introduced . \\nUntil then , foreign-language films had been \\thonored with the Special Achievement Award . \\nPerhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel , who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy \\tChandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974 . \\nBemused host David Niven quipped , `` Is n't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh \\tthat man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings ? '' \\nLater , evidence arose suggesting that Opel 's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show 's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler , the show 's business manager , believed that the incident had been \\tplanned in some way ; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler 's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line , which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be . \\nThe 74th Academy Awards , held in 2002 , \\tpresented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature . \\nFrom 1973 to 2020 , all Academy Awards ceremonies \\thave ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture . \\nFor 2021 , this tradition was broken as the \\tceremony ended with the Academy Award for Best Actor . \\nTraditionally , the previous year 's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress \\t, while the previous year 's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor . \\nOn February 9 , 2020 , `` Parasite '' became the first foreign-language \\tfilm to win Best Picture at the award ceremony of 92nd Academy Awards . \\nTom Hanks announced at the 2020 Oscar Ceremony , the opening of \\tthe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on December 14 , 2020 . \\nThe museum development started in 2017 under Kerry Brougher \\t, but is now led by Bill Kramer . \\nThe industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture , the art & amp ; science of film making , exhibiting trailblazing \\tdirectors , actors , film-makers , sound editors and more , and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like Dorothy 's Ruby Red Slippers . \\nThe 93rd Academy Awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021 , was held on April 25 , 2021 , \\tafter it was postponed from its original February 28 , 2021 , schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema . \\nAs with two previous ceremonies \\t, there was no host . \\nThe ceremony was \\tbroadcast on ABC . \\nIt took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles , California for the 19th consecutive \\tyear , along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles . \\nBecause of the virus impact on films and TV industries , Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony \\t, streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible , though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return . \\nOscar \\tstatuette . \\nAcademy Award \\tof Merit . \\nThe best known award is the Academy Award of \\tMerit , more popularly known as the Oscar statuette . \\nMade of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base , it is 13.5 in ( 34.3 cm ) tall , weighs 8.5 lb ( 3.856 \\tkg ) , and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes . \\nThe five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy : \\tActors , Writers , Directors , Producers , and Technicians . \\nSculptor George Stanley ( who also did the Muse Fountain \\tat the Hollywood Bowl ) sculpted Cedric Gibbons ' design . \\nThe statuettes presented at the initial \\tceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze . \\nWithin a few years , the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal , a pewter-like \\talloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 24-karat gold . \\nDue to a metal shortage during World War II , \\tOscars were made of painted plaster for three years . \\nFollowing the war , the Academy invited recipients to \\tredeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones . \\nThe only addition to the Oscar since it was \\tcreated is a minor streamlining of the base . \\nThe original Oscar mold was cast \\tin 1928 at the C.W . \\nShumway & amp ; Sons Foundry in Batavia , Illinois , which also contributed \\tto casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award 's statuettes . \\nFrom 1983 to 2015 , approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with \\tgold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S . \\nOwens & amp \\t; Company . \\nIt would take between three and \\tfour weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes . \\nIn 2016 , the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes \\t, handing manufacturing duties to Walden , New York-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry . \\nWhile based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar \\t, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal . \\nCast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished , they are \\tthen electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn , New York–based Epner Technology . \\nThe time required to produce 50 \\tsuch statuettes is roughly three months . \\nR.S \\t. \\nOwens is expected to continue producing other awards for \\tthe Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating . \\nNaming \\t. \\nThe Academy officially adopted the name `` \\tOscar '' for the trophies in 1939 . \\nHowever , the origin of \\tthe nickname is disputed . \\nOne biography of Bette Davis , who was a president of the Academy in 1941 , \\tclaims she named the award after her first husband , band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson . \\nA frequently mentioned originator is Margaret Herrick , the Academy executive director , who , when she first saw the award \\tin 1931 , said the statuette reminded her of `` Uncle Oscar '' , a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce . \\nColumnist Sidney Skolsky , who was present during Herrick 's naming in 1931 , \\twrote that `` Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar ' . '' \\nThe Academy credits Skolsky with `` the first confirmed newspaper reference '' to `` Oscar '' in his \\tcolumn on March 16 , 1934 , which was written about that year 's 6th Academy Awards . \\nThe 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of \\t`` Oscar '' : a `` Time '' magazine story . \\nIn the ceremonies that year , Walt Disney was the first to \\tthank the Academy for his `` Oscar '' during his acceptance speech . \\nBruce Davis , in preparing a history of the awards for his book `` The Academy and the Award '' , found that the term `` Oscar '' had \\tcome from Eleanore Lilleberg , a secretary within the Academy when the award was first introduced , as she had been in charge of pre-ceremony handling of the awards . \\nDavis found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg , Eleanore 's brother , that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army \\tveteran named Oscar the two knew in Chicago , who Einar described as `` stood straight and tall '' . \\nIn 2021 , Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the likely first public mention of the name `` Oscar '' , \\tin journalist Relman Morin 's column `` Cinematters '' in the `` Los Angeles Evening Post-Record '' on December 5 , 1933 . \\nAs the award did not take place that year , Relman Morin \\twrote : `` What 's happened to the annual Academy banquet ? \\nAs a rule , the banquet and the awarding of `` Oscar '' the \\tbronze statuette given for best performances , is all over long before this . '' \\nThis information changes the question of Sidney Skolsky \\tas the first to publicly name the name . \\nEngraving \\t. \\nTo prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the \\tceremony , Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates . \\nUntil 2010 , winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to \\twait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars . \\nSince 2010 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at \\tan inscription-processing station at the Governor 's Ball , a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony . \\nThe \\tR.S . \\nOwens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony \\t, bearing the name of every potential winner . \\nThe nameplates for the non-winning \\tnominees are later recycled . \\nOwnership of \\tOscar statuettes . \\nPrior to 1950 , Oscar statuettes were ( \\tand remain ) the property of the recipient . \\nSince then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette \\tbe first offered for sale back to the Academy for US $ 1 . \\nIf a winner refuses to agree to this \\tstipulation , then the Academy keeps the statuette . \\nAcademy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in \\tpublic auctions and private deals for six-figure sums . \\nIn 1989 , Michael Todd 's grandson tried to sell Todd 's Best Picture Oscar for his \\t1956 production of `` Around the World in 80 Days '' to a movie prop collector . \\nThe Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract \\tby gaining a permanent injunction against the sale . \\nIn 1992 , Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `` The Best \\tYears of Our Lives '' to auction to raise money for his wife 's medical expenses . \\nThough his decision caused controversy , the first-ever Oscar to be sold passed to a \\tprivate collector on August 6 , 1992 for $ 60,500 ( $ today ) . \\nRussell defended his action , saying , `` I \\tdo n't know why anybody would be critical . \\nMy wife 's health is much \\tmore important than sentimental reasons . \\nThe movie will be here , \\teven if Oscar is n't . '' \\nIn December 2011 , Orson Welles ' 1941 Oscar for `` Citizen Kane '' ( Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ) was put up for \\tauction , after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy . \\nOn December 20 , 2011 , it sold in an \\tonline auction for US $ 861,542 ( $ today ) . \\nSome buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the \\tAcademy , which keeps them in its treasury . \\nOther awards presented \\tby the Academy . \\nIn addition to the Academy Award of Merit ( Oscar award ) , there are nine honorary ( non-competitive ) awards presented by the Academy from time to time ( except \\tfor the Academy Honorary Award , the Technical Achievement Award , and the Student Academy Awards , which are presented annually ) : The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting . \\nNomination \\t. \\nFrom 2004 to 2020 , the Academy Award nomination \\tresults were announced to the public in mid-January . \\nPrior to that , the results \\twere announced in early February . \\nIn 2021 , the nominees \\twere announced in March . \\nIn 2022 , the nominees were announced in \\tearly February for the first time since 2003 . \\nVoters \\t. \\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , \\ta professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of over 7,000 . \\nAcademy membership is divided into different branches , with \\teach representing a different discipline in film production . \\nActors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 1,311 members \\t( 22 percent ) of the Academy 's composition . \\nVotes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers ( and its \\tpredecessor Price Waterhouse ) since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935 . \\nThe firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a \\tdue date sometime in January of the next year , then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours . \\nAll AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board \\tof Governors , on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees . \\nMembership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit \\ta name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures . \\nNew membership proposals \\tare considered annually . \\nThe Academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 2007 \\tpress releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join . \\nThe 2007 release also stated that it \\thas just under 6,000 voting members . \\nWhile the membership had been growing , stricter \\tpolicies have kept its size steady since then . \\nIn 2012 , the results of a study conducted by the `` Los Angeles Times '' \\twere published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 % of AMPAS ' voting membership . \\nOf the 5,100+ active voters confirmed , 94 % were Caucasian , 77 % were \\tmale , and 54 % were found to be over the age of 60 . \\n33 % of voting members are former nominees ( \\t14 % ) and winners ( 19 % ) . \\nIn May 2011 , the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so \\tvoting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013 . \\nRules \\t. \\nAccording to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December \\t31 , in Los Angeles County , California , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the Best International Feature Film , Best Documentary Feature , and awards in short film categories ) . \\nAdditionally , the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run \\t, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6 pm and 10 pm local time . \\nFor example , the 2009 Best Picture winner , `` The Hurt Locker '' , was originally first released in 2008 , but did not qualify \\tfor the 2008 awards , as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009 , thus qualifying for the 2009 awards . \\nForeign films must include English subtitles , and each country can submit only \\tone film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year . \\nRule 2 states that a film must be feature-length , defined as a minimum of 40 minutes , except for short-subject awards , and it must exist either on a \\t35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels . \\nSince the 90th Academy Awards , presented in 2018 , multi-part and \\tlimited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award . \\nThis followed the win of `` '' , an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited \\trelease before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN , in that category in 2017 . \\nThe Academy 's announcement of the new rule \\tmade no direct mention of that film . \\nThe Best International Feature Film award \\tdoes not require a U.S. release . \\nIt requires the film to be submitted \\tas its country 's official selection . \\nThe Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and New York City during the previous calendar year , or a qualifying award at a competitive film \\tfestival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list ( regardless of any public exhibition or distribution ) , or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country 's official selection . \\nThe qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as \\tthose for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings . \\nAdditionally , a film must have been reviewed by a critic from `` The New York Times '' , \\t`` Time Out New York '' , the `` Los Angeles Times '' , or `` LA Weekly '' . \\nProducers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not \\tsubmitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year . \\nThe form includes the production \\tcredits for all related categories . \\nThen , each form is checked and put \\tin a Reminder List of Eligible Releases . \\nAwards in short film categories ( Best Documentary Short Subject , Best Animated Short Film , and \\tBest Live Action Short Film ) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards . \\nFirst , the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year , instead of covering \\tone year starting on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony . \\nSecond , there are \\tmultiple methods of qualification . \\nThe main method is a week-long theatrical release in `` either '' Los \\tAngeles County `` or '' New York City during the eligibility period . \\nFilms also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film \\tfestivals designated by the Academy , also without regard to prior public distribution . \\nFinally , a film that is selected as a gold , silver , or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student \\tAcademy Awards is also eligible ( Documentary category for that award , and Animation , Narrative , Alternative , or International for the other awards ) . \\nThe requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are \\talso different from those for other awards . \\nOnly one screening per \\tday is required . \\nFor the Documentary award , the screening must start between noon and 10 pm local time ; for other awards , \\tno specific start time is required , but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times . \\nIn late December , ballots , and copies of the Reminder \\tList of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members . \\nFor most categories , members from each of the branches vote \\tto determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( i.e . \\nonly directors vote for directors , writers for writers \\t, actors for actors , etc . ) . \\nIn the special case of Best Picture , all \\tvoting members are eligible to select the nominees . \\nIn all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each \\tmember casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for Best Picture ) ranked preferentially . \\nIn certain categories , including International Feature Film , Documentary and Animated Feature , \\tnominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches . \\nIn most categories , the winner is selected from \\tamong the nominees by plurality voting of all members . \\nSince 2009 , the Best Picture winner \\thas been chosen by instant runoff voting . \\nSince 2013 , re-weighted range voting has been used \\tto select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects . \\nFilm companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running \\tfor Best Picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season . \\nThe Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to \\ttry to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . \\nIt has an awards czar on staff who advises \\tmembers on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . \\nFor example , a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee `` The Hurt Locker '' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted \\tassociates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner ( `` The Hurt Locker '' eventually won ) . \\nAcademy Screening \\tRoom . \\nThe Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the \\tAcademy to view all eligible films ( except , initially , those in the International category ) in one place . \\nIt was introduced in 2019 , for the 2020 Oscars , \\tthough DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided . \\nFor films to be included on the platform , the North American distributor must pay $ 12,500 , including \\ta watermarking fee , and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy . \\nThe platform can be accessed via \\tApple TV and Roku players . \\nThe watermarking process involved several video security firms , creating a forensic \\twatermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings . \\nIn 2021 , for the 2022 Oscars , the Academy banned all physical screeners \\tand in-person screenings , restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room . \\nFilms eligible in the Documentary and International categories were \\tmade available in different sections of the platform . \\nDistributors can also pay an extra fee to add \\tvideo featurettes to promote their films on the platform . \\nThe in-person screenings were said to be \\tcancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic . \\nEligible films do not have to be added to the platform , \\tbut the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are . \\nAwards \\tceremonies . \\nTelecast \\t. \\nThe major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , commonly in late February or early \\tMarch following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees . \\nIt is the culmination of the film awards season , which \\tusually begins during November or December of the previous year . \\nThis is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red \\tcarpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day . \\nBlack tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate \\tnot wearing a bow-tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this . \\n( The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the \\tawards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast . ) \\nThe Academy Awards is the world 's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all-time \\tzones in North America and worldwide , and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world . \\nThe Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC , which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 , when ABC \\ttook over , televising the festivities ( including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 ) through 1970 . \\nNBC regained the rights for five years then ABC resumed broadcast duties \\tin 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028 . \\nThe Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international \\tmarkets ( especially those outside of the Americas ) in more desirable local timeslots . \\nThe ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 , but only \\ttwo South American countries , Chile and Brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast . \\nBy that time , the television rights to the \\tAcademy Awards had been sold in 50 countries . \\nA decade later , the rights were already being sold to 60 countries , and \\tby 1984 , the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries . \\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February , since 2004 , to help \\tdisrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry . \\nAnother reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the \\tNCAA basketball tournament , which would cut into the Academy Awards audience . \\n( In 1976 and 1977 , ABC 's regained Oscars were moved from \\tTuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC 's NCAA title game . ) \\nThe earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC , as it \\tnow usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period . \\nSome years , the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday \\tof March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games . \\nAnother reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to \\tthe religious holidays of Passover and Easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public . \\nAdvertising is somewhat restricted , however , as traditionally no movie studios \\tor competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast . \\nThe production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most Emmys in \\thistory , with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award 's own launch in 1949 . \\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific , since \\tthe 1999 ceremonies , it was moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm ET/5:30 pm PT . \\nThe reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays , that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams \\tcould be avoided , and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier . \\nFor many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast \\tbecause it would cut into the weekend box office . \\nIn 2010 , the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January \\t, citing TV viewers ' fatigue with the film industry 's long awards season . \\nHowever , such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members , to the point where some voters would only have \\ttime to view the contending films streamed on their computers ( as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail ) . \\nFurthermore , a January ceremony on Sunday would \\tclash with National Football League playoff games . \\nIn 2018 , the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from \\tlate February to mid February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 . \\nOriginally scheduled for April 8 , 1968 , the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. \\tOn March 30 , 1981 , the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington , D.C . \\nIn 1993 , an `` In Memoriam '' segment was introduced , honoring those who had made a significant contribution to \\tcinema who had died in the preceding 12 months , a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members . \\nThis segment has drawn criticism over the \\tyears for the omission of some names . \\nCriticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a `` popularity contest '' feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died \\tby the subject 's cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead . \\nThis segment was later followed \\tby a commercial break . \\nIn terms of broadcast length , the ceremony \\tgenerally averages three and a half hours . \\nThe first Oscars , in \\t1929 , lasted 15 minutes . \\nAt the other end of the spectrum , the \\t2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes . \\nIn 2010 , the organizers of the Academy Awards announced \\twinners ' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds . \\nThis , according to organizer Bill Mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what he termed `` \\tthe single most hated thing on the show '' – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion . \\nIn 2016 , in a further effort to streamline speeches \\t, winners ' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker . \\nDuring the 2018 ceremony , host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become , by announcing that he would give a brand-new jet ski to whoever \\tgave the shortest speech of the night ( a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for `` Phantom Thread '' ) . \\n`` The Wall Street Journal '' analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows : 14 on song performances ; 25 on the hosts ' speeches ; 38 on prerecorded \\tclips ; and 78 on the awards themselves , broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement , 24 on winners walking to the stage , and 30 on their acceptance speeches . \\nAlthough still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped ; the 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in \\tthe past eight years ( although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership ) , while the show itself also faced mixed reception . \\nFollowing the show , `` Variety '' reported that ABC was , in negotiating an extension to \\tits contract to broadcast the Oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself . \\nCurrently and nominally , AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice \\tof production staff and hosting , although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions . \\nIn August 2016 , AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028 : the contract \\tneither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast . \\nTV \\tratings . \\nHistorically , the telecast 's viewership is higher when box-office \\thits are favored to win the Best Picture award . \\nMore than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998 , the year of `` Titanic '' , which generated a \\tbox office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US $ 600.8 million in the US , a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years . \\nThe 76th Academy Awards ceremony , in which `` '' ( pre-telecast box office earnings of \\tUS $ 368 million ) received 11 Awards including Best Picture , drew 43.56 million viewers . \\nThe most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 42nd Academy Awards ( \\tBest Picture `` Midnight Cowboy '' ) which drew a 43.4 % household rating on April 7 , 1970 . \\nBy contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office \\ttend to show weaker ratings , despite how much critical acclaim those films have received . \\nThe 78th Academy Awards which awarded low-budget independent film `` Crash '' ( with a pre-Oscar gross of \\tUS $ 53.4 million ) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91 % . \\nIn 2008 , the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66 % household \\trating , the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time , in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards . \\nThe Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent \\tfilm ( `` No Country for Old Men '' ) . \\nWhereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6 million viewers , \\tthe 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4 million . \\nThat is the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen \\tsince it started recording audience totals in 1974 . \\nArchive \\t. \\nThe Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the 1949 Oscars and \\tmaterial on many prior ceremonies , along with ancillary material related to more recent shows . \\nCopies are held in a variety of \\tfilm , video , and digital formats . \\nVenues \\t. \\nIn 1929 , the first Academy Awards were presented \\tat a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel . \\nFrom 1930 to 1943 , the ceremony alternated between two venues : the \\tAmbassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles . \\nGrauman 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 \\t, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948 . \\nThe 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre \\tat what had been the Academy 's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood . \\nFrom 1950 to 1960 , the awards \\twere presented at Hollywood 's Pantages Theatre . \\nWith the advent of television , the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York , first at the \\tNBC International Theatre ( 1953 ) and then at the NBC Century Theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles . \\nThe Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium \\tin Santa Monica , California , in 1961 . \\nBy 1969 , the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles \\t, this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center . \\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s \\t, the ceremony returned to the Shrine . \\nIn 2002 , Hollywood 's Dolby Theatre ( previously known as \\tthe Kodak Theatre ) became the presentation 's current venue . \\nAwards of \\tMerit categories . \\nCurrent \\tcategories . \\nIn the first year of the awards , the Best Directing \\taward was split into two categories ( Drama and Comedy ) . \\nAt times , the Best Original Score award has also \\tbeen split into separate categories ( Drama and Comedy/Musical ) . \\nFrom the 1930s through the 1960s , the Art Direction ( now Production Design ) , Cinematography , \\tand Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black-and-white films and color films ) . \\nPrior to 2012 , the Production Design award was called Art \\tDirection , while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup . \\nIn August 2018 , the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live \\t, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony . \\nFollowing dissent from Academy members , they announced that \\tthey would indeed air all 24 categories live . \\nThis followed several proposals ( among them , the introduction of a Popular \\tFilm category ) that the Academy had announced but did not implement . \\nProposed \\tcategories . \\nThe Board of Governors meets each \\tyear and considers new award categories . \\nTo date , the following categories \\thave been proposed : Special categories . \\nThe Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees \\t, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole . \\nThey are not always presented \\ton an annual basis . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nAccusations of \\tcommercialism . \\nDue to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards , many studios spend millions of dollars \\tand hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the `` Oscar season '' . \\nThis has generated accusations of the Academy Awards \\tbeing influenced more by marketing than by quality . \\nWilliam Friedkin , an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in \\tNew York in 2009 , describing it as `` the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself '' . \\nTim Dirks , editor of AMC 's filmsite.org , has written of the Academy Awards : A \\trecent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign . \\nThese campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are \\tbelieved to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie . \\nExamples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against `` Zero Dark Thirty '' suggesting \\tthat it justifies torture and the claim that `` Lincoln '' distorts history . \\nAccusations of \\tbias . \\nTypical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics , biographical \\tdramas , romantic dramedies and family melodramas , most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year . \\nThe Oscars have been infamously known for selecting \\tspecific genres of movies to be awarded . \\nThe term `` Oscar bait '' \\twas coined to describe such movies . \\nThis has led , at times , to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience , e.g. , \\tby favoring `` Oscar bait '' over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues . \\nAllegations of a \\tlack of diversity . \\nThe Academy Awards have long received criticism over \\tits lack of diversity among the nominees . \\nThis criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929 , which shows us that only 6.4 % of academy award nominees \\thave been non-white and since 1991 , 11.2 % of nominees have been non-white , with the rate of winners being even more polarizing . \\nDue to a variety of reasons , including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples , a number of high-profile \\tOscars have been given to yellowface portrayals , as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters . \\nThe 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , popularized on social media with the \\thashtag # OscarsSoWhite , based on activists ' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias . \\nIn response , the Academy initiated `` \\thistoric '' changes in membership by 2020 . \\nMedia critics find the Academy 's efforts to address its \\tracial , gender , and national biases are merely distractions . \\nSome question whether the Academy 's definition of `` merit \\t'' is unjust and disempowering for BIPOC and non-Americans . \\nSymbolism or \\tsentimentalization . \\nActing prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity , to make up for a `` snub '' for a work \\tthat proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded , or presented as a `` career honor '' to recognize a distinguished nominee 's entire body of work . \\nRecognition of streaming \\tmedia film . \\nFollowing the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film `` Roma '' had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category , Steven \\tSpielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services . \\nSpielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider \\tand earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films , while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar . \\nThe United States Department of Justice , having heard of this potential rule change , wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019 , \\tcautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy . \\nFollowing its April 2019 board meeting , the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that \\tallow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical

'' \\nWhile later accepting the Best Actor award for `` King Richard '' , Smith \\tapologized to the Academy and the other nominees , but not to Rock . \\nRock decided not to \\tpress charges against Smith . \\nOn April 8 , 2022 , the Academy made an announcement on a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO \\tDawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith is banned from the Oscars for 10 years in result from the slap . \\nRefusals of \\tthe award . \\nSome winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted \\tthe ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars . \\nThe first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols ( \\tBest Writing in 1935 for `` The Informer '' ) . \\nNichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of \\tconflicts between the Academy and the Writers ' Guild . \\nNichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three \\tyears later , at the 1938 ceremony . \\nNichols was nominated for three further \\tAcademy Awards during his career . \\nGeorge C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award ( Best Actor \\tin 1970 for `` Patton '' ) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony . \\nScott described it as a `` meat parade '' , saying \\t, `` I do n't want any part of it . '' \\nThe third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando , who refused his award ( Best Actor for \\t1972 's `` The Godfather '' ) , citing the film industry 's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans . \\nAt the 45th Academy Awards ceremony , Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page \\tspeech in his place , detailing his criticisms , for which there was booing and cheering by the audience . \\nDisqualifications \\t. \\nSix films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony : One film was disqualified after winning the award , and had the winner \\treturn the Oscar : One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar : Gender segregation . \\nSome advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male \\tand female acting categories in the Academy Awards , Emmy Awards and Tony Awards . \\nThough some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men \\tto dominate unsegregated categories , other categories are unsegregated . \\nAssociated \\tevents . \\nThe following events are closely associated with the \\tannual Academy Awards : Presenter and performer gifts . \\nIt has become a tradition to give out gift \\tbags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars . \\nIn recent years , these gifts have also \\tbeen extended to award nominees and winners . \\nThe value of each of these gift bags can \\treach into the tens of thousands of dollars . \\nIn 2014 , the value was reported to \\tbe as high as US $ 80,000 . \\nThe value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue \\tService issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status . \\nOscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four-night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , spa \\ttreatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , weight-loss gummie candy and up to $ 25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich . \\nSome of the gifts have even had a `` risque '' element to them ; in 2014 , \\tthe adult products retailer Adam & amp ; Eve had a `` Secret Room Gifting Suite '' . \\nCelebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag , Carolyn Hennesy , \\tKate Linder , Chris Mulkey , Jim O'Heir , and John Salley . \\nTelevision ratings and \\tadvertisement prices . \\nFrom 2006 onwards , results are Live+SD \\t; all previous years are live viewing . \\nNotable highest wins \\tand nominees . \\nBy \\tfranchises . \\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations ( 5 or more ) : The \\tfollowing winners received multiple awards ( 2 or more ) : By people . \\nThe following nominees received multiple nominations ( 5 or more ) : The following winners received multiple awards including honorary or non-competitive ( 3 or more ) : < /doc > < doc id= '' 325 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=325 '' title= '' Action Film '' > Action Film \\t< /doc > < doc id= '' 330 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=330 '' title= '' Actrius '' > Actrius Actresses ( Catalan : Actrius ) is a 1997 Catalan language Spanish drama film produced and directed by Ventura Pons and based on the award-winning stage play `` E.R .

Aside from this , once published in Circular T , the TAI scale is not revised . \\nIn hindsight , it is possible to discover errors in TAI \\tand to make better estimates of the true proper time scale . \\nSince the published circulars are definitive , better estimates do not create another version of TAI ; \\tit is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time ( TT ) . \\nHistory \\t. \\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by \\ta single atomic clock ; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously . \\nAtomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 , using the first caesium \\tatomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory , UK ( NPL ) . \\nIt was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the Royal Greenwich \\tObservatory and to establish a time scale , called Greenwich Atomic ( GA ) . \\nThe United States Naval Observatory began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956 , using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock \\t, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards , Boulder , Colorado on 9 October 1957 . \\nThe International Time Bureau ( BIH ) began a time scale , Tm or AM , in July 1955 \\t, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals . \\nThe BIH scale , A.1 , and NBS-A were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 The procedures used by the BIH evolved \\t, and the name for the time scale changed : `` A3 '' in 1964 and `` TA ( BIH ) '' in 1969 . \\nThe SI second was defined in terms \\tof the caesium atom in 1967 . \\nFrom 1971 to 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures and the International Committee for Weights and \\tMeasures made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time ( TAI ) . \\nIn the 1970s , it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time \\tdilation , and the combined TAI scale , therefore , corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks . \\nStarting from the Julian Date 2443144.5 ( 1 January 1977 00:00:00 ) , corrections were applied to the output of \\tall participating clocks , so that TAI would correspond to proper time at the geoid ( mean sea level ) . \\nBecause the clocks were , on average , well above sea level , \\tthis meant that TAI slowed by about one part in a trillion . \\nThe former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name `` EAL '' \\t( `` Échelle Atomique Libre '' , meaning `` Free Atomic Scale '' ) . \\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time ( TCB ) , Geocentric \\tCoordinate Time ( TCG ) , and Terrestrial Time ( TT ) , which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system . \\nAll three of these time scales were defined to read JD \\t2443144.5003725 ( 1 January 1977 00:00:32.184 ) exactly at that instant . \\nTAI was henceforth a realisation of TT , with the equation TT ( TAI ) = TAI + 32.184 s. The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R \\twhich stated , `` In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds , the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI , as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC . '' \\nRelation to \\tUTC . \\nContrary to TAI , UTC \\tis a discontinuous time scale . \\nIt is occasionally adjusted \\tby leap seconds . \\nBetween these adjustments , it is composed of segments that \\tare mapped to atomic time by a constant offset . \\nFrom its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 , the adjustments were \\tmade regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated UT2 . \\nAfterward , these adjustments were made only \\tin whole seconds to approximate UT1 . \\nThis was a compromise arrangement in order \\tto enable a publicly broadcast time scale . \\nThe less frequent whole-second adjustments meant that the time scale \\twould be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally . \\nThe fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require \\ta source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 336 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=336 '' title= '' Altruism '' > Altruism Altruism is the principle \\tand moral practice of concern for the welfare and/or happiness of other human beings or animals , resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual . \\nIt is a traditional virtue in many cultures and \\ta core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews . \\nHowever , the object ( s ) \\tof concern vary among cultures and religions . \\nIn an extreme case , altruism may become a synonym \\tof selflessness , which is the opposite of selfishness . \\nThe word `` altruism '' was popularized ( and possibly coined ) by the French philosopher \\tAuguste Comte in French , as `` altruisme '' , for an antonym of egoism . \\nHe derived it from the Italian `` altrui '' , which in turn was derived from \\tLatin `` alteri '' , meaning `` other people '' or `` somebody else '' . \\nAltruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( e.g. , pleasure and quality of life \\t, time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action . \\nSteinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is `` intentional and voluntary actions that \\taim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards '' . \\nIn one sense , the opposite of altruism is spite \\t; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit . \\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of \\tloyalty or concern for the common good . \\nThe latter are predicated upon social relationships \\t, whilst altruism does not consider relationships . \\nMuch debate exists as to whether `` true \\t'' altruism is possible in human psychology . \\nThe theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described \\tas truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification . \\nThe validity of this argument depends on \\twhether qualify as `` benefits '' . \\nThe term `` altruism '' may also refer to an ethical \\tdoctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others . \\nUsed in this sense , it is usually contrasted with egoism \\t, which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first . \\nEffective altruism is the use of evidence and reason \\tto determine the most effective ways to benefit others . \\nThe notion \\tof altruism . \\nThe concept has a long history \\tin philosophical and ethical thought . \\nThe term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , Auguste Comte , \\tand has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists . \\nWhilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields , the \\tdifferent methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism . \\nIn simple terms , altruism is caring about the \\twelfare of other people and acting to help them . \\nScientific \\tviewpoints . \\nAnthropology \\t. \\nMarcel Mauss 's essay `` The Gift '' contains \\ta passage called `` Note on alms '' . \\nThis note describes the evolution of the notion of alms ( \\tand by extension of altruism ) from the notion of sacrifice . \\nIn it , he \\twrites : Evolutionary explanations . \\nIn the science of ethology ( the study of animal behaviour ) , and more generally in the study of social evolution \\t, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor . \\nIn evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity , emergency \\taid , help to coalition partners , tipping , courtship gifts , production of public goods , and environmentalism . \\nTheories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the \\tneed to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins . \\nTwo related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses \\tand from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies . \\nSome of the proposed mechanisms are : Such explanations do not imply that humans are \\talways consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts . \\nInstead , evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms , \\tsuch as emotions , that promote altruistic behaviors . \\nNot every single instance of altruistic behavior necessarily leads to an increase of inclusive fitness since , \\tif that was the case in the ancestral environment , then altruistic behaviors would have been selected . \\nThis also does not imply that on average 50 % or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment -- if the benefits from helping the \\tright person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic , even if in most cases there were no benefits . \\nThe benefits for the altruist may be increased and the \\tcosts reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups . \\nResearch has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin , to friends than to strangers , to those \\tattractive than to those unattractive , to non-competitors than to competitors , and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup . \\nThe study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R. Price 's development of \\tthe Price equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution . \\nAn interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular \\tslime moulds , such as `` Dictyostelium mucoroides '' . \\nThese protists live as individual amoebae until starved , at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting \\tbody in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body . \\nSelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds , and associated emotional , cognitive , and neurohormonal mechanisms , evolved \\tin order to facilitate long-term , high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success . \\nSuch cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter \\tKropotkin in his 1902 book `` '' and Moral Philosopher Peter Singer in his book `` A Darwinian Left '' . \\nNeurobiology \\t. \\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman , neuroscientists at the National \\tInstitutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network ( J.M . ) \\nprovided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving \\tin normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging . \\nIn their research , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006 , they showed that both pure \\tmonetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex . \\nHowever , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making \\tcharitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated : the subgenual cortex/septal region . \\nThese structures are intimately related to social \\tattachment and bonding in other species . \\nAltruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses \\tbasic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard-wired and pleasurable . \\nOne brain region , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain , contributes \\tto learning altruistic behavior , especially in those with trait empathy . \\nThe same study has shown a connection between giving \\tto charity and the promotion of social bonding . \\nIn fact , in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers , and that when confronted with moral dilemmas , these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with `` end-justifies-the-means '' answers \\t, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions , but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains . \\nAccording to Adrian Raine , a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California , one of this study 's implications \\tis that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people : `` Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse . \\nWithout that awareness , people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to \\tfind it harder to sort their way through moral thickets . \\nDoes that mean they should be held \\tto different standards of accountability ? '' \\nIn another study , in the 1990s , Dr. Bill Harbaugh , a University of Oregon economist , concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist \\tcolleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr , reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity , although they were able to divide the study group into two groups : `` egoists '' and `` altruists '' . \\nOne of their discoveries was that , though rarely , even some of the considered `` egoists '' sometimes gave more than expected because that would \\thelp others , leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity , such as a person 's environment and values . \\nPsychology \\t. \\nThe International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines `` psychological altruism '' as \\t`` a motivational state with the goal of increasing another 's welfare '' . \\nPsychological altruism is contrasted with `` psychological egoism '' , which \\trefers to the motivation to increase one 's own welfare . \\nThere has been some debate on whether or \\tnot humans are truly capable of psychological altruism . \\nSome definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and \\ta lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors . \\nHowever , because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases \\t, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question . \\nThe social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when \\tbenefits to the self outweigh costs to the self . \\nDaniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this \\tquestion and argues against the social exchange theory . \\nHe identified four major motives : to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person \\t( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism ) . \\nAltruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism , \\tbut the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless . \\nThe `` empathy-altruism hypothesis '' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and \\tis evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering . \\nFeelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress , which compel people to \\treduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need . \\nEmpathy is thus not selfless , since altruism works either as the way to avoid those negative , unpleasant feelings and have positive , pleasant feelings triggered \\tby others ' need for help , or as the way to incentive the gain of social reward or through fear to avoid social punishment by helping . \\nPeople with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided , whereas \\tthose lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another 's suffering . \\nHelping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old \\t, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues . \\nIn psychological research on altruism , studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors \\tsuch as helping , comforting , sharing , cooperation , philanthropy , and community service . \\nResearch has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a \\tperson is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person 's distress . \\nResearch also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering \\taffects the likelihood of helping ( the `` Bystander effect '' ) . \\nGreater numbers of bystanders decrease \\tindividual feelings of responsibility . \\nHowever , a witness with a high level of empathic concern is \\tlikely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders . \\nMany studies have observed the effects of volunteerism ( as a form of altruism ) on happiness and \\thealth and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being . \\nIn a study of older adults , those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction \\tand will to live , and lower in depression , anxiety , and somatization . \\nVolunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health , but physical \\thealth and longevity as well , attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages . \\nOne study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52 % of those who \\tdid not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 % of those who did volunteer experienced one . \\nA study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period , people \\twho volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 % lower likelihood of dying . \\nAfter controlling for prior health status , it was determined \\tthat volunteerism accounted for a 44 % reduction in mortality . \\nMerely being aware of kindness in oneself and \\tothers is also associated with greater well-being . \\nA study that asked participants to count each act of kindness \\tthey performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness . \\nIt is important to note that , while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness \\t, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder . \\nThe relationship between altruistic behavior \\tand happiness is bidirectional . \\nStudies have found that generosity increases linearly \\tfrom sad to happy affective states . \\nStudies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the \\tneeds of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness . \\nFor example , one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others ' demands had an even stronger \\tnegative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one ( although positive effects were still significant ) . \\nAdditionally , while generous acts make people feel good about themselves , it \\tis also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others . \\nStudies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness \\tand is also very important for our well-being . \\nA study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that `` a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in \\tnegative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals , positive affect , offering emotional support , sleep quality , and well-being '' . \\nPathological \\taltruism . \\nPathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme , and either \\tharms the altruistic person , or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good . \\nThe term `` pathological altruism '' was popularised \\tby the book `` Pathological Altruism '' . \\nExamples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals , an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one 's own \\tneeds , hoarding of animals , and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid . \\nSociology \\t. \\n`` Sociologists have long been concerned with \\thow to build the good society '' . \\nThe structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable , philanthropic , and other \\tpro-social , altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field . \\nThe American Sociology Association ( ASA ) acknowledges public sociology saying , `` The intrinsic scientific , policy , \\tand public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies ' is unquestionable '' . \\nThis type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it \\tis organized , and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies . \\nHow altruism is framed , organized , carried out , and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus \\tthat sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and `` build the good society '' . \\nThe motivation of altruism is also the focus of study ; some publications link \\tthe occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims . \\nStudies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online \\texperiments is contagious – people imitate observed generosity of others . \\nReligious \\tviewpoints . \\nMost , if not all , of the world 's \\treligions promote altruism as a very important moral value . \\nBuddhism , Christianity , Hinduism , Islam , Jainism , Judaism , \\tand Sikhism , etc. , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality . \\nBuddhism \\t. \\nAltruism figures prominently \\tin Buddhism . \\nLove and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism , and are focused on all beings equally : love is \\tthe wish that all beings be happy , and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering . \\n`` Many illnesses can be cured by \\tthe one medicine of love and compassion . \\nThese qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness , and the need for \\tthem lies at the very core of our being '' ( Dalai Lama ) . \\nStill , the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view , since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness \\t: `` The more we care for the happiness of others , the greater our own sense of well-being becomes '' ( Dalai Lama ) . \\nIn the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment , Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative ( unhappy ) consequences of our actions \\tderive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment , but from the law of karma , which functions like a natural law of cause and effect . \\nA simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes : if one causes suffering , \\tthen as a natural consequence one would experience suffering ; if one causes happiness , then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness . \\nJainism \\t. \\nThe fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism \\t, not only for humans but for all sentient beings . \\nJainism preaches the view of `` Ahimsa '' – to live \\tand let live , thereby not harming sentient beings , i.e . \\nuncompromising reverence for \\tall life . \\nIt also considers all living \\tthings to be equal . \\nThe first Tirthankara , Rishabhdev , introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings , from extending knowledge and \\texperience to others to donation , giving oneself up for others , non-violence and compassion for all living things . \\nJainism prescribes a path of non-violence to \\tprogress the soul to this ultimate goal . \\nA major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on \\tthe consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors . \\nOne 's unconquered mind with anger , pride ( ego ) , deceit \\t, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans . \\nAnger spoils good relations , pride destroys humility \\t, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything . \\nJainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness , pride by \\thumility , deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment . \\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation , one must practice the \\tfollowing ethical principles ( major vows ) in thought , speech and action . \\nThe degree to which these principles are \\tpracticed is different for householders and monks . \\nThey are : The `` great vows '' ( Mahavrata ) are prescribed for \\tmonks and `` limited vows '' ( Anuvrata ) are prescribed for householders . \\nThe house-holders are encouraged to \\tpractice the above-mentioned five vows . \\nThe monks have to \\tobserve them very strictly . \\nWith consistent practice , it will be possible to \\tovercome the limitations gradually , accelerating the spiritual progress . \\nThe principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas \\twhich limit the capabilities of the soul . \\nJainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the \\tpotential to become `` Siddha '' ( God in Jainism ) . \\nBecause all living beings possess a soul , great \\tcare and awareness is essential in one 's actions . \\nJainism emphasizes the equality of all life , advocating harmlessness \\ttowards all , whether the creatures are great or small . \\nThis policy extends even \\tto microscopic organisms . \\nJainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice \\tand therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders . \\nChristianity \\t. \\nSt Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself ' as \\tmeaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others . \\nConsidering that `` the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship '' and quotes Aristotle that `` the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves '' , \\the concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good , the good of the whole , more than any private good , the good of a part . \\nHowever , he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life—since \\tthe ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude : a more desirable thing than bodily well-being . \\nIn coining the word Altruism , as stated above , Comte was probably opposing \\tthis Thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism . \\nMany biblical authors draw a strong connection between \\tlove of others and love of God . \\n1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman \\t, and that hatred of one 's fellowman is the same as hatred of God . \\nThomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that \\taltruism is but one possible form of love . \\nAn altruistic action is not \\talways a loving action . \\nOord defines altruism as acting for the other 's good , and he agrees with feminists who note \\tthat sometimes love requires acting for one 's own good when the other 's demands undermine overall well-being . \\nGerman philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in \\twhich the strong can help the weak . \\nOne way is a sincere expression of Christian love , `` motivated by a powerful feeling of security , \\tstrength , and inner salvation , of the invincible fullness of one 's own life and existence '' . \\nAnother way is merely `` one of the many modern substitutes for love , ... nothing but \\tthe urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people 's business '' . \\nAt its worst , Scheler says , `` love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred \\t, repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etc. , directed against the opposite phenomena : wealth , strength , power , largesse . '' \\nIslam \\t. \\nIn Islam , the concept `` īthār '' ( إيثار ) ( \\taltruism ) is the notion of `` preferring others to oneself '' . \\nFor Sufis , this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one 's own concerns \\t, where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by Allah ( i.e . \\nGod ) on the human body , \\tconsidered to be property of Allah alone . \\nThe importance of `` īthār '' lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good \\t; Islam considers those practicing `` īthār '' as abiding by the highest degree of nobility . \\nThis is similar to the notion of chivalry , but unlike that European \\tconcept , in `` īthār '' attention is focused on everything in existence . \\nA constant concern for Allah results in a careful attitude towards \\tpeople , animals , and other things in this world . \\nJudaism \\t. \\nJudaism defines altruism as the \\tdesired goal of creation . \\nThe famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that \\tlove is the most important attribute in humanity . \\nThis is defined as bestowal , or giving \\t, which is the intention of altruism . \\nThis can be altruism towards humanity that leads \\tto altruism towards the creator or God . \\nKabbalah defines God as the \\tforce of giving in existence . \\nRabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation ' and how the \\twill of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force . \\nModern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag , in his writings about the \\tfuture generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework . \\nAshlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation , and everything that \\thappens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism , love for one another . \\nAshlag focused on society and \\tits relation to divinity . \\nSikhism \\t. \\nAltruism is essential to \\tthe Sikh religion . \\nThe central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe \\tand live the godly qualities like love , affection , sacrifice , patience , harmony , truthfulness . \\nThe concept of `` seva '' , or selfless service to the \\tcommunity for its own sake , is an important concept in Sikhism . \\nThe fifth Guru , Arjun Dev , sacrificed his life to uphold `` 22 carats \\tof pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity '' , the Guru Granth . \\nThe ninth Guru , Tegh Bahadur , sacrificed his \\thead to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity . \\nIn the late seventeenth century , Guru Gobind Singh ( the tenth Guru in Sikhism ) , was at war with the Mughal \\trulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh , Bhai Kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy . \\nHe gave water to both friends and \\tfoes who were wounded on the battlefield . \\nSome of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors \\twere annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy . \\nSikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh , and complained of \\this action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield . \\n`` What were you doing \\t, and why ? '' \\nasked the \\tGuru . \\n`` I was giving water to the wounded because I saw \\tyour face in all of them '' , replied Bhai Kanhaiya . \\nThe Guru responded , `` Then you should \\talso give them ointment to heal their wounds . \\nYou were practicing what you were coached \\tin the house of the Guru . '' \\nUnder the tutelage of the Guru , Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism , which \\tis still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service . \\nHinduism \\t. \\nIn Hinduism Selflessness ( Atmatyag ) , Love ( Prema ) , Kindness ( Daya ) and \\tForgiveness ( Kshama ) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or `` Manushyattva '' . \\nGiving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or `` Punya '' and Hindus believe it \\twill free their souls from guilt or `` Paapa '' and will led them to heaven or `` Swarga '' in afterlife . \\nAltruism is also the central act of various \\tHindu mythology and religious poems and songs . \\nThe founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint `` Dhnyaneshwar Maharaj '' ( 1275-1296 ) in his `` Pasaydan \\t'' pray to the supreme lord `` Vitthal '' for the wellbeing of all living organisms of the universe . \\nSwami Vivekananda , the legendary Hindu monk , has said - '' Jive prem kare jeijon , \\tSeijon sebiche Iswar '' ( Whoever loves any living being , is serving god . ) . \\nMass donation of clothes to poor people ( Vastraseva ) , or blood donation camp or \\tmass food donation ( Annaseva ) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies . \\nSwami Sivananda , an Advaita scholar , reiterates the views in his \\tcommentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras , a Vedantic text . \\nIn his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras , Sivananda notes that karma is \\tinsentient and short-lived , and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed . \\nHence , karma can not bestow the fruits of actions \\tat a future date according to one 's merit . \\nFurthermore , one can not argue that karma \\tgenerates apurva or punya , which gives fruit . \\nSince apurva is non-sentient , it can not act unless \\tmoved by an intelligent being such as a god . \\nIt can not independently \\tbestow reward or punishment . \\nHowever the very well known and popular text , the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga ( achieving oneness with God through action \\t) & amp ; `` Nishkam Karma '' or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism . \\nAltruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received \\tin Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality . \\nPhilosophy \\t. \\nThere exists a wide range of philosophical views on \\thumans ' obligations or motivations to act altruistically . \\nProponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals \\tare morally obligated to act altruistically . \\nThe opposing view is ethical egoism , which maintains that \\tmoral agents should always act in their own self-interest . \\nBoth ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism , which maintains that each agent should act in \\torder to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants . \\nA related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism , the thesis that \\thumans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible . \\nRational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one 's \\tself-interest ( without specifying how this affects one 's moral obligations ) . \\nEffective \\taltruism . \\nEffective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence \\tand reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others . \\nEffective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in \\tthe way that brings about the greatest positive impact , based upon their values . \\nIt is the broad , evidence-based and cause-neutral approach \\tthat distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity . \\nEffective altruism is part of the \\tlarger movement towards evidence-based practices . \\nWhile a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector , the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the \\tscientific projects , companies , and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives , help people , or otherwise have the biggest benefit . \\nPeople associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer , Facebook co founder Dustin Moskovitz , Cari \\tTuna , Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill and Toby Ord , and professional poker player Liv Boeree . \\nGenetics \\t. \\nThe genes OXTR , CD38 , COMT , DRD4 , DRD5 , IGF2 \\t, and GABRB2 have been found to be candidate genes for altruism . \\nDigital \\taltruism . \\nDigital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of \\treciprocity and in the belief that in the end , everyone benefits from sharing information via the Internet . \\nThis term is coined by Dr. Dana Klisanin , the founder and CEO of Evolutionary Guidance Media R & amp ; D Inc. , and \\tis a recipient of the Early Career Award for Scientific Achievement in Media Psychology from the American Psychological Association 's Division of Media Psychology . \\nAccording to Klisanin , `` the notion that some are \\twilling to freely reveal what they know '' is interesting . \\nTypes of \\tdigital altruism . \\nThere are three types of digital altruism : ( 1 ) `` everyday digital altruism , '' involving expedience , ease , moral engagement , and conformity ; ( 2 ) `` creative \\tdigital altruism , '' involving creativity , heightened moral engagement , and cooperation ; and ( 3 ) `` co-creative digital altruism '' involving creativity , moral engagement , and meta cooperative efforts . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 338 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=338 '' title= '' AutoRacing '' > AutoRacing < /doc > < doc id= '' 339 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=339 '' title= '' \\tAyn Rand '' > Ayn Rand Alice O'Connor ( born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ; , 1905 – March 6 , 1982 ) , better known by her pen name Ayn Rand ( ) , was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher . \\nShe is known for her fiction and for \\tdeveloping a philosophical system she named Objectivism . \\nBorn and educated in Russia , she \\tmoved to the United States in 1926 . \\nAfter two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays , \\tshe achieved fame with her 1943 novel , `` The Fountainhead '' . \\nIn 1957 , Rand published her best-known work \\t, the novel `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nAfterward , until her death in 1982 , she turned to non-fiction to promote \\ther philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays . \\nRand advocated reason as the only means of \\tacquiring knowledge ; she rejected faith and religion . \\nShe supported rational and ethical \\tegoism and rejected altruism . \\nIn politics , she condemned the initiation of force as \\timmoral and opposed collectivism , statism , and anarchism . \\nInstead , she supported `` laissez-faire '' capitalism , which she defined as \\tthe system based on recognizing individual rights , including private property rights . \\nAlthough Rand opposed libertarianism , which she viewed as anarchism , she \\tis often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States . \\nIn art , Rand \\tpromoted romantic realism . \\nShe was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to \\ther , except for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , and classical liberals . \\nRand 's books have sold \\tover 37 million copies . \\nHer fiction received mixed \\treviews from literary critics . \\nAlthough academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death , academic philosophers have generally \\tignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor . \\nHer writings have politically influenced \\tsome right-libertarians and conservatives . \\nThe Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , \\tboth to the public and in academic settings . \\nLife \\t. \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February 2 , 1905 \\t, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg . \\nShe was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich \\tRosenbaum , a pharmacist , and Anna Borisovna ( ) . \\nShe was twelve when the October Revolution and the rule of the \\tBolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously . \\nHer father 's business was confiscated , and the family fled to the city of Yevpatoria in \\tCrimea , which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War . \\nAfter graduating high school there in June 1921 , she returned with her family to Petrograd ( \\tas Saint Petersburg was then named ) , where they faced desperate conditions , occasionally nearly starving . \\nWhen Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution , she was \\tin the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University . \\nAt 16 , she began her studies in the \\tdepartment of social pedagogy , majoring in history . \\nAlong with many other bourgeois students , she \\twas purged from the university shortly before graduating . \\nAfter complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , \\tmany of the purged students were reinstated in the university . \\nRand was among these reinstated students and she completed her \\tstudies at the renamed Leningrad State University in October 1924 . \\nShe then studied for a year at the \\tState Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad . \\nFor an assignment , Rand wrote an essay about the Polish \\tactress Pola Negri , which became her first published work . \\nBy this time , she had decided her professional surname for writing would be `` \\tRand '' , and she adopted the first name `` Ayn '' ( pronounced ) . \\nIn late 1925 , Rand was granted \\ta visa to visit relatives in Chicago . \\nShe departed on January 17 , 1926 , and arrived \\tin New York City on February 19 , 1926 . \\nIntent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter , she lived for \\ta few months with her relatives learning English before leaving for Hollywood , California . \\nIn Hollywood , a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra \\tin his film `` The King of Kings '' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter . \\nWhile working on `` The King of Kings '' , she met an aspiring \\tyoung actor , Frank O'Connor ; the two married on April 15 , 1929 . \\nShe became a permanent American resident in July 1929 \\tand an American citizen on March 3 , 1931 . \\nShe made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the \\tUnited States , but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate . \\nEarly \\tfiction . \\nRand 's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay `` Red \\tPawn '' to Universal Studios in 1932 , although it was never produced . \\nHer courtroom drama `` Night of January 16th '' , first staged \\tin Hollywood in 1934 , reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935 . \\nEach night , a jury was selected from members of the audience ; \\tbased on its vote , one of two different endings would be performed . \\nHer first novel , the semi-autobiographical `` We \\tthe Living '' , was published in 1936 . \\nSet in Soviet Russia , it focused on \\tthe struggle between the individual and the state . \\nInitial sales were slow , and the American publisher let it \\tgo out of print , although European editions continued to sell . \\nShe adapted the story as a stage play , but the Broadway \\tproduction was a failure and closed in less than a week . \\nAfter the success of her later novels , Rand was able to release \\ta revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies . \\nRand started her next major novel , `` The Fountainhead '' , in December 1935 , \\tbut took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella `` Anthem '' . \\nThe novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such \\tan extent that even the word `` I '' has been forgotten and replaced with `` we '' . \\nIt was published in England in 1938 , but Rand \\tcould not find an American publisher at that time . \\nAs with `` We the Living '' , Rand 's later success allowed her to \\tget a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold over 3.5 million copies . \\n`` The Fountainhead '' \\tand political activism . \\nDuring the 1940s , \\tRand became politically active . \\nShe and her husband were full-time volunteers for \\tRepublican Wendell Willkie 's 1940 presidential campaign . \\nThis work brought her into contact with \\tother intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism . \\nShe became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt , who introduced \\ther to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises . \\nDespite philosophical differences with them , Rand strongly endorsed the writings of \\tboth men throughout her career , and they expressed admiration for her . \\nMises once referred to her as `` the most courageous man in America '' , a \\tcompliment that particularly pleased her because he said `` man '' instead of `` woman '' . \\nRand became friends with \\tlibertarian writer Isabel Paterson . \\nRand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings , \\tand gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book , `` The God of the Machine '' . \\nRand 's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with `` The Fountainhead '' , a novel about an uncompromising young architect named \\tHoward Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as `` second-handers '' —those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves . \\nTwelve publishers rejected it before Bobbs-Merrill Company accepted it at the insistence of editor \\tArchibald Ogden , who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it . \\nWhile completing the novel , Rand was \\tprescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue . \\nThe drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel \\t, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks ' rest . \\nHer use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed \\tto what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings . \\nThe success of `` The Fountainhead '' \\tbrought Rand fame and financial security . \\nIn 1943 , she sold the film rights to Warner \\tBros. and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay . \\nProducer Hal B. Wallis hired her \\tafterwards as a screenwriter and script-doctor . \\nHer work for him included the screenplays for `` \\tLove Letters '' and `` You Came Along '' . \\nHer contract with Wallis also allowed time for other projects , including a never-completed nonfiction \\ttreatment of her philosophy to be called `` The Moral Basis of Individualism '' . \\nWhile working in Hollywood , Rand became involved with the anti-Communist Motion Picture Alliance \\tfor the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the group 's behalf . \\nShe also joined the \\tanti-Communist American Writers Association . \\nIn 1947 , during the Second Red Scare , Rand testified as a `` friendly witness '' before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee that the \\t1944 film `` Song of Russia '' grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union , portraying life there as much better and happier than it was . \\nShe also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film `` The Best Years of Our Lives '' for what \\tshe interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but was not allowed to do so . \\nWhen asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations \\t' effectiveness , Rand described the process as `` futile '' . \\nAfter several delays , the film version of \\t`` The Fountainhead '' was released in 1949 . \\nAlthough it used Rand 's screenplay with minimal alterations , she `` disliked the movie from \\tbeginning to end '' and complained about its editing , the acting and other elements . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged \\t'' and Objectivism . \\nFollowing the publication of `` The Fountainhead '' , Rand received many \\tletters from readers , some of whom the book had influenced profoundly . \\nIn 1951 , Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City , where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the Federal \\tReserve Alan Greenspan , a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal ( later Nathaniel Branden ) and his wife Barbara , and Barbara 's cousin Leonard Peikoff . \\nInitially , the group was an informal gathering of friends who \\tmet with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy . \\nLater , Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript \\tdrafts of her new novel , `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nIn 1954 , her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into \\ta romantic affair , with the knowledge of their spouses . \\nPublished in 1957 , `` Atlas Shrugged '' \\tis considered Rand 's `` magnum opus '' . \\nShe described the novel 's theme as `` the role of the mind in man 's existence—and , \\tas a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self-interest '' . \\nIt advocates the core tenets of Rand 's philosophy \\tof Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement . \\nThe plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists , scientists , and artists respond to a \\twelfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy . \\nThe novel 's hero and leader of the strike , John Galt , describes it as stopping `` the motor \\tof the world '' by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nation 's wealth and achievements . \\nThe novel contains an exposition of Objectivism \\tin a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt . \\nDespite many negative reviews , `` Atlas Shrugged '' became an international bestseller \\t, but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' was her last completed work of fiction , marking the end of \\ther career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher . \\nIn 1958 , Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures , later incorporated as the \\tNathaniel Branden Institute ( NBI ) , to promote Rand 's philosophy through public lectures . \\nHe and Rand co-founded `` The Objectivist Newsletter '' ( later renamed `` The Objectivist '' ) in \\t1962 to circulate articles about her ideas ; she later republished some of these articles in book form . \\nRand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict \\tstandards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her . \\nCritics , including some former NBI students and Branden himself , later described the \\tculture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand . \\nSome described the NBI or the Objectivist \\tmovement as a cult or religion . \\nRand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , \\tfrom literature and music to sexuality and facial hair . \\nSome of her followers mimicked her preferences , wearing clothes to \\tmatch characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers . \\nHowever , some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated \\t, and the problem was concentrated among Rand 's closest followers in New York . \\nLater \\tyears . \\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s , Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through \\ther nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities . \\nShe began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall \\tForum , responding to questions from the audience . \\nDuring these appearances , she often took controversial stances \\ton the political and social issues of the day . \\nThese included : supporting abortion rights , opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft ( but condemning many draft dodgers as `` bums '' ) , supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as `` \\tcivilized men fighting savages '' , saying European colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians , and calling homosexuality `` immoral '' and `` disgusting '' , while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it . \\nShe endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States , most strongly Barry Goldwater \\tin 1964 , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for `` The Objectivist Newsletter '' . \\nIn 1964 , Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the \\tyoung actress Patrecia Scott , whom he later married . \\nNathaniel and Barbara Branden kept \\tthe affair hidden from Rand . \\nWhen she learned of it in 1968 , though her romantic relationship with Branden had already \\tended , Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens , and the NBI was closed . \\nShe published an article in `` The Objectivist '' repudiating Nathaniel Branden \\tfor dishonesty and other `` irrational behavior in his private life '' . \\nIn subsequent years , Rand and several \\tmore of her closest associates parted company . \\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in \\t1974 after decades of heavy smoking . \\nIn 1976 , she retired from writing her newsletter and , after her initial objections , \\tallowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare . \\nDuring the late 1970s , her activities within the Objectivist movement declined , \\tespecially after the death of her husband on November 9 , 1979 . \\nOne of her final projects was work on a \\tnever-completed television adaptation of `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nOn March 6 , 1982 , Rand died of \\theart failure at her home in New York City . \\nAt her funeral , a floral arrangement in the shape \\tof a dollar sign was placed near her casket . \\nIn her will , Rand \\tnamed Peikoff as her heir . \\nLiterary approach \\tand influences . \\nRand described her approach to literature \\tas `` romantic realism '' . \\nShe wanted her fiction to present the world `` as it could \\tbe and should be '' , rather than as it was . \\nThis approach led her to create \\thighly stylized situations and characters . \\nHer fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic \\tindividualists , depicted as fit and attractive . \\nHer villains support duty \\tand collectivist moral ideals . \\nRand often describes them as unattractive , and some have names that suggest \\tnegative traits , such as Wesley Mouch in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature , and her stories typically have \\twhat biographer Anne Heller described as `` tight , elaborate , fast-paced plotting '' . \\nRomantic triangles are a common plot element in Rand 's fiction ; in most of her novels \\tand plays , the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men . \\nInfluences \\t. \\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky , Victor Hugo , \\tEdmond Rostand , and Friedrich Schiller , who became her favorites . \\nShe considered them to be among the `` top rank '' of Romantic writers \\tbecause of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots . \\nHugo was an important influence on her \\twriting , especially her approach to plotting . \\nIn the introduction she wrote for an English-language edition of his novel `` Ninety-Three \\t'' , Rand called him `` the greatest novelist in world literature '' . \\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature , her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists \\tand other nineteenth-century Russian writing , most notably the 1863 novel `` What Is to Be Done ? '' \\nby Nikolay \\tChernyshevsky . \\nRand 's experience of the Russian Revolution and early \\tCommunist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains . \\nBeyond `` We the Living '' , which is set in Russia , this influence can be seen in the ideas and \\trhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in `` The Fountainhead '' , and in the destruction of the economy in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nRand 's descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies \\t; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios . \\nThey often follow common film editing conventions , such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene \\tfollowed by close-up details , and her descriptions of women characters often take a `` male gaze '' perspective . \\nPhilosophy \\t. \\nRand called her philosophy `` Objectivism '' , describing its essence as `` the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own \\thappiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute '' . \\nShe considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on \\tmetaphysics , epistemology , ethics , political philosophy , and aesthetics . \\nIn metaphysics , Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she \\tregarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion . \\nRand believed in free will as a \\tform of agent causation and rejected determinism . \\nIn epistemology , Rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axiomatic , \\tand reason , which she described as `` the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man 's senses '' . \\nRand rejected all claims of non-perceptual knowledge , including instinct , ' \\t'intuition , ' 'revelation , ' or any form of 'just knowing . \\nIn her `` Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology '' , Rand presented \\ta theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy . \\nShe believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy \\tof reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy . \\nIn ethics , Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism \\t( rational self-interest ) , as the guiding moral principle . \\nShe said the individual should `` exist for his own sake , \\tneither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself '' . \\nRand referred to egoism as `` the virtue of \\tselfishness '' in her book of that title . \\nIn it , she presented her solution to the is–ought problem by describing a meta-ethical \\ttheory that based morality in the needs of `` man 's survival qua man '' . \\nShe condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , and held the initiation of force \\twas evil and irrational , writing in `` Atlas Shrugged '' that , `` Force and mind are opposites '' . \\nRand 's political philosophy emphasized individual \\trights , including property rights . \\nShe considered `` laissez-faire '' capitalism the only moral social system because in \\ther view it was the only system based on protecting those rights . \\nRand opposed collectivism and statism , which she understood to include many specific forms of government \\t, such as communism , fascism , socialism , theocracy , and the welfare state . \\nHer preferred form of government was a constitutional republic \\tthat is limited to the protection of individual rights . \\nAlthough her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian \\t, Rand preferred the term `` radical for capitalism '' . \\nShe worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed \\twith them over issues such as religion and ethics . \\nRand denounced libertarianism , which \\tshe associated with anarchism . \\nShe rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in \\tsubjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice . \\nIn aesthetics , Rand defined art as a `` selective re-creation \\tof reality according to an artist 's metaphysical value-judgments '' . \\nAccording to her , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete \\tform that can be grasped easily , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness . \\nAs a writer , the art form \\tRand focused on most closely was literature . \\nShe considered romanticism to be the approach that most \\taccurately reflected the existence of human free will . \\nCriticisms \\t. \\nRand 's ethics and politics are the \\tmost criticized areas of her philosophy . \\nNumerous authors , including Robert Nozick and William F. O'Neill , in some of the earliest academic \\tcritiques of her ideas , said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem . \\nCritics have called her definitions of `` egoism '' and \\t`` altruism '' biased and inconsistent with normal usage . \\nCritics from religious traditions oppose her \\tatheism and her rejection of altruism . \\nMultiple critics , including Nozick , have said her \\tattempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails . \\nOthers , like libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer , have gone further , saying that \\ther support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions . \\nSome critics , like Roy Childs , have said that her opposition to the \\tinitiation of force should lead to support of anarchism , rather than limited government . \\nCommentators , including Hazel Barnes , Albert Ellis , and Nathaniel Branden \\t, have criticized Rand 's focus on the importance of reason . \\nBranden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create \\tunrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be . \\nRelationship to \\tother philosophers . \\nExcept for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals , Rand was \\tsharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her . \\nAcknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence , Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she \\tcould only recommend `` three A 's '' —Aristotle , Aquinas , and Ayn Rand . \\nIn a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace , when asked where her philosophy came from , she responded : `` Out of \\tmy own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle , the only philosopher who ever influenced me . '' \\nIn an article for the `` Claremont Review of Books '' , political scientist Charles \\tMurray criticized her claim that her only `` philosophical debt '' was to Aristotle . \\nHe asserted her ideas were derivative of previous \\tthinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche . \\nRand found early inspiration from Nietzsche , and scholars have \\tfound indications of this in Rand 's private journals . \\nIn 1928 , she alluded to his idea of the `` superman '' in notes \\tfor an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman . \\nThere are other indications of Nietzsche 's influence in passages from the first edition of `` We \\tthe Living '' ( which Rand later revised ) , and in her overall writing style . \\nBy the time she wrote `` The Fountainhead '' , Rand had turned against Nietzsche 's ideas \\t, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed . \\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant , whom she referred to as `` the most evil \\tman in mankind 's history '' ; she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self-interest . \\nPhilosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued \\tshe misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences . \\nShe was also critical of Plato , and viewed his differences with Aristotle on \\tquestions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy . \\nRand 's relationship with contemporary \\tphilosophers was mostly antagonistic . \\nShe was not an academic and \\tdid not participate in academic discourse . \\nShe was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she \\tdisagreed with in a polemical manner without in-depth analysis . \\nShe was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers , who \\tdismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration . \\nReception and \\tlegacy . \\nCritical \\treception . \\nThe first reviews Rand received were for \\t`` Night of January 16th '' . \\nReviews of the Broadway production were largely positive , but Rand considered even positive reviews \\tto be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer . \\nAlthough Rand believed that her novel `` We the Living '' was \\tnot widely reviewed , over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews . \\nOverall , they were more positive than \\tthose she received for her later work . \\nHer novella `` Anthem '' received little review attention , both \\tfor its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues . \\nRand 's first bestseller , `` The Fountainhead '' , received far fewer reviews \\tthan `` We the Living '' , and reviewers ' opinions were mixed . \\nLorine Pruette 's positive review in `` The New York Times '' , which called the author `` a writer \\tof great power '' who wrote `` brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly '' , was one that Rand greatly appreciated . \\nThere were other positive reviews , but Rand dismissed most of them \\tfor either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications . \\nSome negative reviews said the novel was too long ; others called \\tthe characters unsympathetic and Rand 's style `` offensively pedestrian '' . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' was widely reviewed , \\tand many of the reviews were strongly negative . \\n`` Atlas Shrugged '' received positive reviews from a few publications , but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that `` reviewers seemed to vie with each other in \\ta contest to devise the cleverest put-downs '' , with reviews including comments that it was `` written out of hate '' and showed `` remorseless hectoring and prolixity '' . \\nWhittaker Chambers wrote what was later called the novel 's most `` \\tnotorious '' review for the conservative magazine `` National Review '' . \\nHe accused Rand of supporting a godless system ( which he related to that of the Soviets ) , claiming , `` From \\talmost any page of `` Atlas Shrugged '' , a voice can be heard ... commanding : 'To a gas chamber—go ! . \\nRand 's nonfiction received far \\tfewer reviews than her novels . \\nThe tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book , `` For the \\tNew Intellectual '' , was similar to that for `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nPhilosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to `` the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union \\t'' , and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint `` nearly perfect in its immorality '' . \\nThese reviews set the pattern for reaction \\tto her ideas among liberal critics . \\nHer subsequent books got \\tprogressively less review attention . \\nPopular \\tinterest . \\nWith over 37 million copies sold , Rand \\t's books continue to be read widely . \\nA survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club in \\t1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives . \\nRand 's `` Atlas Shrugged '' was the \\tsecond most popular choice , after the Bible . \\nAlthough Rand 's influence has been greatest in the United \\tStates , there has been international interest in her work . \\nRand 's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , like Ira Levin , Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith \\t; she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer , Terry Goodkind , and comic book artist Steve Ditko . \\nRand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many \\tbusiness executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work . \\nBusinessmen such as John Allison of BB & amp ; T and Ed \\tSnider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand 's ideas . \\nTelevision shows , movies , and video games \\thave referred to Rand and her works . \\nThroughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines , as well as \\tbook-length critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W. Robbins . \\nRand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors , \\tincluding Mary Gaitskill , Matt Ruff , Kay Nolte Smith , and Tobias Wolff . \\nNick Gillespie , former editor-in-chief of `` Reason '' , remarked that , `` Rand 's is a \\ttortured immortality , one in which she 's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist . \\nJibes at Rand as cold and inhuman \\trun through the popular culture . '' \\nTwo movies have been made \\tabout Rand 's life . \\nA 1997 documentary film , `` '' , was \\tnominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . \\n`` The Passion of Ayn Rand '' , a 1999 television adaptation \\tof the book of the same name , won several awards . \\nRand 's image also appears on a 1999 \\tU.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano . \\nRand 's works , most commonly `` Anthem '' or `` \\tThe Fountainhead '' , are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading . \\nSince 2002 , the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rand \\t's novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum . \\nThe Institute had distributed 4.5 million copies in the \\tU.S. and Canada by the end of 2020 . \\nIn 2017 , Rand was added to the required reading list \\tfor the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom . \\nPolitical \\tinfluence . \\nAlthough she rejected the labels `` conservative '' and `` libertarian '' \\t, Rand has had a continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism . \\nRand is often considered one of the three most important women ( along with Rose \\tWilder Lane and Isabel Paterson ) in the early development of modern American libertarianism . \\nDavid Nolan , one founder of the Libertarian Party , said that \\t`` without Ayn Rand , the libertarian movement would not exist '' . \\nIn his history of that movement , journalist Brian Doherty described her as `` \\tthe most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large '' . \\nPolitical scientist Andrew Koppelman called her `` \\tthe most widely read libertarian '' . \\nHistorian Jennifer Burns referred to her as `` the \\tultimate gateway drug to life on the right '' . \\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the Republican Party \\t) , despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative , like being pro-choice and an atheist . \\nShe faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley Jr. and other contributors to the conservative \\t`` National Review '' magazine , which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas . \\nNevertheless , a 1987 article in `` The New York Times '' \\treferred to her as the Reagan administration 's `` novelist laureate '' . \\nRepublican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence \\ton their lives and have recommended her novels . \\nShe has influenced some conservative politicians outside the U.S. , such as Sajid Javid in \\tthe United Kingdom , Siv Jensen in Norway , and Ayelet Shaked in Israel . \\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially \\t`` Atlas Shrugged '' , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis . \\nOpinion articles compared real-world events \\twith the novel 's plot . \\nSigns mentioning Rand and her fictional hero \\tJohn Galt appeared at Tea Party protests . \\nThere was increased criticism of her ideas \\t, especially from the political left . \\nCritics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and \\tfree markets , particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan . \\nIn 2015 , Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan , `` Rand had effectively \\tchucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy '' . \\nLisa Duggan said that Rand 's novels had `` incalculable \\timpact '' in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas . \\nIn 2021 , Cass Sunstein said Rand 's ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies \\tof the Trump administration , which he attributed to the `` enduring influence '' of Rand 's fiction . \\nAcademic \\treaction . \\nDuring Rand 's lifetime , her work \\treceived little attention from academic scholars . \\nSince her death , interest in \\ther work has increased gradually . \\nIn 2009 , historian Jennifer Burns identified `` three overlapping waves '' of scholarly \\tinterest in Rand , including `` an explosion of scholarship '' since 2000 . \\nAs of that year , few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with \\tmany literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study . \\nFrom 2002 to 2012 , over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BB & amp ; T Corporation that required teaching \\tRand 's ideas or works ; in some cases , the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about Rand . \\nIn 2020 , media critic Eric Burns said that , `` Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime '' \\t, but `` nobody in the academe pays any attention to her , neither as an author nor a philosopher '' . \\nThat same year , the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held `` \\ta stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule '' her work , but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years . \\nTo her \\tideas . \\nIn 1967 , John Hospers discussed Rand 's ethical ideas in the second \\tedition of his textbook , `` An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis '' . \\nThat same year , Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing \\tObjectivism in her book `` An Existentialist Ethics '' . \\nWhen the first full-length academic book about Rand 's philosophy appeared in 1971 , its author declared writing about \\tRand `` a treacherous undertaking '' that could lead to `` guilt by association '' for taking her seriously . \\nA few articles about Rand 's ideas appeared in academic journals before her \\tdeath in 1982 , many of them in `` The Personalist '' . \\nOne of these was `` On the Randian Argument '' by \\tlibertarian philosopher Robert Nozick , who criticized her meta-ethical arguments . \\nOther philosophers , writing in the same publication \\t, argued that Nozick misstated Rand 's case . \\nIn an article responding to Nozick , Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen defended \\ther positions , but described her style as `` literary , hyperbolic and emotional '' . \\n`` The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand '' , a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by \\tDen Uyl and Rasmussen , was the first academic book about Rand 's ideas published after her death . \\nIn one essay , political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite `` the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage '' , Rand \\t's ethics are `` a most immense achievement , the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought '' . \\nIn 1987 , the Ayn Rand Society was founded \\tas an affiliate of the American Philosophical Association . \\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in `` Contemporary Women Philosophers '' , \\tJenny A. Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand . \\nShe said that Rand 's philosophy `` \\tis regularly omitted from academic philosophy . \\nYet , throughout literary academia , Ayn \\tRand is considered a philosopher . '' \\nWriting in the 1998 edition of the `` Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy '' , political \\ttheorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts . \\nHe said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle 's ethics , and her political theory `` is of little interest \\t'' because it is marred by an `` ill-thought out and unsystematic '' effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism . \\n`` The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies '' , a multidisciplinary , peer-reviewed academic journal \\tdevoted to the study of Rand and her ideas , was established in 1999 . \\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute , Huemer argued very \\tfew people find Rand 's ideas convincing , especially her ethics . \\nHe attributed the attention she receives to her being a `` compelling writer '' , especially as a novelist , \\tnoting that `` Atlas Shrugged '' outsells Rand 's non-fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism . \\nIn 2012 , the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of `` The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies '' , \\tand the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an `` Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies '' series based on the Society 's proceedings . \\nThe Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the `` Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\t'' said that `` only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously '' . \\nThat same year , political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a `` nonperson '' among academics , \\tan attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as `` the traditional academic view '' of Rand . \\nPhilosopher Skye C. Cleary wrote in a 2018 article for `` \\tAeon '' that , `` Philosophers love to hate Ayn Rand . \\nIt 's trendy to scoff at \\tany mention of her . '' \\nHowever , Cleary said that because many people take Rand 's ideas seriously , philosophers `` \\tneed to treat the Ayn Rand phenomenon seriously '' and provide refutations rather than ignoring her . \\nTo her \\tfiction . \\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life \\twas even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy . \\nMimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rand 's novels when she began researching \\ther in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s . \\nSince her death , scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore \\ther work , although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s . \\nSeveral academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her \\tworks , as do popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes . \\nIn `` The Literary Encyclopedia '' entry for Rand written in 2001 , John David \\tLewis declared that `` Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation . '' \\nIn 2019 , Duggan described Rand 's fiction as popular and influential on many readers , despite being easy to criticize for `` \\ther cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots , her rigid moralizing , her middle- to lowbrow aesthetic preferences ... and philosophical strivings '' . \\nObjectivist \\tmovement . \\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute \\t, the Objectivist movement continued in other forms . \\nIn the 1970s , Peikoff \\tbegan delivering courses on Objectivism . \\nIn 1979 , Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called \\t`` The Intellectual Activist '' , which Rand endorsed . \\nShe also endorsed `` The Objectivist Forum '' , a bimonthly magazine founded \\tby Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger , which ran from 1980 to 1987 . \\nIn 1985 , Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand \\tInstitute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand 's ideas and works . \\nIn 1990 , after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff , David Kelley founded \\tthe Institute for Objectivist Studies , now known as The Atlas Society . \\nIn 2001 , historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist \\tScholarship , which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia . \\nSelected \\tworks . \\nFiction and drama : Non-fiction : < /doc > < doc id= '' 340 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ?

curid=344 '' title= '' Allan Dwan '' > Allan Dwan Allan Dwan ( \\tborn Joseph Aloysius Dwan ; April 3 , 1885 – December 28 , 1981 ) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director , producer , and screenwriter . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nBorn Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , Dwan , was the younger son of commercial \\ttraveler of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan ( 1857–1917 ) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan , née Hunt . \\nThe family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4 , \\t1892 , by ferry from Windsor to Detroit , according to his naturalization petition of August 1939 . \\nHis elder brother , Leo Garnet Dwan \\t( 1883–1964 ) , became a physician . \\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame \\tand then worked for a lighting company in Chicago . \\nHe had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry , and when Essanay \\tStudios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter , he took the job . \\nAt that time , some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend \\twinters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather . \\nSoon , a number of movie companies worked there year-round , \\tand in 1911 , Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood . \\nWhile still in New York , in 1917 he was the founding \\tpresident of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association . \\nCareer \\t. \\nDwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa , \\tCalifornia , from August 1911 to July 1912 . \\nFlying A was one of the first \\tmotion pictures studios in California history . \\nOn August 12 , 2011 , a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue \\tand La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa , California . \\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies , Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful \\tmovies as well as her husband , Douglas Fairbanks , notably in the acclaimed 1922 `` Robin Hood '' . \\nDwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films , and \\tone short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm . \\nThis short , also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise , was produced as a joke , for the April \\t26 , 1925 `` Lambs ' Gambol '' for The Lambs , with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club . \\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies , Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in `` Heidi \\t'' ( 1937 ) and `` Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm '' ( 1938 ) . \\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors , Victor Fleming , who went on to direct `` The Wizard of \\tOz '' and `` Gone With the Wind '' , and Marshall Neilan , who became an actor , director , writer and producer . \\nOver a long career spanning almost 50 years , Dwan directed 125 motion pictures , some of which \\twere highly acclaimed , such as the 1949 box office hit , `` Sands of Iwo Jima '' . \\nHe directed his last \\tmovie in 1961 . \\nHe died in Los Angeles at the age of 96 , and is \\tinterred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery , Mission Hills , California . \\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood \\tWalk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard . \\nDaniel Eagan of `` Film Journal International '' described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema , stating that his \\tstyle `` is so basic as to seem invisible , but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion .

the east by Libya ; to the southeast by Niger ; to the southwest \\tby Mali , Mauritania , and Western Sahara ; to the west by Morocco ; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea . \\nIt is considered part of the \\tMaghreb region of North Africa . \\nIt has a semi-arid geography , with most of the population living in \\tthe fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south . \\nAlgeria covers an area of , making it the world 's tenth largest nation by area , and the largest nation \\tin Africa , being more than 200 times as large as the smallest country in the continent , The Gambia . \\nWith a population of 44 million , Algeria is the ninth-most populous \\tcountry in Africa , and the 32nd-most populous country in the world . \\nThe capital and largest city is Algiers , located \\tin the far north on the Mediterranean coast . \\nAlgeria produced and is linked to many civilizations , empires and dynasties , including ancient Numidians , Phoenicians , Carthaginians , Romans , Vandals , Byzantines , Umayyads , Abbasids , Rustamids , \\tIdrisids , Aghlabids , Fatimids , Zirids , Hammadids , Almoravids , Almohads , Zayyanids , Spaniards , Ottomans and the French colonial empire , with the latter expanded into its present-boundaries . \\nAfter 132 years of being part of France , tensions between France and the local Algerian populace led to the start of the Algerian War which \\tconcluded with Algeria obtaining its independence on 5 July 1962 with the establishment of the People 's Democratic Republic on 20 September of that year . \\nThe official languages of Algeria \\tare Arabic and Berber . \\nThe majority of Algeria 's population \\tis Arab , practicing Islam . \\nThe native Algerian Arabic is \\tthe main spoken language . \\nFrench also serves as an administrative and educational language in \\tsome contexts , but it has no official status . \\nAlgeria is a semi-presidential republic , with local \\tconstituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes . \\nAlgeria is a regional power in North Africa \\t, and a middle power in global affairs . \\nIt has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one \\tof the largest economies on the continent , based largely on energy exports . \\nAlgeria has the world 's sixteenth-largest oil reserves \\tand the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas . \\nSonatrach , the national oil company , is the largest company \\tin Africa , supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe . \\nAlgeria 's military is one of the largest in Africa \\t, and has the largest defence budget on the continent . \\nIt is a member of the African Union , the Arab League , the OIC , OPEC , \\tthe United Nations , and the Arab Maghreb Union , of which it is a founding member . \\nName \\t. \\nOther forms of the name are \\t: , ; ; ; ; . \\nIt is officially the People 's Democratic Republic of Algeria \\t( ; , , ; , abbreviated as RADP ) . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe country 's name derives from the city of Algiers which in turn derives from the Arabic ( , `` The Islands '' ) , \\ta truncated form of the older ( , `` Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe '' ) , employed by medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPrehistory and \\tancient history . \\nAround ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech ( Algeria ) were \\tconsidered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa . \\nStone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be \\t~1.9 million years old , and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4 million years . \\nHence , the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited \\tthe Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought . \\nThe evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa \\t, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa . \\nNeanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian \\tstyles ( 43,000 BC ) similar to those in the Levant . \\nAlgeria was the site of the highest state \\tof development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques . \\nTools of this era , starting about 30,000 BC , are called Aterian ( \\tafter the archaeological site of Bir el Ater , south of Tebessa ) . \\nThe earliest blade industries in North Africa are called \\tIberomaurusian ( located mainly in the Oran region ) . \\nThis industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal \\tregions of the Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC . \\nNeolithic civilization ( animal domestication and agriculture ) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb \\tperhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC . \\nThis life , richly depicted in the Tassili n'Ajjer \\tpaintings , predominated in Algeria until the classical period . \\nThe mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that \\tcame to be called Berbers , who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa . \\nFrom their principal center of power at Carthage , the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast ; by 600 BC \\t, a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa , east of Cherchell , Hippo Regius ( modern Annaba ) and Rusicade ( modern Skikda ) . \\nThese settlements served as market \\ttowns as well as anchorages . \\nAs Carthaginian power grew , its impact \\ton the indigenous population increased dramatically . \\nBerber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture , \\tmanufacturing , trade , and political organisation supported several states . \\nTrade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew , but territorial expansion also resulted \\tin the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others . \\nBy the early 4th century BC , Berbers formed \\tthe single largest element of the Carthaginian army . \\nIn the Revolt of the Mercenaries , Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 \\tBC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War . \\nThey succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage 's North African territory , and they \\tminted coins bearing the name Libyan , used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa . \\nThe Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats \\tby the Romans in the Punic Wars . \\nIn 146 BC the city \\tof Carthage was destroyed . \\nAs Carthaginian power waned , the influence \\tof Berber leaders in the hinterland grew . \\nBy the 2nd century BC , several large \\tbut loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged . \\nTwo of them were established in Numidia , \\tbehind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage . \\nWest of Numidia lay Mauretania , which extended across the \\tMoulouya River in modern-day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean . \\nThe high point of Berber civilisation , unequalled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more \\tthan a millennium later , was reached during the reign of Masinissa in the 2nd century BC . \\nAfter Masinissa 's death in 148 BC , the \\tBerber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times . \\nMasinissa 's line survived until 24 AD , when the \\tremaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire . \\nFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans \\t, who founded many colonies in the region . \\nLike the rest of North Africa , Algeria was one of the \\tbreadbaskets of the empire , exporting cereals and other agricultural products . \\nSaint Augustine was the bishop of Hippo Regius ( modern-day Annaba \\t, Algeria ) , located in the Roman province of Africa . \\nThe Germanic Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa \\tin 429 , and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia . \\nThey did not make any significant settlement on the \\tland , as they were harassed by local tribes . \\nIn fact , by the time the Byzantines arrived Leptis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was \\toccupied by the indigenous Laguatan who had been busy facilitating an Amazigh political , military and cultural revival . \\nFurthermore , during the rule of the Romans , Byzantines , Vandals , Carthaginians , and Ottomans \\tthe Berber people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent . \\nThe Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest \\tof North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains . \\nThe collapse of the Western Roman Empire led to the establishment of a native \\tKingdom based in Altava ( modern day Algeria ) known as the Mauro-Roman Kingdom . \\nIt was succeeded by another Kingdom based \\tin Altava , the Kingdom of Altava . \\nDuring the reign of Kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern-day Fez in the \\twest to the western Aurès and later Kairaouan and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east . \\nMiddle \\tAges . \\nAfter negligible resistance from the locals , Muslim Arabs of \\tthe Umayyad Caliphate conquered Algeria in the early 8th century . \\nLarge numbers of the indigenous \\tBerber people converted to Islam . \\nChristians , Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end \\tof the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th . \\nAfter the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate , numerous local dynasties emerged , including the Rustamids \\t, Aghlabids , Fatimids , Zirids , Hammadids , Almoravids , Almohads and the Zayyanids . \\nThe Christians left in three waves : after the initial \\tconquest , in the 10th century and the 11th . \\nThe last were evacuated to Sicily by the Normans and \\tthe few remaining died out in the 14th century . \\nDuring the Middle Ages , North Africa was home to many great scholars , saints and sovereigns including Judah Ibn Quraysh , the first grammarian to mention Semitic \\tand Berber languages , the great Sufi masters Sidi Boumediene ( Abu Madyan ) and Sidi El Houari , and the Emirs Abd Al Mu'min and Yāghmūrasen . \\nIt was during this time that the Fatimids or children of \\tFatima , daughter of Muhammad , came to the Maghreb . \\nThese `` Fatimids '' went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb , Hejaz and the Levant , boasting a secular inner government \\t, as well as a powerful army and navy , made up primarily of Arabs and Levantines extending from Algeria to their capital state of Cairo . \\nThe Fatimid Caliphate began to collapse \\twhen its governors the Zirids seceded . \\nIn order to punish them the Fatimids sent the \\tArab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym against them . \\nThe resultant war is recounted \\tin the epic Tāghribāt . \\nIn Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero Khālīfā Al-Zānatī asks daily , for duels , to defeat \\tthe Hilalan hero Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī and many other Arab knights in a string of victories . \\nThe Zirids , however , were ultimately defeated ushering \\tin an adoption of Arab customs and culture . \\nThe indigenous Amazigh tribes , however , remained largely independent , and depending on tribe , location and \\ttime controlled varying parts of the Maghreb , at times unifying it ( as under the Fatimids ) . \\nThe Fatimid Islamic state , also known as Fatimid Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa , Sicily , Palestine \\t, Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , Egypt , the Red Sea coast of Africa , Tihamah , Hejaz and Yemen . \\nCaliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time , as well as forming \\tpart of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era . \\nThe Berber people historically \\tconsisted of several tribes . \\nThe two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes , \\twho were divided into tribes , and again into sub-tribes . \\nEach region of the Maghreb contained several tribes ( for example , Sanhadja , \\tHouara , Zenata , Masmouda , Kutama , Awarba , and Berghwata ) . \\nAll these tribes made \\tindependent territorial decisions . \\nSeveral Amazigh dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages \\tin the Maghreb and other nearby lands . \\nIbn Khaldun provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region , the Zirid , Ifranid , \\tMaghrawa , Almoravid , Hammadid , Almohad , Merinid , Abdalwadid , Wattasid , Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties . \\nBoth of the Hammadid and Zirid empires as well as the \\tFatimids established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries . \\nThe Zirids ruled land in what is now Algeria , Tunisia \\t, Morocco , Libya , Spain , Malta and Italy . \\nThe Hammadids captured and held important regions such as Ouargla , Constantine , Sfax , Susa \\t, Algiers , Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region . \\nThe Fatimids which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all \\tof North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East . \\nFollowing the Berber revolt numerous independent \\tstates emerged across the Maghreb . \\nIn Algeria the Rustamid \\tKingdom was established . \\nThe Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south , central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all \\tof the modern day Maghreb countries , in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of Mali and included territory in Mauritania . \\nOnce extending their control over all of the Maghreb , part of Spain and briefly over Sicily \\t, originating from modern Algeria , the Zirids only controlled modern Ifriqiya by the 11th century . \\nThe Zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of \\tthe Fatimid caliphs of Cairo . \\nEl Mu'izz the Zirid ruler decided to \\tend this recognition and declared his independence . \\nThe Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms , for example the Maghrawa , a Berber dynasty originating from Algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling \\tover much of Morocco and western Algeria including Fez , Sijilmasa , Aghmat , Oujda , most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in Algeria . \\nAs the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to \\tattempt a direct invasion , they found another means of revenge . \\nBetween the Nile and the Red Sea were living Bedouin \\tnomad tribes expelled from Arabia for their disruption and turbulency . \\nThe Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym for example , who regularly disrupted \\tfarmers in the Nile Valley since the nomads would often loot their farms . \\nThe then Fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he could n't control \\t, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Beduouin tribes . \\nThe Fatimids even gave \\tthem money to leave . \\nWhole tribes set off with women , children \\t, elders , animals and camping equipment . \\nSome stopped on the way , especially in Cyrenaica , where they are still one of the \\tessential elements of the settlement but most arrived in Ifriqiya by the Gabes region , arriving 1051 . \\nThe Zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide , but with each encounter , the last under \\tthe walls of Kairouan , his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield . \\nThe Arabs usually did n't take control over the \\tcities , instead looting them and destroying them . \\nThe invasion kept going , and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of Constantine where they encircled the Qalaa \\tof Banu Hammad ( capital of the Hammadid Emirate ) , as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago . \\nFrom there they gradually gained the \\tupper Algiers and Oran plains . \\nSome of these territories were forcibly taken back by the \\tAlmohads in the second half of the 12th century . \\nThe influx of Bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic , cultural Arabization of \\tthe Maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant . \\nIbn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by \\tBanu Hilal tribes had become completely arid desert . \\nThe Almohads originating from modern day Morocco , although founded by a man originating \\tfrom Algeria known as Abd al-Mu'min would soon take control over the Maghreb . \\nDuring the time of the Almohad Dynasty Abd al-Mu'min 's tribe , the Koumïa , \\twere the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire . \\nDefeating the weakening Almoravid Empire and taking control over Morocco in 1147 , they pushed into Algeria in 1152 , taking control over Tlemcen , \\tOran , and Algiers , wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs , and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern Algeria . \\nFollowing their decisive defeat in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 the Almohads began collapsing , and in 1235 the \\tgovernor of modern-day Western Algeria , Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan declared his independence and established the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Zayyanid dynasty . \\nWarring with the Almohad forces attempting to restore control over Algeria for 13 years , they \\tdefeated the Almohads in 1248 after killing their Caliph in a successful ambush near Oujda . \\nThe Zayyanids retained their control \\tover Algeria for 3 centuries . \\nMuch of the eastern territories of Algeria were under the authority of the Hafsid dynasty , although the \\tEmirate of Bejaia encompassing the Algerian territories of the Hafsids would occasionally be independent from central Tunisian control . \\nAt their peak the Zayyanid kingdom included all of Morocco as its vassal to the west and \\tin the east reached as far as Tunis which they captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin . \\nAfter several conflicts with local Barbary pirates sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans , \\tSpain decided to invade Algeria and defeat the native Kingdom of Tlemcen . \\nIn 1505 , they invaded and captured Mers el Kébir , \\tand in 1509 after a bloody siege , they conquered Oran . \\nFollowing their decisive victories over the Algerians in the western-coastal areas of Algeria \\t, the Spanish decided to get bolder , and invaded more Algerian cities . \\nIn 1510 , they led a series of sieges and attacks , taking over \\tBejaia in a large siege , and leading a semi-successful siege against Algiers . \\nThey also \\tbesieged Tlemcen . \\nIn 1511 , they took control over Cherchell and Jijel , and attacked Mostaganem where although they \\twere n't able to conquer the city , they were able to force a tribute on them . \\nOttoman \\tera . \\nIn 1516 , the Ottoman privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa , who \\toperated successfully under the Hafsids , moved their base of operations to Algiers . \\nThey succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the Spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the \\tChristians , but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions . \\nWhen Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of \\tTlemcen , Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers . \\nThe Ottoman sultan gave him the title of \\tbeylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 janissaries . \\nWith the aid of this force and native Algerians , Hayreddin conquered the whole area between \\tConstantine and Oran ( although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792 ) . \\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin 's son Hasan \\t, who assumed the position in 1544 . \\nHe was a Kouloughli or of mixed origins \\t, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse . \\nUntil 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by \\tBeylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits . \\nSubsequently , with the institution of a regular administration , \\tgovernors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms . \\nThe pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit , known \\tin Algeria as the Ojaq who were led by an agha . \\nDiscontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were \\tnot paid regularly , and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha . \\nAs a result , the agha charged the pasha \\twith corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 . \\nPlague had repeatedly struck the \\tcities of North Africa . \\nAlgiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21 , \\tand had high fatalities in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 and 1740–42 . \\nThe Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other \\tnon-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea . \\nThe pirates often took the passengers and crew on the \\tships and sold them or used them as slaves . \\nThey also did a brisk business \\tin ransoming some of the captives . \\nAccording to Robert Davis , from the 16th to 19th century \\t, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves . \\nThey often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell \\tat slave markets in North Africa and other parts of the Ottoman Empire . \\nIn 1544 , for example , Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the island of Ischia , taking \\t4,000 prisoners , and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari , almost the entire population . \\nIn 1551 , the Ottoman governor of Algiers , Turgut Reis \\t, enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo . \\nBarbary pirates often attacked \\tthe Balearic Islands . \\nThe threat was so severe that \\tresidents abandoned the island of Formentera . \\nThe introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the \\t17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic . \\nIn July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of Dutch \\tpirate Jan Janszoon sailed as far as Iceland , raiding and capturing slaves . \\nTwo weeks earlier another pirate ship from Salé \\tin Morocco had also raided in Iceland . \\nSome of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back \\tto Iceland , but some chose to stay in Algeria . \\nIn 1629 , pirate ships from \\tAlgeria raided the Faroe Islands . \\nIn 1671 , the taifa of raises , or the company of corsair captains \\trebelled , killed the agha , and placed one of its own in power . \\nThe new leader received \\tthe title of Dey . \\nAfter 1689 , the right to select the dey passed \\tto the divan , a council of some sixty nobles . \\nIt was at first dominated by the `` ojaq '' ; but \\tby the 18th century , it had become the dey 's instrument . \\nIn 1710 , the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and \\this successors as regent , replacing the pasha in that role . \\nAlthough Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire , in reality they acted independently from the rest of \\tthe Empire , and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the Beylik of Tunis . \\nThe dey was in \\teffect a constitutional autocrat . \\nThe dey was elected for a life term , but in the 159 years ( 1671–1830 \\t) that the system was in place , fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated . \\nDespite usurpation , military coups and occasional mob rule , \\tthe day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly . \\nAlthough the regency patronised the tribal chieftains , it never had the \\tunanimous allegiance of the countryside , where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest . \\nAutonomous tribal states were tolerated , and the regency 's authority was seldom applied in the Kabylia , \\talthough in 1730 the Regency was able to take control over the Kingdom of Kuku in western Kabylia . \\nMany cities in the northern parts of the Algerian desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys , although \\tthey otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control , while the deeper parts of the Sahara were completely independent from Algiers . \\nBarbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping , and \\tas a result , the Spanish Navy bombarded Algiers in 1783 and 1784 . \\nFor the attack in 1784 , the Spanish fleet was to be joined by ships \\tfrom such traditional enemies of Algiers as Naples , Portugal and the Knights of Malta . \\nOver 20,000 cannonballs were fired , much of the city and its \\tfortifications were destroyed and most of the Algerian fleet was sunk . \\nIn 1792 , Algiers took back Oran and Mers el \\tKébir , the two last Spanish strongholds in Algeria . \\nIn the same year , they conquered the Moroccan Rif \\tand Oujda , which they then abandoned in 1795 . \\nIn the 19th century , Algerian pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers , paying \\ta `` license tax '' in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels . \\nAttacks by Algerian pirates on American merchantmen resulted in the First and Second \\tBarbary Wars , which ended the attacks on U.S. ships in 1815 . \\nA year later , a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet , under the command \\tof Lord Exmouth bombarded Algiers to stop similar attacks on European fishermen . \\nThese efforts proved successful , although Algerian piracy \\twould continue until the French conquest in 1830 . \\nFrench colonization ( \\t1830–1962 ) . \\nUnder the pretext of a slight to their consul \\t, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830 . \\nHistorian Ben Kiernan wrote on the French conquest of Algeria \\t: `` By 1875 , the French conquest was complete . \\nThe war had killed approximately 825,000 \\tindigenous Algerians since 1830 . '' \\nFrench losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead \\tin the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action . \\nThe population of Algeria , which stood at about 2.9 \\tmillion in 1872 , reached nearly 11 million in 1960 . \\nFrench policy was predicated on \\t`` civilising '' the country . \\nThe slave trade and piracy in \\tAlgeria ceased following the French conquest . \\nThe conquest of Algeria by the French took \\tsome time and resulted in considerable bloodshed . \\nA combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian \\tpopulation to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872 . \\nOn 17 September 1860 , Napoleon III declared `` Our first duty is to take care of the \\thappiness of the three million Arabs , whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination . '' \\nDuring this time , only Kabylia resisted , the Kabylians \\twere not colonized until after the Mokrani Revolt in 1871 . \\nFrom 1848 until independence , France administered the whole Mediterranean region of \\tAlgeria as an integral part and `` département '' of the nation . \\nOne of France 's longest-held overseas territories , Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of \\tEuropean immigrants , who became known as `` colons '' and later , as `` Pied-Noirs . '' \\nBetween 1825 and 1847 , 50,000 \\tFrench people emigrated to Algeria . \\nThese settlers benefited from the French government 's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples \\t, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land . \\nMany Europeans settled in Oran and Algiers , and by the early \\t20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities . \\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century , the \\tEuropean share was almost a fifth of the population . \\nThe French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of \\tFrance , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 . \\nThe indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency , but in contrast to the other colonized countries \\t' path in central Asia and Caucasus , Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture . \\nDuring the Second World War , Algeria came under Vichy control before being liberated by the Allies in \\tOperation Torch , which saw the first large-scale deployment of American troops in the North African campaign . \\nGradually , dissatisfaction among the Muslim population , which lacked political and economic status under the \\tcolonial system , gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France . \\nIn May 1945 , the uprising against the occupying French forces was \\tsuppressed through what is now known as the Sétif and Guelma massacre . \\nTensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 , when the first violent events of \\twhat was later called the Algerian War began after the publication of the Declaration of 1 November 1954 . \\nHistorians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed \\tby the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) or by lynch mobs in Algeria . \\nThe FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as \\tpart of its war , and the French conducted severe reprisals . \\nIn addition , the French destroyed over 8,000 villages \\tand relocated over 2 million Algerians to concentration camps . \\nThe war led to the death of hundreds of \\tthousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries . \\nHistorians , like Alistair Horne and Raymond Aron , state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than \\tthe original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence . \\nHorne estimated Algerian casualties during the span \\tof eight years to be around 700,000 . \\nThe war uprooted more \\tthan 2 million Algerians . \\nThe war against French rule concluded in 1962 , when Algeria gained complete \\tindependence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum . \\nThe first three decades of \\tindependence ( 1962–1991 ) . \\nThe number of European `` Pied-Noirs '' who fled \\tAlgeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964 . \\nThe exodus to mainland France accelerated after the Oran massacre of 1962 , in which \\thundreds of militants entered European sections of the city , and began attacking civilians . \\nAlgeria 's first president was the Front de Libération \\tNationale ( FLN ) leader Ahmed Ben Bella . \\nMorocco 's claim to portions of western Algeria \\tled to the Sand War in 1963 . \\nBen Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari \\tBoumédiène , his former ally and defence minister . \\nUnder Ben Bella , the government had become increasingly \\tsocialist and authoritarian ; Boumédienne continued this trend . \\nHowever , he relied much more on the army for his support \\t, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role . \\nHe collectivised agriculture and launched \\ta massive industrialisation drive . \\nOil extraction facilities \\twere nationalised . \\nThis was especially beneficial to the leadership \\tafter the international 1973 oil crisis . \\nBoumédienne 's successor , Chadli Bendjedid \\t, introduced some liberal economic reforms . \\nHe promoted a policy of Arabisation \\tin Algerian society and public life . \\nTeachers of Arabic , brought in from other Muslim countries , spread conventional Islamic \\tthought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam . \\nThe Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil , leading to \\thardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut . \\nEconomic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during \\tthe 1980s ; by the end of the decade , Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system . \\nPolitical parties developed , such as the Islamic Salvation Front \\t( FIS ) , a broad coalition of Muslim groups . \\nCivil War ( 1991–2002 \\t) and aftermath . \\nIn December 1991 the Islamic Salvation Front dominated \\tthe first of two rounds of legislative elections . \\nFearing the election of an Islamist government , the authorities \\tintervened on 11 January 1992 , cancelling the elections . \\nBendjedid resigned and a High Council of State \\twas installed to act as the Presidency . \\nIt banned the FIS , triggering a civil insurgency between the Front 's armed wing , the Armed Islamic \\tGroup , and the national armed forces , in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died . \\nThe Islamist militants conducted a \\tviolent campaign of civilian massacres . \\nAt several points in the conflict , the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern , most \\tnotably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight 8969 , a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group . \\nThe Armed Islamic Group declared \\ta ceasefire in October 1997 . \\nAlgeria held elections in 1999 , considered biased by international observers \\tand most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika . \\nHe worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a `` Civil Concord '' initiative , approved in a referendum , under which many political \\tprisoners were pardoned , and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty , in force until 13 January 2000 . \\nThe AIS disbanded and levels \\tof insurgent violence fell rapidly . \\nThe Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat ( GSPC ) , a splinter \\tgroup of the Armed Islamic Group , continued a terrorist campaign against the Government . \\nBouteflika was re-elected in the April 2004 presidential election \\tafter campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation . \\nThe programme comprised economic , institutional , political and social reform to modernise \\tthe country , raise living standards , and tackle the causes of alienation . \\nIt also included a second amnesty initiative , the Charter for Peace and \\tNational Reconciliation , which was approved in a referendum in September 2005 . \\nIt offered amnesty to most \\tguerrillas and Government security forces . \\nIn November 2008 , the Algerian Constitution was amended following a \\tvote in Parliament , removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents . \\nThis change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the 2009 \\tpresidential elections , and he was re-elected in April 2009 . \\nDuring his election campaign and following his re-election , Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $ 150-billion spending programme to \\tcreate three million new jobs , the construction of one million new housing units , and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes . \\nA continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010 \\t, inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa . \\nOn 24 February 2011 , the government \\tlifted Algeria 's 19-year-old state of emergency . \\nThe government enacted legislation dealing with political parties , the electoral \\tcode , and the representation of women in elected bodies . \\nIn April 2011 , Bouteflika promised \\tfurther constitutional and political reform . \\nHowever , elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international \\thuman rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue . \\nOn 2 April 2019 , Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after \\tmass protests against his candidacy for a fifth term in office . \\nIn December 2019 , Abdelmadjid Tebboune became Algeria 's president , after winning the first round of the presidential \\telection with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria 's democracy in 1989 . \\nTebboune is accused to be close to the \\tmilitary and being loyal to the deposed president . \\nTebboune rejects these accusations , claiming to \\tbe the victim of a witch hunt . \\nHe also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government \\tin August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison . \\nGeography \\t. \\nSince the 2011 breakup of Sudan , and the creation of South Sudan , \\tAlgeria has been the largest country in Africa , and the Mediterranean Basin . \\nIts southern part includes a \\tsignificant portion of the Sahara . \\nTo the north , the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas , further south , two \\tparallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound , and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands . \\nBoth Atlas tend to \\tmerge in eastern Algeria . \\nThe vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the \\tentire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border . \\nThe highest point is \\tMount Tahat ( ) . \\nAlgeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°N ( a small area is north \\tof 37°N and south of 19°N ) , and longitudes 9°W and 12°E . \\nMost of the coastal area is hilly , sometimes even \\tmountainous , and there are a few natural harbours . \\nThe area from the coast to \\tthe Tell Atlas is fertile . \\nSouth of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the \\tSaharan Atlas ; farther south , there is the Sahara desert . \\nThe Hoggar Mountains ( ) , also known as the Hoggar \\t, are a highland region in central Sahara , southern Algeria . \\nThey are located about south of the capital \\t, Algiers , and just east of Tamanghasset . \\nAlgiers , Oran , Constantine , and \\tAnnaba are Algeria 's main cities . \\nClimate and \\thydrology . \\nIn this region , midday desert \\ttemperatures can be hot year round . \\nAfter sunset , however , the clear , dry air permits rapid \\tloss of heat , and the nights are cool to chilly . \\nEnormous daily ranges in \\ttemperature are recorded . \\nRainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas , \\tranging from annually , the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east . \\nPrecipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria \\t, where it reaches as much as in some years . \\nFarther inland , the \\trainfall is less plentiful . \\nAlgeria also has ergs , or \\tsand dunes , between mountains . \\nAmong these , in the summer time when winds are \\theavy and gusty , temperatures can go up to . \\nFauna and \\tflora . \\nThe varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal , mountainous and grassy \\tdesert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife . \\nMany of the creatures comprising the Algerian \\twildlife live in close proximity to civilisation . \\nThe most commonly seen animals include the wild boars , jackals , and gazelles , \\talthough it is not uncommon to spot fennecs ( foxes ) , and jerboas . \\nAlgeria also has a small African leopard and Saharan \\tcheetah population , but these are seldom seen . \\nA species of deer , the Barbary stag , \\tinhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas . \\nThe fennec fox is the \\tnational animal of Algeria . \\nA variety of bird species makes the \\tcountry an attraction for bird watchers . \\nThe forests are inhabited \\tby boars and jackals . \\nBarbary macaques are the \\tsole native monkey . \\nSnakes , monitor lizards , and numerous other reptiles can be found living \\tamong an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria . \\nMany animals are now extinct , including the \\tBarbary lions , Atlas bears and crocodiles . \\nIn the north , some of the native flora includes Macchia \\tscrub , olive trees , oaks , cedars and other conifers . \\nThe mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ( Aleppo pine \\t, juniper , and evergreen oak ) and some deciduous trees . \\nFig , eucalyptus , agave , and various \\tpalm trees grow in the warmer areas . \\nThe grape vine is \\tindigenous to the coast . \\nIn the Sahara region , \\tsome oases have palm trees . \\nAcacias with wild olives are the predominant \\tflora in the remainder of the Sahara . \\nAlgeria had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of \\t5.22/10 , ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries . \\nCamels are used extensively ; the desert also abounds with \\tvenomous and nonvenomous snakes , scorpions , and numerous insects . \\nGovernment and \\tpolitics . \\nElected politicians have relatively \\tlittle sway over Algeria . \\nInstead , a group of unelected civilian and military `` décideurs '' ( `` deciders '' ) , known as `` \\tle pouvoir '' ( `` the power '' ) , actually rule the country , even deciding who should be president . \\nThe most powerful man might have been Mohamed Mediène , the head of \\tmilitary intelligence , before he was brought down during the 2019 protests . \\nIn recent years , many of these generals \\thave died , retired , or been imprisoned . \\nAfter the death of General Larbi Belkheir , previous president Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts , notably at Sonatrach \\t, and secured constitutional amendments that made him re-electable indefinitely , until he was brought down in 2019 during protests . \\nThe head of state is the President of Algeria \\t, who is elected for a five-year term . \\nThe president is limited \\tto two five-year terms . \\nThe most recent presidential election was planned to be in April 2019 , but widespread protests erupted on 22 February against \\tthe president 's decision to participate in the election , which resulted in President Bouteflika announcing his resignation on 3 April . \\nAbdelmadjid Tebboune , an independent candidate , was elected as president \\tafter the election eventually took place on 12 December 2019 . \\nProtestors refused to recognise Tebboune as president , citing \\tdemands for comprehensive reform of the political system . \\nAlgeria has universal suffrage at \\t18 years of age . \\nThe President is the head of the army , \\tthe Council of Ministers and the High Security Council . \\nHe appoints the Prime Minister who \\tis also the head of government . \\nThe Algerian parliament is bicameral ; the lower house , the People 's National Assembly , has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms , while the upper house \\t, the Council of the Nation , has 144 members serving six-year terms , of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president . \\nAccording to the constitution , no political association may be formed if it is `` based \\ton differences in religion , language , race , gender , profession , or region '' . \\nIn addition , political campaigns must \\tbe exempt from the aforementioned subjects . \\nParliamentary elections were last \\theld in May 2017 . \\nIn the elections , the FLN lost 44 of its seats , but remained the largest party with 164 seats , \\tthe military-backed National Rally for Democracy won 100 , and the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Movement of the Society for Peace won 33 . \\nForeign \\trelations . \\nAlgeria is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( \\tENP ) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer . \\nGiving incentives and rewarding best performers , as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner , \\tare the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument ( ENI ) that came into force in 2014 . \\nIt has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides \\tthe bulk of funding through a number of programmes . \\nIn 2009 , the French government agreed to \\tcompensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria . \\nDefence Minister Herve Morin stated that `` It 's time for our country to be at peace with itself , \\tat peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations , '' when presenting the draft law on the payouts . \\nAlgerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first \\tstep and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation . \\nTensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening \\tthe Arab Maghreb Union , nominally established in 1989 , but which has carried little practical weight . \\nOn 24 August 2021 , Algeria announced \\tthe break of diplomatic relations with Morocco . \\nMilitary \\t. \\nThe military of Algeria consists of the People 's National Army ( ANP ) , the Algerian National Navy \\t( MRA ) , and the Algerian Air Force ( QJJ ) , plus the Territorial Air Defence Forces . \\nIt is the direct successor of the National Liberation Army ( Armée de Libération Nationale or ALN ) , the armed \\twing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial occupation during the Algerian War of Independence ( 1954–62 ) . \\nTotal military personnel include 147,000 active , 150,000 reserve \\t, and 187,000 paramilitary staff ( 2008 estimate ) . \\nService in the military is compulsory for men aged \\t19–30 , for a total of 12 months . \\nThe military expenditure was 4.3 % of the \\tgross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2012 . \\nAlgeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the \\tlargest defence budget in Africa ( $ 10 billion ) . \\nMost of Algeria 's weapons are imported from Russia \\t, with whom they are a close ally . \\nIn 2007 , the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase \\t49 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $ 1.9 billion . \\nRussia is also building two \\t636-type diesel submarines for Algeria . \\nHuman \\trights . \\nAlgeria has been categorised by the US government funded Freedom House as `` not free '' since it began publishing such ratings in \\t1972 , with the exception of 1989 , 1990 , and 1991 , when the country was labelled `` partly free . '' \\nIn December 2016 , the `` Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor '' \\tissued a report regarding violation of media freedom in Algeria . \\nIt clarified that the Algerian government imposed restrictions on freedom of the press ; expression ; and right \\tto peaceful demonstration , protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the media and websites . \\nDue to the fact that the journalists and activists criticise the \\truling government , some media organisations ' licenses are cancelled . \\nIndependent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the \\tgovernment , with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed . \\nIn 2016 , a number of unions , many of which were involved \\tin the 2010–2012 Algerian Protests , have been deregistered by the government . \\nHomosexuality is illegal \\tin Algeria . \\nPublic homosexual behavior is punishable by \\tup to two years in prison . \\nDespite this , about 26 % of Algerians think that homosexuality should be accepted \\t, according to the survey conducted by the BBC News Arabic-Arab Barometer in 2019 . \\nAlgeria showed largest LGBT acceptance compared to other \\tArab countries where the survey was conducted . \\nHuman Rights Watch has accused the Algerian authorities of using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to prevent pro-democracy \\tmovements and protests in the country , leading to the arrest of youths as part of social distancing . \\nAdministrative \\tdivisions . \\nAlgeria is divided into 58 provinces ( `` wilayas '' ) , 553 districts \\t( `` daïras '' ) and 1,541 municipalities ( `` baladiyahs '' ) . \\nEach province , district , and municipality is named after \\tits seat , which is usually the largest city . \\nThe administrative divisions have changed \\tseveral times since independence . \\nWhen introducing new provinces , the numbers of old \\tprovinces are kept , hence the non-alphabetical order . \\nWith their official numbers , currently ( \\tsince 1983 ) they are Economy . \\nAlgeria 's currency is the \\tdinar ( DZD ) . \\nThe economy remains dominated by the state , a \\tlegacy of the country 's socialist post-independence development model . \\nIn recent years , the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned \\tindustries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy . \\nThese restrictions are just starting to be lifted off \\trecently although questions about Algeria 's slowly-diversifying economy remain . \\nAlgeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part \\tbecause of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy . \\nThe government 's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the \\tenergy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages . \\nThe country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems , including the need to diversify the economy \\t, strengthen political , economic and financial reforms , improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions . \\nA wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to \\toffer more than $ 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases . \\nPublic spending has increased by 27 % \\tannually during the past 5 years . \\nThe 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US $ 286 billion \\t, 40 % of which will go to human development . \\nThanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues , Algeria has a cushion of $ \\t173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund . \\nIn addition , Algeria 's external debt is \\textremely low at about 2 % of GDP . \\nThe economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth , and , despite high foreign exchange reserves ( US $ 178 billion , equivalent to \\tthree years of imports ) , current expenditure growth makes Algeria 's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues . \\nAlgeria has not joined the WTO , despite several years of negotiations but is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area and the African Continental Free \\tTrade Area , and has an association agreement with the European Union Turkish direct investments have accelerated in Algeria , with total value reaching $ 5 billion . \\nAs of 2022 , the number of Turkish \\tcompanies present in Algeria has reached 1,400 . \\nIn 2020 , despite the pandemic , more \\tthan 130 Turkish companies were created in Algeria . \\nOil and \\tnatural resources . \\nAlgeria , whose economy is reliant on petroleum \\t, has been an OPEC member since 1969 . \\nIts crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day , but it is \\talso a major gas producer and exporter , with important links to Europe . \\nHydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy , accounting for roughly 60 % \\tof budget revenues , 30 % of GDP , and 87.7 % of export earnings . \\nAlgeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in \\tthe world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter . \\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in \\t2005 , Algeria had of proven natural-gas reserves . \\nIt also ranks 16th \\tin oil reserves . \\nNon-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was \\tprojected at 5 % . \\nTo cope with social demands , the authorities raised expenditure , especially on basic \\tfood support , employment creation , support for SMEs , and higher salaries . \\nHigh hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account \\tand the already large international reserves position . \\nIncome from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing \\thigh oil prices , though the trend in production volume is downwards . \\nProduction from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume , continues to decline \\t, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011 . \\nNevertheless , the sector accounted for 98 % of the total volume of exports in 2011 , against \\t48 % in 1962 , and 70 % of budgetary receipts , or US $ 71.4 billion . \\nThe Algerian national oil company is Sonatrach , which plays a key role \\tin all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria . \\nAll foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach \\t, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements . \\nAccess to biocapacity in Algeria \\tis lower than world average . \\nIn 2016 , Algeria had 0.53 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its \\tterritory , much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . \\nIn 2016 , Algeria used 2.4 global hectares of \\tbiocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption . \\nThis means they use just under 4.5 \\ttimes as much biocapacity as Algeria contains . \\nAs a result , Algeria \\tis running a biocapacity deficit . \\nIn April 2022 , diplomats from Italy and Spain held talks after Rome \\t's move to secure large volume of Algerian gas stoked concerns in Madrid . \\nUnder the deal between Algeria 's Sonatrach and Italy 's Eni , Algeria will send an \\tadditional 9 billion cubic metres of gas to Italy by next year and in 2024 . \\nResearch and alternative \\tenergy sources . \\nAlgeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars \\ttowards developing research facilities and paying researchers . \\nThis development program is meant to advance alternative \\tenergy production , especially solar and wind power . \\nAlgeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean , so \\tthe government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel . \\nCurrently , Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over \\t780 research labs , with state-set goals to expand to 1,000 . \\nBesides solar energy , areas of research in Algeria include \\tspace and satellite telecommunications , nuclear power and medical research . \\nLabour \\tmarket . \\nThe overall rate of unemployment was 10 % in 2011 , but remained higher among young \\tpeople , with a rate of 21.5 % for those aged between 15 and 24 . \\nThe government strengthened in 2011 the job programs introduced in 1988 , in particular in the \\tframework of the program to aid those seeking work ( Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle ) . \\nDespite a decline in total unemployment , \\tyouth and women unemployment is high . \\nTourism \\t. \\nThe development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities , but since \\t2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built . \\nThere are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qal ' a of Beni Hammad , the first capital of the Hammadid empire ; Tipasa , a Phoenician and later Roman \\ttown ; and Djémila and Timgad , both Roman ruins ; M'Zab Valley , a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis ; and the Casbah of Algiers , an important citadel . \\nThe only natural World Heritage Site is \\tthe Tassili n'Ajjer , a mountain range . \\nTransport \\t. \\nThe Algerian road network is the densest in Africa ; its length is estimated at \\tof highways , with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85 % . \\nThis network will be complemented by the East-West Highway \\t, a major infrastructure project currently under construction . \\nIt is a 3-way , highway , linking Annaba in \\tthe extreme east to the Tlemcen in the far west . \\nAlgeria is also crossed by the Trans-Sahara \\tHighway , which is now completely paved . \\nThis road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries \\tcrossed : Algeria , Mali , Niger , Nigeria , Chad , and Tunisia . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nAlgeria has a population of an estimated 44 million , of which \\tthe majority , 75 % to 85 % are ethnically Arab . \\nAt the outset of the 20th century \\t, its population was approximately four million . \\nAbout 90 % of Algerians live in the northern , coastal area ; the inhabitants of the \\tSahara desert are mainly concentrated in oases , although some 1.5 million remain nomadic or partly nomadic . \\n28.1 % of Algerians are \\tunder the age of 15 . \\nBetween 90,000 and 165,000 Sahrawis from Western Sahara live in the \\tSahrawi refugee camps , in the western Algerian Sahara desert . \\nThere are also more than 4,000 Palestinian refugees , who are well integrated and have \\tnot asked for assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . \\nIn 2009 , 35,000 Chinese \\tmigrant workers lived in Algeria . \\nThe largest concentration of Algerian migrants outside Algeria is in France , which \\thas reportedly over 1.7 million Algerians of up to the second generation . \\nEthnic \\tgroups . \\nArabs and indigenous Berbers as well as Phoenicians , Romans , Vandals , Byzantine Greeks , Turks \\t, various Sub-Saharan Africans , and French have contributed to the history and culture of Algeria . \\nDescendants of Andalusian refugees are also present in \\tthe population of Algiers and other cities . \\nMoreover , Spanish was spoken by these Aragonese and Castillian Morisco descendants deep into the 18th century , and \\teven Catalan was spoken at the same time by Catalan Morisco descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued . \\nThe majority of the population of Algeria are Arabs ( \\t75 % to 85 % of the population ) . \\nBerbers who make up 15 % to 20 % of \\tthe population are divided into many groups with varying languages . \\nThe largest of these are the Kabyles , who live in the Kabylie region east of Algiers , the \\tChaoui of Northeast Algeria , the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the Shenwa people of North Algeria . \\nDuring the colonial period , there was a large ( 10 % \\tin 1960 ) European population who became known as `` Pied-Noirs '' . \\nThey were primarily of French \\t, Spanish and Italian origin . \\nAlmost all of this population left during the \\twar of independence or immediately after its end . \\nLanguages \\t. \\nModern Standard Arabic and Berber \\tare the official languages . \\nAlgerian Arabic ( Darja ) is the language \\tused by the majority of the population . \\nColloquial Algerian Arabic has some Berber loanwords which represent \\t8 % to 9 % of its vocabulary . \\nBerber has been recognised as a `` national language \\t'' by the constitutional amendment of 8 May 2002 . \\nKabyle , the predominant Berber language , is taught and is partially \\tco-official ( with a few restrictions ) in parts of Kabylie . \\nKabyle has a significant Arabic , French , Latin , Greek , Phoenician and \\tPunic substratum , and Arabic loanwords represent 35 % of the total Kabyle vocabulary . \\nIn February 2016 , the Algerian constitution passed a \\tresolution that made Berber an official language alongside Arabic . \\nAlthough French has no official status in Algeria , it has one of the largest Francophone populations in the world , and French is widely used in government , \\tmedia ( newspapers , radio , local television ) , and both the education system ( from primary school onwards ) and academia due to Algeria 's colonial history . \\nIt can be regarded as \\ta lingua franca of Algeria . \\nIn 2008 , 11.2 million Algerians \\tcould read and write in French . \\nAn Abassa Institute study in April 2000 found that 60 % of households could speak and understand \\tFrench , or 18 million people out of a total of 30 million at the time . \\nFollowing a period during which the Algerian government tried to phase out French , in recent decades the government \\thas changed course and reinforced the study of French , and some television programs are broadcast in the language . \\nAlgeria emerged as a \\tbilingual state after 1962 . \\nColloquial Algerian Arabic is spoken by about 83 % \\tof the population and Berber by 27 % . \\nReligion \\t. \\nIslam is the predominant religion in Algeria , with its adherents , mostly Sunnis , accounting for 99 % of the \\tpopulation according to a 2021 CIA `` World Factbook '' estimate , and 97.9 % according to Pew Research in 2020 . \\nThere are about 290,000 Ibadis in the \\tM'zab Valley in the region of Ghardaia . \\nPrior to independence , Algeria was home to more than \\t1.3 million Christians ( mostly of French ancestry ) . \\nMany Christian settlers left to France \\tafter the independence from France . \\nToday , estimates of the Christian \\tpopulation range from 20,000 to 200,000 . \\nAlgerian citizens who are Christians predominantly belong to Protestant groups , which have \\tseen increased pressure from the government in recent years including many forced closures . \\nAccording to the Arab Barometer in 2018-2019 , the vast majority \\tof Algerians ( 99.1 % ) continue to identify as Muslim . \\nThe June 2019 Arab Barometer-BBC News report found that the percentage of Algerians identifying as \\tnon-religious has grown from around 8 % in 2013 to around 15 % in 2018 . \\nThe Arab Barometer December 2019 , found that the growth in the percentage of Algerians identifying as \\tnon-religious is largely driven by young Algerians , with roughly 25 % describing themselves as non-religious . \\nHowever , the 2021 Arab Barometer report found that those who said they were \\tnot religious among Algerians has decreased , with just 2.6 % identifying as non-religious . \\nIn that same report , 69.5 % of Algerians identified \\tas religious and another 27.8 % identifying as somewhat religious . \\nAlgeria has given the Muslim world a number of prominent thinkers , including Emir Abdelkader \\t, Abdelhamid Ben Badis , Mouloud Kacem Naît Belkacem , Malek Bennabi and Mohamed Arkoun . \\nHealth \\t. \\nIn 2018 , Algeria had the highest numbers of physicians in the Maghreb region ( 1.72 per 1,000 people \\t) , nurses ( 2.23 per 1,000 people ) , and dentists ( 0.31 per 1,000 people ) . \\nAccess to `` improved water sources '' was around 97.4 % of the population \\tin urban areas and 98.7 % of the population in the rural areas . \\nSome 99 % of Algerians living in urban areas , and around 93.4 % \\tof those living in rural areas , had access to `` improved sanitation '' . \\nAccording to the World Bank , Algeria is making progress toward its goal of `` reducing by half \\tthe number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 '' . \\nGiven Algeria 's young population , policy favours \\tpreventive health care and clinics over hospitals . \\nIn keeping with this policy , \\tthe government maintains an immunisation program . \\nHowever , poor sanitation and unclean water still cause tuberculosis , \\thepatitis , measles , typhoid fever , cholera and dysentery . \\nThe poor generally receive health \\tcare free of charge . \\nHealth records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living \\tin the south to their vital record database in 1905 during French rule . \\nEducation \\t. \\nSince the 1970s , in a centralised system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy , the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for \\tall children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence , now the literacy rate is around 92.6 % . \\nSince 1972 , Arabic is used as the language \\tof instruction during the first nine years of schooling . \\nFrom the third year , French is taught and it \\tis also the language of instruction for science classes . \\nThe students can also learn English \\t, Italian , Spanish and German . \\nIn 2008 , new programs at the elementary appeared , therefore the compulsory schooling does \\tnot start at the age of six anymore , but at the age of five . \\nApart from the 122 private schools , the \\tUniversities of the State are free of charge . \\nAfter nine years of primary school , students can go \\tto the high school or to an educational institution . \\nThe school offers two programs \\t: general or technical . \\nAt the end of the third year of secondary school , students pass the exam of the \\tbaccalaureate , which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes . \\nEducation is officially compulsory for children between \\tthe ages of six and 15 . \\nIn 2008 , the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3 \\t% , 15.6 % for men and 29.0 % for women . \\nThe province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was Algiers Province at 11.6 % \\t, while the province with the highest rate was Djelfa Province at 35.5 % . \\nAlgeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education , which \\tmust accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008 . \\nThe University of Algiers , founded in 1879 , is the oldest , it \\toffers education in various disciplines ( law , medicine , science and letters ) . \\nTwenty-five of these universities and almost all of the institutions of \\thigher education were founded after the independence of the country . \\nEven if some of them offer instruction in Arabic like areas of law and the economy , \\tmost of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English . \\nAmong the most important universities , there are the University of Sciences and Technology \\tHouari Boumediene , the University of Mentouri Constantine , and University of Oran Es-Senia . \\nThe University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd in Tlemcen and University of \\tBatna Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa . \\nAlgeria was ranked 120th in the Global Innovation Index \\tin 2021 , down from 113rd in 2019 . \\nCulture \\t. \\nModern Algerian literature , split between Arabic , Tamazight and French \\t, has been strongly influenced by the country 's recent history . \\nFamous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib , Albert Camus \\t, Kateb Yacine and Ahlam Mosteghanemi while Assia Djebar is widely translated . \\nAmong the important novelists of the 1980s were Rachid Mimouni , later vice-president of Amnesty International \\t, and Tahar Djaout , murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views . \\nMalek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization ; Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste ( \\tmodern-day Souk Ahras ) ; and Ibn Khaldun , though born in Tunis , wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria . \\nThe works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times , and of Emir \\tAbdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times , are widely noted . \\nThe Latin author Apuleius was born in Madaurus ( \\tMdaourouch ) , in what later became Algeria . \\nContemporary Algerian cinema is various in terms of genre \\t, exploring a wider range of themes and issues . \\nThere has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war \\tof independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians . \\nArt \\t. \\nAlgerian painters , like or Baya , attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonisation \\t, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria . \\nIn this line , Mohamed Temam , Abdelkhader Houamel have also returned through this art , scenes from \\tthe history of the country , the habits and customs of the past and the country life . \\nOther new artistic currents including the one of M'hamed Issiakhem , Mohammed Khadda and Bachir Yelles , appeared on the scene of Algerian painting , abandoning figurative \\tclassical painting to find new pictorial ways , in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations . \\nMohammed Khadda and M'hamed Issiakhem have \\tbeen notable in recent years . \\nLiterature \\t. \\nThe historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the Numidian and Roman African era , when \\tApuleius wrote `` The Golden Ass '' , the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety . \\nThis period had also known Augustine of Hippo , \\tNonius Marcellus and Martianus Capella , among many others . \\nThe Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionised the Arab world literature , with authors like Ahmad al-Buni \\t, Ibn Manzur and Ibn Khaldoun , who wrote the Muqaddimah while staying in Algeria , and many others . \\nAlbert Camus was an \\tAlgerian-born French Pied-Noir author . \\nIn 1957 , he was awarded \\tthe Nobel Prize in literature . \\nToday Algeria contains , in its literary landscape , big names having not only marked \\tthe Algerian literature , but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French . \\nAs a first step , Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity , there is the publication of novels \\tas the `` Algerian trilogy '' of Mohammed Dib , or even `` Nedjma '' of Kateb Yacine novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work . \\nOther known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include Mouloud Feraoun , Malek Bennabi , Malek Haddad \\t, Moufdi Zakaria , Abdelhamid Ben Badis , Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa , Mouloud Mammeri , Frantz Fanon , and Assia Djebar . \\nIn the aftermath of the independence , several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene , they will attempt through their works to expose \\ta number of social problems , among them there are Rachid Boudjedra , Rachid Mimouni , Leila Sebbar , Tahar Djaout and Tahir Wattar . \\nCurrently , a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression , due to the terrorism that occurred \\tduring the 1990s , the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure . \\nAmong the most noted recent works , there is the writer , `` the swallows of Kabul '' and `` the attack '' of Yasmina Khadra , `` the oath of \\tbarbarians '' of Boualem Sansal , `` memory of the flesh '' of Ahlam Mosteghanemi and the last novel by Assia Djebar `` nowhere in my father 's House '' . \\nMusic \\t. \\nChaâbi music is a typically Algerian musical genre characterized by specific \\trhythms and of Qacidate ( popular poems ) in Arabic dialect . \\nEl Hadj M'Hamed El Anka is considered the \\tgreatest master of the art in modern times . \\nHe wrote over 350 songs and produced some \\t130 records before his death in 1978 . \\nMany of his pupils went \\ton to be renowned musicians . \\nThe Constantinois Malouf style is saved by musician \\tfrom whom Mohamed Tahar Fergani is a performer . \\nFolk music styles include Bedouin music , characterized by the poetic songs based on long kacida ( poems ) ; Kabyle music , based on \\ta rich repertoire that is poetry and old tales passed through generations ; Shawiya music , a folklore from diverse areas of the Aurès Mountains . \\nRahaba music style is \\tunique to the Aures . \\nSouad Massi is a \\trising Algerian folk singer . \\nOther Algerian singers of the diaspora include Manel \\tFilali in Germany and Kenza Farah in France . \\nTergui music is sung in Tuareg languages \\tgenerally , Tinariwen had a worldwide success . \\nFinally , the staïfi music is born in Sétif \\tand remains a unique style of its kind . \\nModern music is available in several facets , Raï \\tmusic is a style typical of western Algeria . \\nRap , a relatively recent style in \\tAlgeria , is experiencing significant growth . \\nCinema \\t. \\nThe Algerian state 's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million ( EUR 1.3 million ) allocated to production , specific measures and \\tan ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production , renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation . \\nThe financial support provided by the state , through the Fund for the Development of the Arts , Techniques and the Film Industry ( \\tFDATIC ) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence ( AARC ) , plays a key role in the promotion of national production . \\nBetween 2007 and 2013 , FDATIC subsidised 98 films \\t( feature films , documentaries and short films ) . \\nIn mid-2013 , AARC had already supported a total of 78 films \\t, including 42 feature films , 6 short films and 30 documentaries . \\nAccording to the European Audiovisual Observatory 's LUMIERE database , 41 Algerian films were distributed \\tin Europe between 1996 and 2013 ; 21 films in this repertoire were Algerian-French co-productions . \\n`` Days of Glory '' ( 2006 ) and `` Outside the Law '' ( 2010 ) \\trecorded the highest number of admissions in the European Union , 3,172,612 and 474,722 , respectively . \\nAlgeria won the Palme d'Or for `` Chronicle of the Years of Fire '' ( 1975 ) , two Oscars for \\t`` Z '' ( 1969 ) , and other awards for the Italian-Algerian movie `` The Battle of Algiers '' . \\nCuisine \\t. \\nAlgerian cuisine is \\trich and diverse . \\nThe country was considered as the \\t`` granary of Rome '' . \\nIt offers a component of dishes and varied dishes , \\tdepending on the region and according to the seasons . \\nThe cuisine uses cereals as the main products , since \\tthey are always produced with abundance in the country . \\nThere is not a dish \\twhere cereals are not present . \\nAlgerian cuisine varies from one region to \\tanother , according to seasonal vegetables . \\nIt can be prepared using \\tmeat , fish and vegetables . \\nAmong the dishes known , couscous , chorba , rechta , chakhchoukha , berkoukes , shakshouka , \\tmthewem , chtitha , mderbel , dolma , brik or bourek , garantita , lham'hlou , etc . \\nMerguez sausage is widely used in Algeria , but it differs \\t, depending on the region and on the added spices . \\nCakes are marketed and can be found in cities \\teither in Algeria , in Europe or North America . \\nHowever , traditional cakes are also made at home \\t, following the habits and customs of each family . \\nAmong these cakes , there are Tamina , Baklawa , Chrik , Garn logzelles , Griouech , Kalb el-louz , Makroud \\t, Mbardja , Mchewek , Samsa , Tcharak , Baghrir , Khfaf , Zlabia , Aarayech , Ghroubiya and Mghergchette . \\nAlgerian pastry also contains \\tTunisian or French cakes . \\nMarketed and home-made bread products include varieties such as Kessra or Khmira \\tor Harchaya , chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue . \\nOther traditional meals sold often as street food include mhadjeb or mahjouba \\t, karantika , doubara , chakhchoukha , hassouna , and t'chicha . \\nSports \\t. \\nVarious games have existed \\tin Algeria since antiquity . \\nIn the Aures , people played several games such as \\tEl Kherba or El khergueba ( chess variant ) . \\nPlaying cards , checkers and chess \\tgames are part of Algerian culture . \\nRacing ( fantasia ) and rifle shooting are \\tpart of cultural recreation of the Algerians . \\nThe first Algerian and African gold medalist is Boughera El \\tOuafi in 1928 Olympics of Amsterdam in the Marathon . \\nThe second Algerian Medalist was Alain Mimoun \\tin 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . \\nSeveral men and women were champions in athletics in the 1990s including Noureddine Morceli , \\tHassiba Boulmerka , Nouria Merah-Benida , and Taoufik Makhloufi , all specialized in middle-distance running . \\nFootball is the most \\tpopular sport in Algeria . \\nSeveral names are engraved in the history of the sport , including Lakhdar Belloumi , Rachid \\tMekhloufi , Hassen Lalmas , Rabah Madjer , Riyad Mahrez , Salah Assad and Djamel Zidane . \\nThe Algeria national football team qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup , 1986 \\tFIFA World Cup , 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup . \\nIn addition , several football clubs have won continental and \\tinternational trophies as the club ES Sétif or JS Kabylia . \\nThe Algerian Football Federation is an association of Algeria football clubs organizing national \\tcompetitions and international matches of the selection of Algeria national football team . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 359 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=359 '' title= '' List of Atlas Shrugged characters \\t'' > List of Atlas Shrugged characters This is a list of characters in Ayn Rand 's 1957 novel `` Atlas Shrugged . '' \\nMajor \\tcharacters . \\nThe following are major \\tcharacters from the novel . \\nProtagonists \\t. \\nDagny \\tTaggart . \\nDagny Taggart is the \\tprotagonist of the novel . \\nShe is vice-president in Charge of Operations for Taggart \\tTranscontinental , under her brother , James Taggart . \\nGiven James ' incompetence , Dagny is responsible \\tfor all the workings of the railroad . \\nFrancisco \\td'Anconia . \\nFrancisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in `` Atlas Shrugged '' \\t, an owner by inheritance of the world 's largest copper mining operation . \\nHe is a childhood friend , and \\tthe first love , of Dagny Taggart . \\nA child prodigy of exceptional talents , Francisco was dubbed the `` climax \\t'' of the d'Anconia line , an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists . \\nHe was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld \\tand student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler . \\nHe began working while still in school , “ proving ” that he could \\thave made a fortune without the aid of his family 's wealth and power . \\nLater , Francisco bankrupts the d'Anconia business to \\tput it out of others ' reach . \\nHis full name is given as `` \\tFrancisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia '' . \\nJohn \\tGalt . \\nJohn Galt is the primary male \\thero of `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nHe initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental , who often dines with Eddie Willers in \\tthe employees ' cafeteria , and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental . \\nOnly Eddie 's side of their \\tconversations is given in the novel . \\nLater in the novel , the reader \\tdiscovers this worker 's true identity . \\nBefore working for Taggart Transcontinental , Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company , where he secretly invented a generator of usable \\telectric energy from ambient static electricity , but abandoned his prototype , and his employment , when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment . \\nThis prototype was found by \\tDagny Taggart and Hank Rearden . \\nGalt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel , working a job and living by \\thimself , where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership . \\nMuch of the book 's third division is given to his \\tbroadcast speech , which presents the author 's philosophy of Objectivism . \\nHenry `` Hank \\t'' Rearden . \\nHenry ( known as `` Hank '' ) Rearden is \\tone of the central characters in `` Atlas Shrugged '' . \\nHe owns the most important steel company in the United States , and invents \\tRearden Metal , an alloy stronger , lighter , cheaper and tougher than steel . \\nHe lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian , \\this brother Philip , and his elderly mother . \\nRearden represents a type of self-made man and eventually divorces Lillian , abandons his steel \\tmills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers , and joins John Galt 's strike . \\nEddie \\tWillers . \\nEdwin `` Eddie '' Willers is the Special Assistant to \\tthe Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental . \\nHis father and grandfather worked for \\tthe Taggarts , and himself likewise . \\nHe is completely loyal to \\tDagny and to Taggart Transcontinental . \\nWillers does not possess the creative ability of Galt 's associates , but matches them \\tin moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations . \\nAfter Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the \\tcaptive Galt , Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse . \\nRagnar \\tDanneskjöld . \\nOne of Galt 's first followers , and world-famous as a pirate , who seizes \\trelief ships sent from the United States to the People 's States of Europe . \\nHe works to ensure that once those espousing Galt 's philosophy are restored to \\ttheir rightful place in society , they have enough capital to rebuild the world . \\nKept in the background for much of the book , Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult \\tsituation , and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years . \\nDanneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow ; their relationship is kept hidden from \\tthe outside world , which only knows of Ludlow as a retired film star . \\nConsidered a misfit by Galt 's other adherents , he views his actions \\tas a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt 's perspective . \\nAccording to Barbara Branden , who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written \\t, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld 's adventures at sea , cut from the final published text . \\nIn a 1974 comment at a lecture , Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld 's name was a tribute \\tto Victor Hugo 's novel , , wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld . \\nIn the published book , Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( Dagny \\tTaggart or Hank Rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter . \\nAntagonists \\t. \\nJames \\tTaggart . \\nThe President of Taggart Transcontinental and \\tthe book 's most important antagonist . \\nTaggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable \\tof making operational decisions on his own . \\nHe relies on his sister , Dagny Taggart , to actually run the railroad , but \\tnonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs . \\nIn a sense , he \\tis the antithesis of Dagny . \\nThis contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life : the desire to overcome those \\ton whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this . \\nIn the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental \\tbreakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect . \\nLillian \\tRearden . \\nThe unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( \\tsecretly at first ) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value . \\nLillian achieves this , when she passes information to James \\tTaggart about her husband 's affair with his sister . \\nThis information is used to blackmail Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate \\twhich delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others . \\nLillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual \\tsatisfaction , until Hank abandons her . \\nDr. Floyd \\tFerris . \\nFerris is a biologist who works as `` \\tco-ordinator '' at the State Science Institute . \\nHe uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and \\tpublishes a book entitled `` Why Do You Think You Think ? '' \\nHe clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden , and \\ttwice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal . \\nHe is also one of the group of looters who tries \\tto get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan . \\nFerris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon , and \\tis the creator of the Ferris Persuader , a torture machine . \\nWhen John Galt is captured by the looters , Ferris uses the device on \\tGalt , but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt . \\nFerris represents the group which uses brute force on \\tthe heroes to achieve the ends of the looters . \\nDr. Robert \\tStadler . \\nA former professor at Patrick Henry University , and along with colleague Hugh \\tAkston , mentor to Francisco d'Anconia , John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld . \\nHe has since become a sell-out , one who had great promise but \\tsquandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free . \\nHe works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use \\tby the military , including a sound-based weapon known as Project X ( Xylophone ) . \\nHe is killed when Cuffy Meigs ( see below ) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X \\t, causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius . \\nThe character was , in part , modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer , whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons. \\t` To his former student Galt , Stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the `` man who knew better '' but chose not to act for the good . \\nWesley \\tMouch . \\nThe incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington , who \\trises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty . \\nIn return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to \\tone , forces Hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources . \\nLater in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator , \\ta position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country . \\nMouch 's mantra , whenever a problem arises from his prior policy \\t, is to say , `` I ca n't help it . \\nI need wider \\tpowers . '' \\nSecondary \\tcharacters . \\nThe following secondary characters also \\tappear in the novel . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 369 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=369 '' title= ''

Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity , concerned with human behavior , human biology , cultures , societies , and linguistics , in both the present and past , including past human species . \\nSocial anthropology studies patterns of behavior , while cultural \\tanthropology studies cultural meaning , including norms and values . \\nA portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology \\tis commonly used today . \\nLinguistic anthropology studies how \\tlanguage influences social life . \\nBiological or physical anthropology studies \\tthe biological development of humans . \\nArchaeological anthropology , often termed as “ anthropology of the past \\t, ” studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence . \\nIt is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia , while in Europe archaeology is viewed \\tas a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines , such as history and palaeontology . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe abstract noun `` anthropology '' is \\tfirst attested in reference to history . \\nIts present use first appeared in Renaissance Germany in \\tthe works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann . \\nTheir New Latin ' derived from the combining forms of the Greek words `` ánthrōpos '' \\t( , `` human '' ) and `` lógos '' ( , `` study '' ) . \\nIts adjectival form appeared in \\tthe works of Aristotle . \\nIt began to be used in English , possibly \\tvia French ' , by the early 18th century . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThrough the \\t19th century . \\nIn 1647 , the Bartholins , early scholars of the University of Copenhagen , defined `` '' as follows : Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to \\tdescribe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the French National Museum of Natural History by Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau . \\nVarious short-lived organizations of anthropologists \\thad already been formed . \\nThe Société Ethnologique de Paris , the first to use \\tthe term `` ethnology '' , was formed in 1839 . \\nIts members were \\tprimarily anti-slavery activists . \\nWhen slavery was abolished in France in 1848 \\t, the `` Société '' was abandoned . \\nMeanwhile , the Ethnological Society of New York , currently the American Ethnological Society , was founded on its model in 1842 \\t, as well as the Ethnological Society of London in 1843 , a break-away group of the Aborigines ' Protection Society . \\nThese anthropologists of the times were liberal \\t, anti-slavery , and pro-human-rights activists . \\nThey maintained \\tinternational connections . \\nAnthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results \\tof the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century . \\nTheorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning \\tto suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then . \\nFor them , the publication of Charles Darwin 's `` On the Origin \\tof Species '' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect . \\nDarwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species \\the had seen in agronomy and in the wild . \\nDarwin and Wallace unveiled evolution \\tin the late 1850s . \\nThere was an immediate rush to \\tbring it into the social sciences . \\nPaul Broca in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form the first of \\tthe explicitly anthropological societies , the Société d'Anthropologie de Paris , meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859 . \\nWhen he read Darwin , he became an immediate convert \\tto `` Transformisme '' , as the French called evolutionism . \\nHis definition now became `` the study of the human group , considered as a \\twhole , in its details , and in relation to the rest of nature '' . \\nBroca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon \\t, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech . \\nHe wanted to localize the difference between man and the \\tother animals , which appeared to reside in speech . \\nHe discovered the speech center of the human brain \\t, today called Broca 's area after him . \\nHis interest was mainly in Biological anthropology , but a German philosopher specializing in psychology , Theodor Waitz , took up \\tthe theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work , entitled `` Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker '' , 1859–1864 . \\nThe title was soon translated as `` \\tThe Anthropology of Primitive Peoples '' . \\nThe last two volumes \\twere published posthumously . \\nWaitz defined anthropology as `` the science \\tof the nature of man '' . \\nFollowing Broca 's lead , Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would \\tdiffer from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from `` the animals nearest to him '' . \\nHe stresses that the data of comparison \\tmust be empirical , gathered by experimentation . \\nThe history of civilization , as well as ethnology \\t, are to be brought into the comparison . \\nIt is to be presumed fundamentally that the species , man , is a unity \\t, and that `` the same laws of thought are applicable to all men '' . \\nWaitz was influential \\tamong British ethnologists . \\nIn 1863 , the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London \\tto form the Anthropological Society of London , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology . \\nIt was the 2nd society dedicated \\tto general anthropology in existence . \\nRepresentatives from the French `` Société '' \\twere present , though not Broca . \\nIn his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , `` The \\tAnthropological Review '' , Hunt stressed the work of Waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard . \\nAmong the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor , inventor \\tof cultural anthropology , and his brother Alfred Tylor , a geologist . \\nPreviously Edward had referred to himself as \\tan ethnologist ; subsequently , an anthropologist . \\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed : The Anthropological Society of Madrid ( 1865 ) , the American Anthropological Association in 1902 , the \\tAnthropological Society of Vienna ( 1870 ) , the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology ( 1871 ) , and many others subsequently . \\nThe majority of \\tthese were evolutionists . \\nOne notable exception was the Berlin Society for Anthropology , Ethnology , and Prehistory ( \\t1869 ) founded by Rudolph Virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists . \\nNot religious himself , he insisted that \\tDarwin 's conclusions lacked empirical foundation . \\nDuring the last three decades of the 19th century , a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred \\t, most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association . \\nThe major theorists belonged \\tto these organizations . \\nThey supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula \\tinto the major institutions of higher learning . \\nBy 1898 , 48 educational institutions in \\t13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology . \\nNone of the 75 faculty members \\twere under a department named anthropology . \\n20th and \\t21st centuries . \\nThis meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the \\tmajority of the world 's higher educational institutions , many thousands in number . \\nAnthropology has diversified from a few \\tmajor subdivisions to dozens more . \\nPractical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example \\t, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene . \\nThe organization has reached \\ta global level . \\nFor example , the World Council of Anthropological Associations ( WCAA ) , `` a network of national , regional and international \\tassociations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology '' , currently contains members from about three dozen nations . \\nSince the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , `` social '' anthropology in Great Britain and `` cultural '' anthropology in the US have \\tbeen distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons , long-term in-depth examination of context , and the importance they place on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research . \\nCultural anthropology , in particular , has emphasized cultural relativism , \\tholism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques . \\nThis has been particularly prominent in the United States , from Boas ' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology , through Margaret \\tMead 's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation , to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism . \\nEthnography is one of its primary research designs as well \\tas the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork . \\nIn Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries , the \\tBritish tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate . \\nIn the United States , anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century : `` biological '' \\tor `` physical '' anthropology ; `` social '' , `` cultural '' , or `` sociocultural '' anthropology ; and archaeological anthropology ; plus linguistic anthropology . \\nThese fields frequently overlap but tend \\tto use different methodologies and techniques . \\nEuropean countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology ( a \\tterm coined and defined by Adam F. Kollár in 1783 ) . \\nIt is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts \\tof the world that were influenced by the European tradition . \\nFields \\t. \\nAnthropology is a global discipline involving humanities \\t, social sciences and natural sciences . \\nAnthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of `` Homo sapiens '' , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how \\tthe evolutionary past of `` Homo sapiens '' has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etc . \\nEarly anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand \\tobservable cultural diversity , such as by Al-Biruni of the Islamic Golden Age . \\nAs such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new ( late 20th \\tcentury ) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies . \\nAccording to Clifford Geertz , Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and \\tpostmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies . \\nDuring the 1970s and 1990s , there was an epistemological shift \\taway from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline . \\nDuring this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of \\tknowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology . \\nIn contrast , archaeology and \\tbiological anthropology remained largely positivist . \\nDue to this difference in epistemology , the four sub-fields \\tof anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades . \\nSociocultural \\t. \\nSociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes \\tof cultural anthropology and social anthropology . \\nCultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people `` make sense '' of the \\tworld around them , while social anthropology is the study of the `` relationships '' among individuals and groups . \\nCultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects the experience for self and group , contributing to \\ta more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history . \\nIn that , it helps develop an understanding of social structures , typically of others \\tand other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc . ) . \\nThere is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , \\tand these categories overlap to a considerable degree . \\nInquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt \\tto understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values . \\nAccepting other cultures in their own \\tterms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison . \\nThis project is often accommodated \\tin the field of ethnography . \\nEthnography can refer to both a methodology and \\tthe product of ethnographic research , i.e . \\nan ethnographic \\tmonograph . \\nAs a methodology , ethnography is based upon long-term \\tfieldwork within a community or other research site . \\nParticipant observation is one of the foundational \\tmethods of social and cultural anthropology . \\nEthnology involves the systematic \\tcomparison of different cultures . \\nThe process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an \\temic ( conceptual , vs. etic , or technical ) point of view . \\nThe study of kinship and social organization is a central focus \\tof sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal . \\nSociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , \\tmyth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology ) . \\nComparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural \\tanthropology , including the industrialized ( and de-industrialized ) West . \\nThe Standard Cross-Cultural Sample ( SCCS \\t) includes 186 such cultures . \\nBiological \\t. \\nBiological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the \\tstudy of humans and non-human primates in their biological , evolutionary , and demographic dimensions . \\nIt examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and \\tother primates , and that generate , maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation . \\nArchaeological \\t. \\nArchaeology is the study of the \\thuman past through its material remains . \\nArtifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are \\tevidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies . \\nArchaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce \\tpatterns of past human behavior and cultural practices . \\nEthnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a \\tbetter understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways . \\nLinguistic \\t. \\nLinguistic anthropology ( not to be confused with anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal \\t, variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . \\nIt is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems \\t, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . \\nLinguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , \\tcognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis . \\nEthnography \\t. \\nEthnography is a method of \\tanalysing social or cultural interaction . \\nIt often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also \\tdraw from texts written by participants of in social interactions . \\nEthnography views first-hand experience and \\tsocial context as important . \\nTim Ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human \\texperience , applicable in general and novel settings , while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity . \\nHe argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory \\t, but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another . \\nKey topics by \\tfield : sociocultural . \\nArt , media , music \\t, dance and film . \\nArt \\t. \\nOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art \\tconcerns the universality of 'art ' as a cultural phenomenon . \\nSeveral anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting ' , 'sculpture ' , or 'literature ' , conceived as \\tindependent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non-Western contexts . \\nTo surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects \\twhich , without exclusively being 'artistic ' , have certain evident 'aesthetic ' qualities . \\nBoas ' `` Primitive Art '' , Claude Lévi-Strauss ' `` The Way of the Masks '' ( 1982 ) or Geertz 's 'Art as Cultural \\tSystem ' ( 1983 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics ' . \\nMedia \\t. \\nMedia anthropology ( also known as the anthropology of media or mass media ) emphasizes ethnographic studies as \\ta means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media . \\nThe types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ( e.g. , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists \\tin the field , film production ) to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media . \\nOther types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other \\tareas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education . \\nThis is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press \\t, new media , and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s . \\nMusic \\t. \\nEthnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music ( broadly defined ) , that emphasize its cultural , social , \\tmaterial , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire . \\nEthnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields \\t, such as teaching , politics , cultural anthropology etc . \\nWhile the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries , it \\twas formally introduced as `` ethnomusicology '' by Dutch scholar Jaap Kunst around 1950 . \\nLater , the influence of study in this area spawned the creation \\tof the periodical `` Ethnomusicology '' and the Society of Ethnomusicology . \\nVisual \\t. \\nVisual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production \\tof ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-1990s , new media . \\nWhile the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual \\trepresentation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . \\nVisual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , \\tscrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphs , paintings , and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology . \\nEconomic , political economic \\t, applied and development . \\nEconomic \\t. \\nEconomic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in \\tits widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . \\nIt has a complex relationship with the discipline of \\teconomics , of which it is highly critical . \\nIts origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology , Bronisław Malinowski , and his French \\tcompatriot , Marcel Mauss , on the nature of gift-giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange . \\nEconomic Anthropology remains , for the \\tmost part , focused upon exchange . \\nThe school of thought derived from Marx and known \\tas Political Economy focuses on production , in contrast . \\nEconomic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now \\tturned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective . \\nPolitical \\teconomy . \\nPolitical economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to \\tthe traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non-capitalist societies . \\nPolitical economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to \\tahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture . \\nThree main areas of \\tinterest rapidly developed . \\nThe first of these areas was concerned with the `` pre-capitalist \\t'' societies that were subject to evolutionary `` tribal '' stereotypes . \\nSahlin 's work on hunter-gatherers as the `` original \\taffluent society '' did much to dissipate that image . \\nThe second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world 's population at the time \\t, the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam . \\nThe third area was on colonialism , imperialism \\t, and the creation of the capitalist world-system . \\nMore recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues \\tof industrial ( and post-industrial ) capitalism around the world . \\nApplied \\t. \\nApplied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory \\tof anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems . \\nIt is a `` complex of related , research-based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific \\tcultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and/or the formulation of policy '' . \\nApplied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research ; \\tit includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community . \\nIt is closely related to development anthropology ( distinct \\tfrom the more critical anthropology of development ) . \\nDevelopment \\t. \\nAnthropology of development tends to view development \\tfrom a `` critical '' perspective . \\nThe kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why , \\tif a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing ? \\nWhy is there such a \\tgap between plans and outcomes ? \\nWhy are those working in development so willing to \\tdisregard history and the lessons it might offer ? \\nWhy is development so externally driven \\trather than having an internal basis ? \\nIn short , why does \\tso much planned development fail ? \\nKinship , feminism , \\tgender and sexuality . \\nKinship \\t. \\n`` Kinship '' can refer both to `` the study of '' the patterns of social relationships in one \\tor more human cultures , or it can refer to `` the patterns of social relationships '' themselves . \\nOver its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as `` descent '' , `` \\tdescent groups '' , `` lineages '' , `` affines '' , `` cognates '' , and even `` fictive kinship '' . \\nBroadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent \\t( one 's social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage . \\nWithin kinship you have \\ttwo different families . \\nPeople have their biological families and it \\tis the people they share DNA with . \\nThis is called consanguineal relations \\tor `` blood ties '' . \\nPeople can also have a chosen family in which they chose \\twho they want to be a part of their family . \\nIn some cases people are closer with their \\tchosen family more than with their biological families . \\nFeminist \\t. \\nFeminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ( archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic ) that \\tseeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge . \\nAnthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions , whose perspectives and experiences can \\tdiffer from those of white feminists of Europe , America , and elsewhere . \\nFrom the perspective of the Western world , historically such 'peripheral ' perspectives have been ignored , observed \\tonly from an outsider perspective , and regarded as less-valid or less-important than knowledge from the Western world . \\nExploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial \\tor ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology . \\nFeminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology , along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the `` patriarchal origins of anthropology ( and ( academia ) '' and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology \\twent to males more than 85 % , more than 81 % were under 35 , and only 7.2 % to anyone over 40 years old , thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first-wave feminists until later in life . \\nThis correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory \\t, history , linguistics , archaeology , and anthropology . \\nFeminist anthropologists are often concerned with \\tthe construction of gender across societies . \\nGender constructs are of particular \\tinterest when studying sexism . \\nAccording to St. Clair Drake , Vera Mae Green was , until `` [ w ] \\tell into the 1960s '' , the only African-American female anthropologist who was also a Caribbeanist . \\nShe studied ethnic and family relations in the Caribbean as well as the United States , \\tand thereby tried to improve the way black life , experiences , and culture were studied . \\nHowever , Zora Neale Hurston , although often primarily considered to be a literary author , was trained in anthropology by Franz Boas \\t, and published `` Tell my Horse '' about her `` anthropological observations '' of voodoo in the Caribbean ( 1938 ) . \\nFeminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization , \\twhich is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies . \\nMedical , nutritional , psychological \\t, cognitive and transpersonal . \\nMedical \\t. \\nMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies `` human health \\tand disease , health care systems , and biocultural adaptation '' . \\nIt is believed that William Caudell was the \\tfirst to discover the field of medical anthropology . \\nCurrently , research in medical anthropology is one of the main \\tgrowth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole . \\nIt focuses on the following six basic fields : Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering ( Farmer , 1999 \\t, 2003 ; Beneduce , 2010 ) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness . \\nOn the other hand , there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and \\ttheoretical production , such as `` cultural psychiatry '' and `` transcultural psychiatry '' or `` ethnopsychiatry '' . \\nNutritional \\t. \\nNutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , \\tnutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . \\nIf economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , \\tthen this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization . \\nNutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development \\t( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people . \\nPsychological \\t. \\nPsychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that \\tstudies the interaction of cultural and mental processes . \\nThis subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group – with its own history \\t, language , practices , and conceptual categories – shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health . \\nIt also examines how the understanding of cognition , emotion , motivation , and \\tsimilar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes . \\nCognitive \\t. \\nCognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental \\tpsychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms . \\nCognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that \\timplicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them . \\nTranspersonal \\t. \\nTranspersonal anthropology studies the relationship between \\taltered states of consciousness and culture . \\nAs with transpersonal psychology , the field is much concerned with \\taltered states of consciousness ( ASC ) and transpersonal experience . \\nHowever , the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues – for instance \\t, the roles of myth , ritual , diet , and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences . \\nPolitical and \\tlegal . \\nPolitical \\t. \\nPolitical anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked \\tat from the basis of the structure of societies . \\nPolitical anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started \\tincreasingly to study more `` complex '' social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena . \\nThe turn towards complex societies meant that political \\tthemes were taken up at two main levels . \\nFirstly , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside \\tthe state-regulated sphere ( as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization ) . \\nSecondly , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their \\tinstitutions ( and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions ) . \\nAn anthropology of the state developed , and \\tit is a most thriving field today . \\nGeertz ' comparative work on `` Negara '' , the \\tBalinese state , is an early , famous example . \\nLegal \\t. \\nLegal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in \\t`` the cross-cultural study of social ordering '' . \\nEarlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict \\tmanagement , crime , sanctions , or formal regulation . \\nMore recent applications include issues such as human \\trights , legal pluralism , and political uprisings . \\nPublic \\t. \\nPublic anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky , a professor at Hawaii Pacific University , to `` demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond \\tthe discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad , public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change '' . \\nNature , science \\t, and technology . \\nCyborg \\t. \\nCyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the \\tAmerican Anthropological Association 's annual meeting in 1993 . \\nThe sub-group was very closely related to STS and \\tthe Society for the Social Studies of Science . \\nDonna Haraway 's 1985 `` Cyborg Manifesto '' could be considered the founding document \\tof cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . \\nCyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically \\tmodern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings . \\nDigital \\t. \\nDigital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era \\ttechnology , and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect . \\nIt is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology , \\tand sometimes considered part of material culture . \\nThe field is new , and thus has a \\tvariety of names with a variety of emphases . \\nThese include techno-anthropology , digital ethnography \\t, cyberanthropology , and virtual anthropology . \\nEcological \\t. \\nEcological anthropology is defined as the `` \\tstudy of cultural adaptations to environments '' . \\nThe sub-field is also defined as , `` the study of \\trelationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment '' . \\nThe focus of its research concerns `` how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations \\tadapt to their environments , and how their environments change across space and time . \\nThe contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology , and arguably at least the backdrop , if not \\tthe focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today , is political ecology . \\nMany characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture , politics \\tand power , globalization , localized issues , century anthropology and more . \\nThe focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation \\tof policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land . \\nOften , the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly ( \\torganizing , participation ) or indirectly ( articles , documentaries , books , ethnographies ) . \\nSuch is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker \\tand her relationship with the people of Hyde Park . \\nEnvironment \\t. \\nSocial sciences , like anthropology , can \\tprovide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment . \\nProfessor Kay Milton , Director of the Anthropology research network in the School of History and Anthropology , describes \\tanthropology as distinctive , with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non-industrial indigenous and traditional societies . \\nAnthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture ; not an \\texclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition . \\nMilton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology : dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective , reaction against cartesian dualisms \\twhich obstructs progress in theory ( nature culture divide ) , and finally an increased attention to globalization ( transcending the barriers or time/space ) . \\nEnvironmental discourse appears to be characterized \\tby a high degree of globalization . \\n( The troubling problem is borrowing non-indigenous practices and creating standards \\t, concepts , philosophies and practices in western countries . ) \\nAnthropology and environmental discourse now have become a \\tdistinct position in anthropology as a discipline . \\nKnowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing \\tenvironmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology . \\nHuman activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change , a study commonly found in \\thuman ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed . \\nOther ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts \\t, or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral/universal , etc . \\nIn exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the \\tenvironment should be protected , particularly from the harmful effects of human activities . \\nEnvironmentalism itself can be \\texpressed in many ways . \\nAnthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society , understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships , knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are \\taffected by , dependent and independent variables , `` primitive '' ecological wisdom , diverse environments , resource management , diverse cultural traditions , and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture . \\nHistorical \\t. \\nEthnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures \\tand indigenous customs by examining historical records . \\nIt is also the study of the history of various \\tethnic groups that may or may not exist today . \\nEthnohistory uses both historical and \\tethnographic data as its foundation . \\nIts historical methods and materials go beyond \\tthe standard use of documents and manuscripts . \\nPractitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral \\ttradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names . \\nReligion \\t. \\nThe anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other \\tsocial institutions , and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures . \\nModern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion , and that \\tevery religion is a cultural product , created by the human community that worships it . \\nUrban \\t. \\nUrban anthropology is concerned with issues of \\turbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism . \\nUlf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were \\t`` a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition '' . \\nVarious social processes in the Western World as well as in the `` Third World '' ( the latter being the habitual \\tfocus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of `` specialists in 'other cultures ' '' closer to their homes . \\nThere are two main approaches to urban anthropology : examining the \\ttypes of cities or examining the social issues within the cities . \\nThese two methods are overlapping \\tand dependent of each other . \\nBy defining different types of cities , one would use social factors \\tas well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities . \\nBy directly looking at the different social issues , one would \\talso be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city . \\nKey topics by field \\t: archaeological and biological . \\nAnthrozoology \\t. \\nAnthrozoology ( also known as `` human–animal studies '' \\t) is the study of interaction between living things . \\nIt is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , \\tincluding anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology . \\nA major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects \\tof human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions . \\nIt includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , \\tincluding anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy . \\nBiocultural \\t. \\nBiocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of \\tthe relationships between human biology and culture . \\nPhysical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective \\t; that is , from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences . \\nAfter World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an \\teffort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology . \\nEvolutionary \\t. \\nEvolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology \\tand human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates . \\nEvolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social \\tscience , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors . \\nEvolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and \\tcultural evolution of humans , past and present . \\nIt is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such \\tas archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics . \\nIt is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines \\tof evidence to understand the human experience , past and present . \\nForensic \\t. \\nForensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting \\t, most often in criminal cases where the victim 's remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition . \\nA forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals \\twhose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable . \\nThe adjective `` forensic '' refers to the application of \\tthis subfield of science to a court of law . \\nPalaeoanthropology \\t. \\nPaleoanthropology combines the disciplines of \\tpaleontology and physical anthropology . \\nIt is the study of ancient humans , as found \\tin fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints . \\nGenetics and morphology of specimens are \\tcrucially important to this field . \\nMarkers on specimens , such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth \\t, can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations . \\nOrganizations \\t. \\nContemporary anthropology is an established science with \\tacademic departments at most universities and colleges . \\nThe single largest organization of anthropologists is the American Anthropological \\tAssociation ( AAA ) , which was founded in 1903 . \\nIts members are anthropologists \\tfrom around the globe . \\nIn 1989 , a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the European Association \\tof Social Anthropologists ( EASA ) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe . \\nThe EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of \\tmarginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology . \\nHundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology , sometimes divided up by nation or region , and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines , such \\tas geology , physics , zoology , paleontology , anatomy , music theory , art history , sociology and so on , belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well . \\nEthics \\t. \\nAs the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects \\tof anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves , and professional societies have generated codes of ethics . \\nAnthropologists , like other researchers ( especially historians and scientists engaged in field research \\t) , have over time assisted state policies and projects , especially colonialism . \\nSome commentators have contended \\t: Cultural relativism . \\nAs part of their quest for scientific objectivity , present-day anthropologists typically urge \\tcultural relativism , which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology . \\nThis is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another 's \\tvalues or viewpoints , but be examined dispassionately on their own terms . \\nThere should be no notions , in good anthropology , \\tof one culture being better or worse than another culture . \\nEthical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism \\t, sexism , mutilation ( including circumcision and subincision ) , and torture . \\nTopics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies , \\tto genes , to acculturation , to colonialism , have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences . \\nTo illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such \\tas `` racism '' and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields . \\nMilitary \\tinvolvement . \\nAnthropologists ' involvement with the U.S. government , in \\tparticular , has caused bitter controversy within the discipline . \\nFranz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I , and after the war he published a brief \\texpose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists . \\nBut by the 1940s , many of Boas ' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war \\teffort against the Axis Powers ( Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy , and Imperial Japan ) . \\nMany served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for \\texample , Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information ) . \\nAt the same time , David H. Price 's work on American anthropology during the Cold War \\tprovides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies . \\nAttempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence \\tactivities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little . \\nMany anthropologists ( students and teachers ) \\twere active in the antiwar movement . \\nNumerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly \\tat the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association ( AAA ) . \\nProfessional anthropological bodies often object to the use \\tof anthropology for the benefit of the state . \\nTheir codes of ethics or statements may \\tproscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings . \\nThe Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth \\t( ASA ) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous . \\nThe `` Principles of Professional Responsibility '' issued by the American Anthropological Association and amended through November 1986 stated that `` in relation with their own \\tgovernment and with host governments ... no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given . '' \\nThe current `` Principles of Professional Responsibility '' does \\tnot make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions . \\nAnthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the \\tUS military as part of the US Army 's strategy in Afghanistan . \\n`` The Christian Science Monitor '' reports that `` Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs '' in Afghanistan , under \\tthe `` Human Terrain System '' ( HTS ) program ; in addition , HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq . \\nIn 2009 , the American Anthropological Association 's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , `` When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , \\twhere data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology . \\nIn summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with \\tdisciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of `` anthropology '' within DoD . '' \\nPost-World War \\tII developments . \\nBefore WWII British 'social anthropology ' and American \\t'cultural anthropology ' were still distinct traditions . \\nAfter the war , enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from \\tone another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural ' anthropology . \\nBasic \\ttrends . \\nThere are several characteristics that \\ttend to unite anthropological work . \\nOne of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a \\tcomparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical . \\nThe quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place , problem or phenomenon in detail , \\tusing a variety of methods , over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia . \\nIn the 1990s and 2000s , calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows \\twhere his or her own culture ends and another begins , and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard . \\nThese dynamic relationships , between what can be observed on the ground , as opposed to what can be observed by \\tcompiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology , whether cultural , biological , linguistic or archaeological . \\nBiological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human \\tuniversals ( behaviors , ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures ) . \\nThey use many different methods of study , but modern population genetics , participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists `` into \\tthe field , '' which means traveling to a community in its own setting , to do something called `` fieldwork . '' \\nOn the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples \\t, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs . \\nAlong with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically \\tdivide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . \\nHuman time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material \\t, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . \\nFurther cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or \\tLevalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . \\nAnthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well \\t, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . \\nBy making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , \\tanthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science . \\nCommonalities between \\tfields . \\nBecause anthropology developed from so many different enterprises ( see History of anthropology ) , including but not limited to fossil-hunting , exploring , documentary film-making , paleontology , primatology , antiquity dealings and curatorship , philology , etymology , \\tgenetics , regional analysis , ethnology , history , philosophy , and religious studies , it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article , although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made . \\nSome authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of `` other cultures '' \\t, both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( non-European/non-Western societies ) . \\nFor example , the classic of urban anthropology , Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal `` Exploring the City : Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology '' mentions that the `` Third World '' \\thad habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in `` other cultures '' looked for them far away and started to look `` across the tracks '' only in late 1960s . \\nNow there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics \\tvery close to the author 's `` home '' . \\nIt is also argued that other fields of study , like History \\tand Sociology , on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West . \\nIn France , the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists , but this is increasingly changing , starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like `` Terrain \\t'' ( `` fieldwork '' ) , and developing with the center founded by Marc Augé ( `` Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains '' , the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies ) . \\nSince the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the \\tNorth Atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale . \\nThere has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly \\t, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses . \\nSee \\talso . \\nLists < /doc > < doc id= '' 572 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ?

curid=573 '' title= '' Alchemy '' > Alchemy Alchemy ( from Arabic : `` al-kīmiyā '' \\t; from Ancient Greek : χυμεία , `` khumeía '' ) is an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in China , India , the Muslim world , and Europe . \\nIn its Western form , alchemy is first attested in a number of \\tpseudepigraphical texts written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries AD . \\nAlchemists attempted to purify , mature \\t, and perfect certain materials . \\nCommon aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of `` base metals '' ( e.g. , lead ) into `` noble metals '' ( \\tparticularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease . \\nThe perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from \\tthe alchemical `` magnum opus '' ( `` Great Work '' ) . \\nThe concept of creating the philosophers ' stone \\twas variously connected with all of these projects . \\nIslamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques , theories \\t, and terms , some of which are still in use today . \\nThey did not abandon the Ancient Greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements , and \\tthey tended to guard their work in secrecy , often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism . \\nIn Europe , the 12th-century translations of medieval Islamic works on science and the \\trediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy . \\nThis late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role \\tin the development of early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine ) . \\nModern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , \\tdespite criticisms by scholars such as Eric J. Holmyard and Marie-Louise von Franz that they should be understood as complementary . \\nThe former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences , who examine the subject in terms of early \\tchemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred . \\nThe latter interests historians of esotericism , \\tpsychologists , and some philosophers and spiritualists . \\nThe subject has also made an ongoing \\timpact on literature and the arts . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe word alchemy comes from old French `` alquemie '' \\t, `` alkimie '' , used in Medieval Latin as . \\nThis name was itself adopted from \\tthe Arabic word ( ) . \\nThe Arabic in turn was a borrowing of the Late Greek term `` khēmeía '' ( ) , also spelled `` khumeia \\t'' ( ) and `` khēmía '' ( ) , with `` al- '' being the Arabic definite article 'the ' . \\nTogether this association can be interpreted as 'the process of transmutation by \\twhich to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form ' . \\nSeveral etymologies have been proposed \\tfor the Greek term . \\nThe first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis ( 3rd–4th centuries ) , who \\tderived it from the name of a book , the `` Khemeu . '' \\nHermanm Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from \\tχύμα , used to describe metallic objects formed by casting . \\nOthers trace its roots to the Egyptian name ' ( hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 ' ) , meaning 'black earth ' , \\twhich refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley , as opposed to red desert sand . \\nAccording to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge , the Arabic word `` ʾ '' actually means `` the Egyptian [ science ] '' , borrowing \\tfrom the Coptic word for `` Egypt '' , ' ( or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic , ' ) . \\nThis Coptic word derives from Demotic ' \\t, itself from ancient Egyptian ' . \\nThe ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour `` black '' ( Egypt was the `` black Land '' , by contrast \\twith the `` red Land '' , the surrounding desert ) ; so this etymology could also explain the nickname `` Egyptian black arts '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nAlchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning \\tsome four millennia and three continents . \\nThese traditions ' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it \\thard to trace their mutual influences and `` genetic '' relationships . \\nOne can distinguish at least three major strands , which appear to be mostly independent , at least in their earlier stages : Chinese alchemy , centered in China ; Indian alchemy , centered \\ton the Indian subcontinent ; and Western alchemy , which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from Greco-Roman Egypt to the Islamic world , and finally medieval Europe . \\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism \\tand Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths . \\nIn contrast , Western alchemy developed its philosophical system \\tmostly independent of but influenced by various Western religions . \\nIt is still an open question whether these three strands share a \\tcommon origin , or to what extent they influenced each other . \\nHellenistic \\tEgypt . \\nThe start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt , where the city of Alexandria \\twas a center of alchemical knowledge , and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods . \\nFollowing the work of André-Jean Festugière , modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire \\tas originating from the Egyptian goldsmith 's art , Greek philosophy and different religious traditions . \\nTracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated \\tby the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus . \\nThe treatises of Zosimos of Panopolis , \\tthe earliest historically attested author ( fl . \\nc. 300 CE ) , can \\thelp in situating the other authors . \\nZosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors , such as Mary the Jewess \\t, Pseudo-Democritus , and Agathodaimon , but very little is known about any of these authors . \\nThe most complete of their works , The `` Four Books '' \\tof Pseudo-Democritus , were probably written in the first century AD . \\nRecent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of Zosimus , who \\ttraced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices . \\nIt has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek \\tphilosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way . \\nZosimos of Panopolis wrote in the `` Final Abstinence '' \\t( also known as the `` Final Count '' ) . \\nZosimos explains that the ancient practice of `` tinctures '' ( the technical Greek name for the alchemical arts ) \\thad been taken over by certain `` demons '' who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices . \\nSince Zosimos also called the demons `` the guardians of places '' ( , ) and those who offered them sacrifices `` \\tpriests '' ( , ) , it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests . \\nWhile critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the Egyptian priests and their followers , \\tZosimos nonetheless saw the tradition 's recent past as rooted in the rites of the Egyptian temples . \\nMythology – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt where it was the \\tdomain of the priestly class , though there is little to no evidence for his assertion . \\nAlchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek , Roman , and \\tEgyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation . \\nThese included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets \\t, Isis , Osiris , Jason , and many others . \\nThe central figure in the mythology of alchemy \\tis Hermes Trismegistus ( or Thrice-Great Hermes ) . \\nHis name is derived from the god \\tThoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes . \\nHermes and his caduceus or serpent-staff , \\twere among alchemy 's principal symbols . \\nAccording to Clement of Alexandria , he wrote what were called the \\t`` forty-two books of Hermes '' , covering all fields of knowledge . \\nThe `` Hermetica '' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for \\tWestern alchemical philosophy and practice , called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners . \\nThese writings were collected in the \\tfirst centuries of the common era . \\nTechnology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated \\twith that of metallurgy , extending back to 3500 BC . \\nMany writings were lost when the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of \\talchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ( AD 292 ) . \\nFew original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived , most notable \\tamong them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X . \\nDating from AD 250–300 , they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones \\t, cleaning and fabricating pearls , and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver . \\nThese writings lack the mystical , philosophical elements of alchemy , but do contain the works of Bolus of \\tMendes ( or Pseudo-Democritus ) , which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements . \\nBetween the time of Bolus and Zosimos , the change \\ttook place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art . \\nPhilosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism , \\tPlatonism , Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy 's character . \\nAn important example of alchemy 's roots in Greek philosophy , originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle , was that \\tall things in the universe were formed from only four elements : earth , air , water , and fire . \\nAccording to Aristotle , each element had a sphere to which \\tit belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed . \\nThe four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter , not quantitative , as our modern elements are ; `` ... \\tTrue alchemy never regarded earth , air , water , and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word . \\nThe four elements are simply the primary , and most general , qualities by means of which \\tthe amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form . '' \\nLater alchemists extensively developed the \\tmystical aspects of this concept . \\nAlchemy coexisted alongside \\temerging Christianity . \\nLactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus \\thad prophesied its birth . \\nSt Augustine later affirmed this in the 4th & amp \\t; 5th centuries , but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry . \\nExamples of Pagan , Christian , and Jewish \\talchemists can be found during this period . \\nMost of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms , \\tsuch as Moses , Isis , Cleopatra , Democritus , and Ostanes . \\nOthers authors such as Komarios , and Chymes \\t, we only know through fragments of text . \\nAfter AD 400 , Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves \\tsolely in commenting on the works of these predecessors . \\nBy the middle of the 7th century \\talchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline . \\nIt was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic \\tworld , facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries . \\nByzantium \\t. \\nGreek alchemy is preserved in medieval Greek ( Byzantine ) manuscripts , and yet historians have only relatively \\trecently begun to pay attention to the study and development of Greek alchemy in the Byzantine period . \\nIndia \\t. \\nThe 2nd millennium BC text Vedas describe \\ta connection between eternal life and gold . \\nA considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third-century CE text called Arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives ( Agniyoga ) and salts extracted from fertile \\tsoils and plant remains ( Yavakshara ) such as saltpetre/nitre , perfume making ( different qualities of perfumes are mentioned ) , granulated ( refined ) Sugar . \\nBuddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries \\tmention the transmutation of base metals to gold . \\nAccording to some scholars Greek alchemy may have influenced Indian alchemy \\tbut there are no hard evidences to back this claim . \\nThe 11th-century Persian chemist and physician Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī , who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni , reported that they The goals \\tof alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body ( Sanskrit `` divya-deham '' ) and immortality while still embodied ( Sanskrit `` jīvan-mukti '' ) . \\nSanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur , that are \\thomologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī . \\nSome early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula \\ttantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath . \\nOther early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise `` Kalyāṇakārakam '' \\tof Ugrāditya , written in South India in the early 9th century . \\nTwo famous early Indian alchemical authors \\twere Nāgārjuna Siddha and Nityanātha Siddha . \\nNāgārjuna Siddha was \\ta Buddhist monk . \\nHis book , `` Rasendramangalam '' , is \\tan example of Indian alchemy and medicine . \\nNityanātha Siddha wrote `` Rasaratnākara '' \\t, also a highly influential work . \\nIn Sanskrit , `` rasa '' translates to `` mercury '' , and Nāgārjuna \\tSiddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold . \\nScholarship on Indian alchemy is in the publication of \\t`` The Alchemical Body '' by David Gordon White . \\nA modern bibliography on Indian alchemical \\tstudies has been written by White . \\nThe contents of 39 Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail \\tin G. Jan Meulenbeld 's `` History of Indian Medical Literature '' . \\nThe discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each \\twork , their special features , and where possible the evidence concerning their dating . \\nChapter 13 of HIML , `` Various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra '' ( or `` Various works on \\talchemy and gems '' ) gives brief details of a further 655 ( six hundred and fifty-five ) treatises . \\nIn some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works ; \\tin other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles . \\nA great deal remains to be \\tdiscovered about Indian alchemical literature . \\nThe content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet ( 2014 \\t) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy . \\nIslamic \\tworld . \\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire , the \\tfocus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World . \\nMuch more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented : indeed , most \\tof the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations . \\nThe word `` alchemy '' itself was derived from \\tthe Arabic word `` al-kīmiyā '' ( الكيمياء ) . \\nThe early Islamic world was \\ta melting pot for alchemy . \\nPlatonic and Aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued \\tto be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship . \\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries , the Arabic works attributed to Jābir ibn Hayyān \\t( Latinized as `` Geber '' or `` Geberus '' ) introduced a new approach to alchemy . \\nPaul Kraus , who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir , put \\tit as follows : Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism . \\nThe most influential author in \\tthis regard was arguably Jabir . \\nJabir 's ultimate goal was `` Takwin '' , the artificial creation of life \\tin the alchemical laboratory , up to , and including , human life . \\nHe analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of `` hotness \\t'' , `` coldness '' , `` dryness '' , and `` moistness '' . \\nAccording to Jabir , in each metal two of \\tthese qualities were interior and two were exterior . \\nFor example , lead was externally cold and \\tdry , while gold was hot and moist . \\nThus , Jabir theorized , by rearranging the qualities \\tof one metal , a different metal would result . \\nBy this reasoning , the search for the \\tphilosopher 's stone was introduced to Western alchemy . \\nJabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance 's name in Arabic \\t, when treated with various transformations , held correspondences to the element 's physical properties . \\nThe elemental system used in medieval \\talchemy also originated with Jabir . \\nHis original system consisted of seven elements , which included the five classical elements ( aether , air , earth , fire , and water ) in addition to two chemical elements \\trepresenting the metals : sulphur , `` the stone which burns '' , which characterized the principle of combustibility , and mercury , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties . \\nShortly thereafter , this evolved into eight elements , with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles \\t: sulphur giving flammability or combustion , mercury giving volatility and stability , and salt giving solidity . \\nThe atomic theory of corpuscularianism , where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer \\tof minute particles or corpuscles , also has its origins in the work of Jabir . \\nFrom the 9th to 14th centuries , alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of \\tpractical Muslim chemists , including Alkindus , Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī , Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun . \\nIn particular , they wrote refutations against \\tthe idea of the transmutation of metals . \\nFrom the 14th century onwards , many materials and practices originally belonging to Indian \\talchemy ( Rasayana ) were assimilated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars . \\nEast \\tAsia . \\nResearchers have found evidence that Chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical \\tphenomena that were shared with Arab alchemists during the medieval period . \\nDiscovered in BC China , the `` magic square of three '' was an propagated to \\tfollowers of Abū Mūsā Jābir ibn Ḥayyān at some point over the proceeding several hundred years . \\nOther commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include \\tdiscrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements . \\nThe silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods , ideas , \\tingredients , religion , and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined . \\nWhereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into \\tnoble metals , Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine . \\nThe philosopher 's stone of European alchemists can be compared \\tto the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists . \\nIn the hermetic view , these two goals were not unconnected , and the philosopher 's stone was often equated \\twith the universal panacea ; therefore , the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears . \\nAs early as 317 AD , Ge Hong documented the use \\tof metals , minerals , and elixirs in early Chinese medicine . \\nHong identified three ancient Chinese documents , titled `` Scripture of Great Clarity , Scripture of the Nine \\tElixirs '' , and `` Scripture of the Golden Liquor , '' as texts containing fundamental alchemical information . \\nHe also described alchemy , along with meditation , as the sole \\tspiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend . \\nIn his work `` Inner Chapters of the Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature '' ( 317 AD ) , \\tHong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide . \\nIn the centuries following Ge Hong 's death , the emphasis placed \\ton alchemy as a spiritual practice among Chinese Daoists was reduced . \\nIn 499 AD , Tao Hongjing refuted Hong 's statement that \\talchemy is as important a spiritual practice as Shangqing meditation . \\nWhile Hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection , he ultimately the found \\tthe `` Scripture of the Nine Elixirs '' to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling , aiming to implement more accessible practicing techniques . \\nIn the early 700s , Neidan ( also known as internal alchemy \\t) was adopted by Daoists as a new form of alchemy . \\nNeidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practicing alchemy with compounds found in \\tthe body , rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early Dao alchemy . \\nFor example , saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner \\tgods and did n't require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce . \\nThe inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person , but rather a \\tcollection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region . \\nAlthough those who practiced Neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies , many of the same elixirs \\tand constituents from previous Daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation . \\nEternal life remained a consideration for Neidan alchemists , as it was believed that one would \\tbecome immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfillment . \\nBlack powder may have been an \\timportant invention of Chinese alchemists . \\nIt is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while \\ttrying to find a potion for eternal life . \\nDescribed in 9th-century texts and used in fireworks in China by \\tthe 10th century , it was used in cannons by 1290 . \\nFrom China , the use of gunpowder spread to Japan \\t, the Mongols , the Muslim world , and Europe . \\nGunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in \\t1241 , and in Europe by the 14th century . \\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of \\ttraditional Chinese medicine , such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion . \\nIn the early Song dynasty , followers of this Taoist idea ( chiefly the elite and upper class \\t) would ingest mercuric sulfide , which , though tolerable in low levels , led many to suicide . \\nThinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens , the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew \\tthis method of alchemy in favor of external sources ( the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan , mastering of the qi , etc . ) \\nChinese alchemy was introduced to the \\tWest by Obed Simon Johnson . \\nMedieval \\tEurope . \\nThe introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144 , with the completion \\tof Robert of Chester 's translation of the Arabic `` Book of the Composition of Alchemy '' . \\nAlthough European craftsmen and technicians pre-existed , Robert notes in his preface that alchemy ( though here still referring to \\tthe elixir rather than to the art itself ) was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing . \\nThe translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century Toledo \\t, Spain , through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath . \\nTranslations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum , and \\tthe works of Avicenna and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi . \\nThese brought with them many new words to the European \\tvocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent . \\nAlcohol , carboy , elixir \\t, and athanor are examples . \\nMeanwhile , theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith \\tand experimental rationalism , thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought . \\nThe 11th-century St Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and \\trationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context . \\nIn the early 12th century , Peter Abelard followed Anselm 's work , laying down the \\tfoundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West . \\nIn the early 13th century , Robert Grosseteste used Abelard 's methods of analysis and \\tadded the use of observation , experimentation , and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations . \\nGrosseteste also did much work to \\treconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking . \\nThrough much of the 12th and 13th centuries , alchemical knowledge in Europe \\tremained centered on translations , and new Latin contributions were not made . \\nThe efforts of the translators were \\tsucceeded by that of the encyclopaedists . \\nIn the 13th century , Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were the most notable of \\tthese , their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms . \\nAlbertus Magnus , a Dominican friar , is known to have written works such as the `` Book of Minerals '' where \\the observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time . \\nAlbertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and \\tAvicenna , where they concerned the transmutation of metals . \\nFrom the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century , more than 28 alchemical tracts \\twere misattributed to him , a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist . \\nLikewise , alchemical texts have been attributed \\tto Albert 's student Thomas Aquinas . \\nRoger Bacon , a Franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics , comparative linguistics , and medicine , composed his `` \\tGreat Work '' ( ) for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time . \\nWhile alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic , he did consider \\tit and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy 's connections to soteriology and Christian theology . \\nBacon 's writings integrated morality , salvation , \\talchemy , and the prolongation of life . \\nHis correspondence with Clement highlighted this , noting \\tthe importance of alchemy to the papacy . \\nLike the Greeks before him , Bacon acknowledged the \\tdivision of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres . \\nHe noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle , \\tthe natural philosophers , and all Latin writers of his time . \\nThe practical confirmed the theoretical , and Bacon \\tadvocated its uses in natural science and medicine . \\nIn later European legend , \\the became an archmage . \\nIn particular , along with Albertus Magnus , he was credited with the \\tforging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner 's questions . \\nSoon after Bacon , the influential work of Pseudo-Geber \\t( sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto ) appeared . \\nHis `` Summa Perfectionis '' remained a staple summary of \\talchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods . \\nIt was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury \\ttheory , and the unusual clarity with which they were described . \\nBy the end of the 13th century , alchemy \\thad developed into a fairly structured system of belief . \\nAdepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes , that is to say , they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on \\tthe human body ( for example , if one could learn the secret of purifying gold , one could use the technique to purify the human soul ) . \\nThey believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above , and they had a strong \\ttradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated . \\nFinally , the alchemists practiced their art : they actively experimented with \\tchemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated . \\nTheir entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man 's \\tsoul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam . \\nBy purifying the two parts of man 's \\tsoul , man could be reunited with God . \\nIn the 14th century , alchemy became more accessible to \\tEuropeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars . \\nAlchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to \\tan exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves . \\nDante , Piers Plowman , and Chaucer all painted \\tunflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars . \\nPope John XXII 's 1317 edict , `` Spondent quas non-exhibent \\t'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists . \\nRoman Catholic Inquisitor General Nicholas Eymerich 's `` Directorium Inquisitorum '' , written in 1376 , associated alchemy \\twith the performance of demonic rituals , which Eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture . \\nThis did not , however , lead to any change \\tin the Inquisition 's monitoring or prosecution of alchemists . \\nIn 1403 , Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals ( although it was possible to buy a \\tlicence to attempt to make gold alchemically , and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV ) . \\nThese critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual \\tstudy of alchemy , which continued with an increasingly Christian tone . \\nThe 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus \\t, John of Rupescissa , and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova . \\nNicolas Flamel is a well-known alchemist , but a good example of pseudepigraphy , the \\tpractice of giving your works the name of someone else , usually more famous . \\nAlthough the historical Flamel existed , the writings and \\tlegends assigned to him only appeared in 1612 . \\nFlamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors , and his \\tentire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher 's stone . \\nHis work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions \\t, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations . \\nMost of 'his ' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that \\thad existed before him , especially as regarded the philosopher 's stone . \\nThrough the 14th and 15th centuries , alchemists were much like \\tFlamel : they concentrated on looking for the philosophers ' stone . \\nBernard Trevisan and George \\tRipley made similar contributions . \\nTheir cryptic allusions and symbolism led to \\twide variations in interpretation of the art . \\nRenaissance and early \\tmodern Europe . \\nDuring the Renaissance , Hermetic and Platonic \\tfoundations were restored to European alchemy . \\nThe dawn of medical , pharmaceutical , occult \\t, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed . \\nIn the late 15th century , Marsilio Ficino translated the \\tCorpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin . \\nThese were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had \\ta full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent . \\nRenaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from \\tphysics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel . \\nEsoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism \\t, fusing it with magic , astrology , and Christian cabala . \\nA key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa ( 1486–1535 ) \\t, who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists . \\nIn his `` De Occulta Philosophia '' , he \\tattempted to merge Kabbalah , Hermeticism , and alchemy . \\nHe was instrumental in spreading this new blend \\tof Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy . \\nParacelsus ( Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim , 1493–1541 ) cast alchemy into a \\tnew form , rejecting some of Agrippa 's occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia . \\nParacelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote , `` Many \\thave said of Alchemy , that it is for the making of gold and silver . \\nFor me such is not the aim , but to consider \\tonly what virtue and power may lie in medicines . '' \\nHis hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied \\ton the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm . \\nHe took an approach different from those before him , using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans \\tmust have certain balances of minerals in their bodies , and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them . \\nIatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications \\tof alchemy championed by Paracelsus . \\nJohn Dee ( 13 July 1527 – December \\t, 1608 ) followed Agrippa 's occult tradition . \\nAlthough better known for angel summoning , divination , and his role as astrologer , cryptographer , and consultant to Queen \\tElizabeth I , Dee 's alchemical `` Monas Hieroglyphica '' , written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work . \\nHis writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in \\tline with the Hermetic axiom `` As above so below '' . \\nDuring the 17th century , a short-lived `` supernatural '' interpretation of alchemy became popular \\t, including support by fellows of the Royal Society : Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole . \\nProponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher \\t's stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels . \\nEntrepreneurial opportunities were common for \\tthe alchemists of Renaissance Europe . \\nAlchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining , medical \\tservices , and the production of chemicals , medicines , metals , and gemstones . \\nRudolf II , Holy Roman Emperor , in the late 16th century , famously received and \\tsponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague , including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley . \\nKing James IV of Scotland , Julius , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , Henry V , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , Augustus \\t, Elector of Saxony , Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn , and Maurice , Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists . \\nJohn 's son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia \\tand Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book `` Fasciculus Chemicus '' . \\nAlthough most of these appointments were legitimate , the \\ttrend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance . \\n`` Betrüger '' would use sleight of hand , or \\tclaims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage . \\nLegitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath \\twrote about fraudulent transmutations , distinguishing themselves from the con artists . \\nFalse alchemists were sometimes \\tprosecuted for fraud . \\nThe terms `` chemia '' and `` alchemia '' were used as synonyms in the early modern period , and \\tthe differences between alchemy , chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day . \\nThere were important overlaps between practitioners , and trying to \\tclassify them into alchemists , chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic . \\nFor example , Tycho Brahe ( 1546–1601 ) , an alchemist better known for his \\tastronomical and astrological investigations , had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute . \\nMichael Sendivogius ( `` Michał Sędziwój '' , 1566–1636 ) , a Polish alchemist , philosopher , medical doctor and \\tpioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600 . \\nSendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who , \\tin 1621 , applied this in a submarine . \\nIsaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy ( see \\tIsaac Newton 's occult studies ) than he did to either optics or physics . \\nOther early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other \\tstudies include Robert Boyle , and Jan Baptist van Helmont . \\nTheir Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their \\tpractical achievements in medicine and science . \\nLater modern \\tperiod . \\nThe decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with \\tits emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for `` ancient wisdom '' . \\nAlthough the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century , alchemy still flourished \\tfor some two hundred years , and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century . \\nAs late as 1781 James Price claimed to have produced \\ta powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold . \\nEarly modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories , practices , and purposes : `` Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian , \\tParacelsian and anti-Paracelsian , Hermetic , Neoplatonic , mechanistic , vitalistic , and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof . '' \\nRobert Boyle ( 1627–1691 ) pioneered \\tthe scientific method in chemical investigations . \\nHe assumed nothing in his experiments and \\tcompiled every piece of relevant data . \\nBoyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out , the wind characteristics , the position of \\tthe Sun and Moon , and the barometer reading , all just in case they proved to be relevant . \\nThis approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and \\t19th centuries , based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of Lavoisier and John Dalton . \\nBeginning around 1720 , a rigid distinction began to be drawn for \\tthe first time between `` alchemy '' and `` chemistry '' . \\nBy the 1740s , `` alchemy '' was now restricted to the realm of gold making , leading \\tto the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans , and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud . \\nIn order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected , academic writers during the 18th-century scientific \\tEnlightenment attempted , for the sake of survival , to divorce and separate the `` new '' chemistry from the `` old '' practices of alchemy . \\nThis move was mostly successful , and the consequences of \\tthis continued into the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries . \\nDuring the occult revival of the early 19th century \\t, alchemy received new attention as an occult science . \\nThe esoteric or occultist school , which arose during the 19th century , held ( and continues to hold ) the view that the substances and operations \\tmentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense , and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience . \\nThis interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination , as opposed to the physical manipulation of \\tapparatus and chemicals , and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual , moral or mystical processes . \\nIn the 19th-century revival of alchemy , the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne \\tAtwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy . \\nBoth forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy , as Atwood claimed : `` No modern art \\tor chemistry , notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims , has any thing in common with Alchemy . '' \\nAtwood 's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including \\tEliphas Levi , Arthur Edward Waite , and Rudolf Steiner . \\nHitchcock , in his `` Remarks Upon Alchymists '' ( 1855 ) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim \\tthat the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state . \\nIn 1845 , Baron Carl Reichenbach , published his studies on Odic force , a concept with \\tsome similarities to alchemy , but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion . \\nIn 1946 , Louis Cattiaux published the Message Retrouvé , a work \\tthat was at once philosophical , mystical and highly influenced by alchemy . \\nIn his lineage , many researchers , including Emmanuel and Charles \\td'Hooghvorst , are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium . \\nWomen \\t. \\nSeveral women appear in the \\tearliest history of alchemy . \\nMichael Maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers ' stone \\t: Mary the Jewess , Cleopatra the Alchemist , Medera , and Taphnutia . \\nZosimos ' sister Theosebia ( later known as Euthica the Arab ) \\tand Isis the Prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts . \\nThe first alchemist whose name we know \\twas Mary the Jewess ( ) . \\nEarly sources claim that Mary ( or Maria ) devised a number of \\timprovements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry . \\nHer best known advances were \\tin heating and distillation processes . \\nThe laboratory water-bath , known eponymously ( especially in France ) as the bain-marie \\t, is said to have been invented or at least improved by her . \\nEssentially a double-boiler , it was ( and is ) \\tused in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating . \\nThe tribikos ( a modified distillation apparatus ) and the kerotakis ( a more intricate apparatus used especially \\tfor sublimations ) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her . \\nAlthough we have no writing from Mary herself , she \\tis known from the early-fourth-century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis . \\nAfter the Greco-Roman period , women 's \\tnames appear less frequently in alchemical literature . \\nTowards the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Renaissance , due to the emergence \\tof print , women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries . \\nCaterina Sforza , the Countess of Forlì and Lady of Imola , \\tis one of the few confirmed female alchemists after Mary the Jewess . \\nAs she owned an apothecary , she would practice science \\tand conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories . \\nBeing knowledgable in alchemy and pharmacology , she recorded all of \\ther alchemical ventures in a manuscript named ( 'Experiments ' ) . \\nThe manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes \\tcovering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine . \\nOne of these recipes was \\tfor the water of talc . \\nTalc , which makes up talcum powder , is a mineral which , when combined \\twith water and distilled , was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits . \\nThese supposed benefits included turning \\tsilver to gold and rejuvenation . \\nWhen combined with white wine , its powder \\tform could be ingested to counteract poision . \\nFurthermore , if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine , it was \\tsaid to be a source of protection from any poison , sickness , or plague . \\nOther recipes were for making hair \\tdyes , lotions , lip colors . \\nThere was also information on how to treat a variety \\tof ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer . \\nIn addition , there were instructions on producing the quintessence ( or aether ) , an elixir which \\twas believed to be able to heal all sicknesses , defend against diseases , and perpetuate youthfulness . \\nShe also wrote about creating \\tthe illustrious philosophers ' stone . \\nDue to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works , \\tit is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women . \\nAs the sixteenth century went on , scientific culture \\tflourished and people began collecting `` secrets '' . \\nDuring this period `` secrets '' referred to experiments , and the most coveted ones were not \\tthose which were bizarre , but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome . \\nSome women known for their interest in alchemy were Catherine de ' Medici , the Queen of France , and \\tMarie de ' Medici , the following Queen of France , who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory . \\nAlso , Isabella d'Este , the Marchioness of Mantua \\t, made perfumes herself to serve as gifts . \\nIn this period , the only book of secrets ascribed to a \\twoman was ( 'The Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese ' ) . \\nThis book contained information on how to turn base \\tmetals into gold , medicine , and cosmetics . \\nHowever , it is rumored that a man , Girolamo Ruscelli , was \\tthe real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers . \\nThis contributed to a bigger problem in which male authors would credit prominent \\tnoblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience . \\nFor example , in ( `` Gallant Recipe-Book '' ) , the distillation of \\tlemons and roses was attributed to Elisabetta Gonzaga , the duchess of Urbino . \\nIn the same book , Isabella d'Aragona , the daughter of Alfonso \\tII of Naples , is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury . \\nIppolita Maria Sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript \\tabout a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones . \\nMary Anne Atwood 's `` A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery '' \\t( 1850 ) marks the return of women during the nineteenth-century occult revival . \\nModern historical \\tresearch . \\nThe history of alchemy has become a \\tsignificant and recognized subject of academic study . \\nAs the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history , \\tsuch as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , Rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements . \\nInstitutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University , the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism ( EXESESO ) , \\tthe European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism ( ESSWE ) , and the University of Amsterdam 's Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents . \\nA large collection of books on alchemy is \\tkept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam . \\nA recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features \\tstep by step instructions on turning copper into gold . \\nThe author attributed this recipe to \\tan ancient manuscript he located . \\nJournals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include 'Ambix ' , published by the Society for \\tthe History of Alchemy and Chemistry , and 'Isis ' , published by The History of Science Society . \\nCore \\tconcepts . \\nWestern alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of \\tlate antiquity in which it was born . \\nConcepts were imported from Neoplatonism \\tand earlier Greek cosmology . \\nAs such , the classical elements appear in alchemical writings , as \\tdo the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity . \\nSimilarly , the gods of the Roman pantheon who are \\tassociated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature . \\nThe concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are \\tcentral to the theory of the philosopher 's stone . \\nMagnum \\topus . \\nThe Great Work of Alchemy is often described as \\ta series of four stages represented by colors . \\nModernity \\t. \\nDue to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature , and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the \\tarea of chemistry , the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations . \\nThose focusing on the exoteric , such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. \\tNewman , have interpreted the 'decknamen ' ( or code words ) of alchemy as physical substances . \\nThese scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say \\tare described in medieval and early modern texts . \\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum , focusing on the esoteric , scholars , such as Florin George Călian and Anna Marie \\tRoos , who question the reading of Principe and Newman , interpret these same decknamen as spiritual , religious , or psychological concepts . \\nNew interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated , sometimes merging \\tin concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements . \\nGroups like the Rosicrucians and Freemasons have a \\tcontinued interest in alchemy and its symbolism . \\nSince the Victorian revival of alchemy , `` occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice , involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally \\tor not at all the transformation of laboratory substances '' , which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought . \\nEsoteric interpretations of \\thistorical texts . \\nIn the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric \\tand Neo-Hermeticist practitioners , alchemy is fundamentally spiritual . \\nIn this interpretation , transmutation of lead into gold is presented \\tas an analogy for personal transmutation , purification , and perfection . \\nAccording to this view , early alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis ( ) highlighted the \\tspiritual nature of the alchemical quest , symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul . \\nThis approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages , as metaphysical aspects , substances , physical states , and \\tmaterial processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities , spiritual states , and , ultimately , transformation . \\nIn this sense , the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas ' \\twere like a veil , hiding their true spiritual philosophy . \\nIn the Neo-Hermeticist interpretation , both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect , diseased , corruptible , and \\tephemeral state toward a perfect , healthy , incorruptible , and everlasting state , so the philosopher 's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible . \\nApplied to the alchemist , the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment , \\tand the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal . \\nIn texts that are held to have been written according to this view , the cryptic alchemical symbols , diagrams , and textual imagery of late alchemical works are \\tsupposed to contain multiple layers of meanings , allegories , and references to other equally cryptic works ; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning . \\nIn his 1766 `` Alchemical Catechism '' , Théodore Henri de Tschudi \\tdenotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic : Psychology . \\nAlchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and \\tpopularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung . \\nJung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of `` The Secret of the Golden Flower '' , a Chinese alchemical text translated by his friend \\tRichard Wilhelm , he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner , symbolic images coming up in his patients ' dreams , visions , or fantasies . \\nHe observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of \\ttransformation , a process that Jung called `` individuation . '' \\nSpecifically , he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or Lapis as \\tsymbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this `` process of individuation . '' \\nTogether with his alchemical `` mystica soror '' ( mystical sister ) Jungian Swiss analyst Marie-Louise von Franz , Jung \\tbegan collecting old alchemical texts , compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references , and pored over them . \\nThe volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy 's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as \\ta human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer , spirit and matter are reunited in the `` hieros gamos '' , or divine marriage . \\nHis writings are influential in general psychology , but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the \\timportance of dreams , symbols , and the unconscious archetypal forces ( archetypes ) that comprise all psychic life . \\nBoth von Franz and Jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work \\tof alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture . \\nAmong the volumes Jung wrote on alchemy , his magnum opus is \\tVolume 14 of his Collected Works , `` Mysterium Coniunctionis '' . \\nLiterature \\t. \\nAlchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art , \\tseen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment . \\n`` Literary alchemy '' appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to \\tJ. K. Rowling , and also the popular Japanese manga `` Fullmetal Alchemist '' . \\nHere , characters or plot structure \\tfollow an alchemical magnum opus . \\nIn the 14th century , Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still \\tbe seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir Terry Pratchett . \\nVisual artists had a \\tsimilar relationship with alchemy . \\nWhile some of them used alchemy as a source of satire , others worked \\twith the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work . \\nMusic was also present in the works of \\talchemists and continues to influence popular performers . \\nIn the last hundred years , alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric \\trole in fantasy fiction , film , television , novels , comics and video games . \\nScience \\t. \\nOne goal of alchemy , the transmutation of base substances into gold , is \\tnow known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means . \\nAlthough not financially worthwhile , Gold was synthesized \\tin particle accelerators as early as 1941 . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 579 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=579 ''

title= '' Astronomer '' > Astronomer An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth . \\nThey observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and \\tgalaxies – in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy . \\nExamples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy \\t, the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies . \\nA related but distinct subject is physical cosmology \\t, which studies the Universe as a whole . \\nTypes \\t. \\nAstronomers usually fall under either of two \\tmain types : observational and theoretical . \\nObservational astronomers make direct observations of \\tcelestial objects and analyze the data . \\nIn contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate \\tmodels of things that can not be observed . \\nBecause it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers \\tmust observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die . \\nThey use this data to create models or \\tsimulations to theorize how different celestial objects work . \\nFurther subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include \\tplanetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology . \\nAcademic \\t. \\nHistorically , astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky \\t, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws . \\nToday , that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms \\t`` astronomer '' and `` astrophysicist '' are interchangeable . \\nProfessional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in \\tphysics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities . \\nThey spend the majority of their time working on research , although they quite often have other \\tduties such as teaching , building instruments , or aiding in the operation of an observatory . \\nThe American Astronomical Society , which is the major organization of \\tprofessional astronomers in North America , has approximately 7,000 members . \\nThis number includes scientists from other fields such as physics , geology \\t, and engineering , whose research interests are closely related to astronomy . \\nThe International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 countries who \\tare involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond . \\nContrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night , it is far more common to use a \\tcharge-coupled device ( CCD ) camera to record a long , deep exposure , allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time . \\nBefore CCDs , photographic plates were \\ta common method of observation . \\nModern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes \\tusually just a few weeks per year . \\nAnalysis of observed phenomena , along with making predictions as to the causes \\tof what they observe , takes the majority of observational astronomers ' time . \\nAstronomers who serve as faculty spend much of \\ttheir time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes . \\nMost universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes \\tplanetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field . \\nThose who become astronomers usually have a broad background \\tin maths , sciences and computing in high school . \\nTaking courses that teach how to research , \\twrite , and present papers are also invaluable . \\nIn college/university most astronomers get a \\tPhD in astronomy or physics . \\nAmateur \\tastronomers . \\nWhile there is a relatively low number of professional \\tastronomers , the field is popular among amateurs . \\nMost cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on \\ta regular basis and often host star parties . \\nThe Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world \\t, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations . \\nLike any hobby , most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote \\ta few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research . \\nHowever , amateurs span the range from so-called `` armchair astronomers '' to the very ambitious , who own science-grade \\ttelescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 583 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=583 '' title= '' Ameboid stage '' > Ameboid stage < /doc > < doc id= '' 586 '' url= \\t'' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=586 '' title= '' ASCII '' > ASCII ASCII ( ) , abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange , is a character encoding standard for electronic communication . \\nASCII codes represent text in computers , \\ttelecommunications equipment , and other devices . \\nBecause of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented , ASCII has \\tjust 128 code points , of which only 95 are , which severely limited its scope . \\nAll modern computer systems instead use Unicode , which has millions of code points \\t, but the first 128 of these are the same as the ASCII set . \\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) \\tprefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding . \\nASCII is one of \\tthe IEEE milestones . \\nOverview \\t. \\nASCII was developed \\tfrom telegraph code . \\nIts first commercial use was as a seven-bit \\tteleprinter code promoted by Bell data services . \\nWork on the ASCII standard began in May 1961 , with the first meeting of the American Standards \\tAssociation 's ( ASA ) ( now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI ) X3.2 subcommittee . \\nThe first edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent a \\tmajor revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986 . \\nCompared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more \\tconvenient sorting ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters . \\nThe use of ASCII format for \\tNetwork Interchange was described in 1969 . \\nThat document was formally elevated to \\tan Internet Standard in 2015 . \\nOriginally based on the ( modern ) English alphabet , ASCII encodes 128 \\tspecified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above . \\nNinety-five of the encoded characters are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , lowercase letters \\t`` a '' to `` z '' , uppercase letters `` A '' to `` Z '' , and punctuation symbols . \\nIn addition , the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing control codes which originated with Teletype machines ; most of these are now \\tobsolete , although a few are still commonly used , such as the carriage return , line feed , and tab codes . \\nFor example , lowercase `` i '' would be represented in the ASCII encoding by binary \\t1101001 = hexadecimal 69 ( `` i '' is the ninth letter ) = decimal 105 . \\nDespite being an American standard , ASCII does not have \\ta code point for the cent ( ¢ ) . \\nIt also does not support English terms with diacritical marks such as résumé \\tand jalapeño , or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as Beyoncé . \\nHistory \\t. \\nThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange ( ASCII ) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association ( ASA ) , \\tcalled the X3 committee , by its X3.2 ( later X3L2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittee 's X3.2.4 working group ( now INCITS ) . \\nThe ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute ( USASI \\t) , and ultimately became the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ) . \\nWith the other special characters and control codes filled in , ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963 , leaving \\t28 code positions without any assigned meaning , reserved for future standardization , and one unassigned control code . \\nThere was some debate at the time whether there should \\tbe more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet . \\nThe indecision did not last long : during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to `` \\tsticks '' 6 and 7 , and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard . \\nThe X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the \\tchange to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting . \\nLocating the lowercase letters in `` sticks '' 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from \\tthe upper case by a single bit , which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers . \\nThe X3 committee made other changes , including other new characters ( the brace and vertical bar characters ) , renaming some \\tcontrol characters ( SOM became start of header ( SOH ) ) and moving or removing others ( RU was removed ) . \\nASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967 , then USAS \\tX3.4-1968 , ANSI X3.4-1977 , and finally , ANSI X3.4-1986 . \\nRevisions of the ASCII standard : In the X3.15 standard , the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should \\tbe transmitted ( least significant bit first ) , and how it should be recorded on perforated tape . \\nThey proposed a 9-track standard for magnetic tape , \\tand attempted to deal with some punched card formats . \\nDesign \\tconsiderations . \\nBit \\twidth . \\nThe X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based \\ton the earlier teleprinter encoding systems . \\nLike other character encodings , ASCII specifies a correspondence \\tbetween digital bit patterns and character symbols ( i.e . \\ngraphemes and control \\tcharacters ) . \\nThis allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process \\t, store , and communicate character-oriented information such as written language . \\nBefore ASCII was developed , the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters \\t, 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols . \\nTo include all these , and control characters compatible with the Comité \\tConsultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique ( CCITT ) International Telegraph Alphabet No . \\n2 ( ITA2 ) standard of 1924 , FIELDATA ( 1956 ) , and \\tearly EBCDIC ( 1963 ) , more than 64 codes were required for ASCII . \\nITA2 was in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code \\tthat Émile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874 . \\nThe committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ITA2 ) , \\twhich would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code . \\nIn a shifted code , some character codes determine \\tchoices between options for the following character codes . \\nIt allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission , as an \\terror in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable . \\nThe standards committee decided against shifting , and \\tso ASCII required at least a seven-bit code . \\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code , since eight bits ( octets ) \\twould allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal . \\nHowever , it would require all data transmission \\tto send eight bits when seven could suffice . \\nThe committee voted to use a seven-bit code \\tto minimize costs associated with data transmission . \\nSince perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position \\t, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired . \\nEight-bit machines ( with octets as the native data type ) that \\tdid not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 . \\nInternal \\torganization . \\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together \\tand all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification . \\nThe first two so-called `` ASCII sticks '' ( \\t32 positions ) were reserved for control characters . \\nThe `` space '' character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position \\t20hex ; for the same reason , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . \\nThe committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64-character alphabets , and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced \\teasily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes , as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code ( 1963 ) . \\nLowercase letters were therefore \\tnot interleaved with uppercase . \\nTo keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics , the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters \\t, and the letter `` A '' was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard . \\nThe digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining 4 bits correspond \\tto their respective values in binary , making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward . \\nMany of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters ; an important \\tsubtlety is that these were based on `` mechanical '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . \\nMechanical typewriters followed the de facto \\tstandard set by the Remington No . \\n2 ( 1878 ) , the first typewriter with a shift key , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` O \\t'' ( capital letter `` o '' ) and `` l '' ( lowercase letter `` L '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . \\nThus , in ASCII codice_5 were placed in the second stick , \\tpositions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . \\nThe parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however \\t, because the place corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the space character . \\nThis was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining characters , \\twhich corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` 8 '' and `` 9 '' . \\nThis discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards , notably the Teletype Model 33 , \\twhich used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII , differently from traditional mechanical typewriters . \\nElectric typewriters , notably the IBM Selectric ( 1961 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the IBM PC ( 1981 \\t) , especially Model M ( 1984 ) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did . \\nThe codice_7 pair also \\tdates to the No . \\n2 , and the codice_8 pairs were used on \\tsome keyboards ( others , including the No . \\n2 , did not shift codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( full \\tstop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting ) . \\nHowever , ASCII split the codice_11 \\tpair ( dating to No . \\n2 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( \\tvaried conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 . \\nSome then-common typewriter characters were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as diacritics for international use , \\tand codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the simple line characters codice_17 ( in addition to common codice_18 ) . \\nThe `` @ '' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented `` \\tÀ '' in the French variation , so the `` @ '' was placed in position 40hex , right before the letter A . \\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message ( SOM ) , end of address ( EOA \\t) , end of message ( EOM ) , end of transmission ( EOT ) , `` who are you ? '' \\n( WRU ) , \\t`` are you ? '' \\n( RU ) , a reserved device control ( DC0 ) , \\tsynchronous idle ( SYNC ) , and acknowledge ( ACK ) . \\nThese were positioned to maximize the \\tHamming distance between their bit patterns . \\nCharacter \\torder . \\nASCII-code order is also called \\t`` ASCIIbetical '' order . \\nCollation of data is sometimes done in this order rather \\tthan `` standard '' alphabetical order ( collating sequence ) . \\nThe main deviations in ASCII order are : An intermediate \\torder converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values . \\nCharacter \\tgroups . \\nControl \\tcharacters . \\nASCII reserves the first 32 codes ( numbers 0–31 decimal ) for control characters : codes originally intended not to represent printable information , but rather to \\tcontrol devices ( such as printers ) that make use of ASCII , or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape . \\nFor example , character 10 represents the `` line feed '' function ( which causes \\ta printer to advance its paper ) , and character 8 represents `` backspace '' . \\nrefers to control characters that do not include carriage return \\t, line feed or white space as non-whitespace control characters . \\nExcept for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting , ASCII does not \\tdefine any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document . \\nOther schemes , such as markup languages , \\taddress page and document layout and formatting . \\nThe original ASCII standard used only short \\tdescriptive phrases for each control character . \\nThe ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal \\tlink than on a data stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the meaning of `` delete '' . \\nProbably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model \\t33 ASR , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader/punch option . \\nPaper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the \\t1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape . \\nIn particular , the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ( control-Q , DC1 , also known as XON ) \\t, 19 ( control-S , DC3 , also known as XOFF ) , and 127 ( delete ) became de facto standards . \\nThe Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-G ( code 7 , BEL , meaning audibly alert \\tthe operator ) literally , as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character . \\nBecause the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol ( from ASCII-1963 , which had this character instead of underscore ) , a noncompliant use \\tof code 15 ( control-O , shift in ) interpreted as `` delete previous character '' was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected . \\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-S ( XOFF , an abbreviation for transmit off ) \\t, it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control-Q ( XON , transmit on ) caused the tape reader to resume . \\nThis so-called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a `` handshaking '' signal warning a sender to \\tstop transmission because of impending buffer overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique . \\nOn some systems , control-S retains its meaning but control-Q \\tis replaced by a second control-S to resume output . \\nThe 33 ASR also could be configured to employ control-R ( DC2 ) and control-T ( DC4 ) to start and stop the tape punch \\t; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively . \\nDelete vs \\tbackspace . \\nThe Teletype could not move its typehead backwards , so it did not \\thave a key on its keyboard to send a BS ( backspace ) . \\nInstead , there was a key marked \\tthat sent code 127 ( DEL ) . \\nThe purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually-input paper tape : the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to \\tback it up , then type the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored . \\nTeletypes were commonly used with the less-expensive computers from Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) ; these systems had \\tto use what keys were available , and thus the DEL code was assigned to erase the previous character . \\nBecause of this , DEC video terminals ( by default ) sent the DEL code for the key marked `` Backspace '' while the \\tseparate key marked `` Delete '' sent an escape sequence ; many other competing terminals sent a BS code for the backspace key . \\nThe Unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character , this could be set to BS `` or '' DEL , but not both , resulting in recurring situations \\tof ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ( shells that allow line editing , such as ksh , bash , and zsh , understand both ) . \\nThe assumption that no key sent a BS code allowed control+H to be used for \\tother purposes , such as the `` help '' prefix command in GNU Emacs . \\nEscape \\t. \\nMany more of the control codes have been \\tassigned meanings quite different from their original ones . \\nThe `` escape '' character ( ESC , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to \\tallow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning , an `` escape sequence '' . \\nThis is the same meaning of `` escape '' encountered in URL encodings , \\tC language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . \\nOver time this interpretation has been \\tco-opted and has eventually been changed . \\nIn modern usage , an ESC sent `` to '' the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called `` ANSI escape code '' ( or \\t, more properly , a `` Control Sequence Introducer '' ) from ECMA-48 ( 1972 ) and its successors , beginning with ESC followed by a `` [ `` ( left-bracket ) character . \\nIn contrast , an ESC sent `` from '' the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band \\tcharacter used to terminate an operation or special mode , as in the TECO and vi text editors . \\nIn graphical user interface ( GUI ) and windowing systems , ESC generally causes \\tan application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether . \\nEnd of \\tline . \\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage \\t, created problems when transferring `` plain text '' files between systems . \\nThe best example of this is the \\tnewline problem on various operating systems . \\nTeletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both `` carriage return '' ( which moves the printhead to the \\tbeginning of the line ) and `` line feed '' ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) . \\nThe name `` carriage return '' comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter \\tthe carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary . \\nThe entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the \\tright in order to position the paper for the next line . \\nDEC operating systems ( OS/8 , RT-11 , \\tRSX-11 , RSTS , TOPS-10 , etc . ) \\nused both characters to mark the end of a line so \\tthat the console device ( originally Teletype machines ) would work . \\nBy the time so-called `` glass TTYs '' ( later called CRTs or `` dumb terminals '' ) \\tcame along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it . \\nWhen Gary Kildall created CP/M , he was inspired by some of \\tthe command line interface conventions used in DEC 's RT-11 operating system . \\nUntil the introduction of PC DOS in 1981 , IBM had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC encoding instead of \\tASCII , and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of `` carriage return '' was meaningless . \\nIBM 's PC DOS ( also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft ) inherited the convention by \\tvirtue of being loosely based on CP/M , and Windows in turn inherited it from MS-DOS . \\nRequiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity \\tand ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself . \\nTo simplify matters , plain text data streams , including files , on \\tMultics used line feed ( LF ) alone as a line terminator . \\nUnix and Unix-like systems , and Amiga \\tsystems , adopted this convention from Multics . \\nOn the other hand , the original Macintosh OS , Apple DOS , and ProDOS used carriage return ( CR ) alone as a line terminator ; however \\t, since Apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the Unix-based macOS operating system , they now use line feed ( LF ) as well . \\nThe Radio Shack TRS-80 also used \\ta lone CR to terminate lines . \\nComputers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and TENEX using CR-LF line endings ; machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings \\t; and machines running operating systems such as OS/360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used EBCDIC rather than ASCII encoding . \\nThe Telnet protocol defined an ASCII `` Network Virtual Terminal '' ( NVT ) , so that connections between hosts \\twith different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network . \\nTelnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings , and software using \\tother conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT . \\nThe File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol , including use of the Network Virtual \\tTerminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode . \\nThis adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to other network protocols , such as those used \\tfor E-mail and the World Wide Web , on systems not using the NVT 's CR-LF line-ending convention . \\nEnd of \\tfile/stream . \\nThe PDP-6 monitor , and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10 , used control-Z \\t( SUB ) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal . \\nSome operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks \\t, and used control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file . \\nFor these reasons , EOF , or end-of-file , was used colloquially \\tand conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-Z instead of SUBstitute . \\nThe end-of-text code ( ETX ) , also known as control-C , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using Z as the control \\tcode to end a file is analogous to its position at the end of the alphabet , and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid . \\nA historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt \\tand halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard . \\nIn C library and Unix conventions , the null character is used to terminate text strings ; such null-terminated \\tstrings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ , where here Z stands for `` zero '' . \\nControl code \\tchart . \\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment , \\tfor example ISO 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers . \\nPrintable \\tcharacters . \\nCodes 20hex to 7Ehex , known as the printable characters , represent \\tletters , digits , punctuation marks , and a few miscellaneous symbols . \\nThere are 95 printable \\tcharacters in total . \\nCode 20hex , the `` space '' character , denotes the space \\tbetween words , as produced by the space bar of a keyboard . \\nSince the space character is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than a control character \\t) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section . \\nCode 7Fhex corresponds to the non-printable `` delete '' ( DEL ) control character and is \\ttherefore omitted from this chart ; it is covered in the previous section 's chart . \\nEarlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret ( 5Ehex \\t) and the left arrow instead of the underscore ( 5Fhex ) . ] ] \\nUsage \\t. \\nASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for \\tAmerican Telephone & amp ; Telegraph 's TWX ( TeletypeWriter eXchange ) network . \\nTWX originally used the earlier five-bit ITA2 , which \\twas also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system . \\nBob Bemer introduced features such \\tas the escape sequence . \\nHis British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer , `` so much so \\tthat the code that was to become ASCII was first called the `` Bemer–Ross Code '' in Europe '' . \\nBecause of his extensive work on ASCII , Bemer \\thas been called `` the father of ASCII '' . \\nOn March 11 , 1968 , US President Lyndon B. Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States Federal Government support ASCII , stating : I have also approved recommendations of \\tthe Secretary of Commerce [ Luther H. Hodges ] regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations . \\nAll computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to \\tuse the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used . \\nASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December \\t2007 , when UTF-8 encoding surpassed it ; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII . \\nVariants and \\tderivations . \\nAs computer technology spread throughout the world , different standards bodies and corporations developed many \\tvariations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets . \\nOne could class some of these variations as `` ASCII extensions '' , although some misuse that term \\tto represent all variants , including those that do not preserve ASCII 's character-map in the 7-bit range . \\nFurthermore , the ASCII extensions have \\talso been mislabelled as ASCII . \\n7-bit \\tcodes . \\nFrom early in its development , ASCII was intended to be just \\tone of several national variants of an international character code standard . \\nOther international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 ( 1967 ) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII , with extensions for characters \\toutside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States , such as the symbol for the United Kingdom 's pound sterling ( £ ) ; e.g . \\nwith code \\tpage 1104 . \\nAlmost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII , since ASCII \\tsuited the needs of only the US and a few other countries . \\nFor example , Canada had its \\town version that supported French characters . \\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII \\tto include non-English letters ( e.g . \\né , ñ , ß , Ł \\t) , currency symbols ( e.g . \\n£ , ¥ \\t) , etc . \\nSee also YUSCII \\t( Yugoslavia ) . \\nIt would share most characters in common , but assign other locally \\tuseful characters to several code points reserved for `` national use '' . \\nHowever , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO 's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII 's choices for the national use \\tcharacters to seem to be de facto standards for the world , causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points . \\nISO/IEC 646 , like ASCII , \\tis a 7-bit character set . \\nIt does not make any additional codes available , so \\tthe same code points encoded different characters in different countries . \\nEscape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text , but they were rarely used , so it was often impossible to know \\twhat variant to work with and , therefore , which character a code represented , and in general , text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway . \\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to `` national use '' code points that were used \\tfor accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646 , a German , French , or Swedish , etc . \\nprogrammer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646 , rather than ASCII , had to write , and , thus , read , something such as \\tinstead of C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . \\nMany programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII , \\tso plain-text in Swedish , German etc . \\n( for example , in e-mail or Usenet ) contained `` { , } '' \\tand similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to . \\nFor example , a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get `` N { jag har sm|rg \\t} sar '' as the answer , which should be `` Nä jag har smörgåsar '' meaning `` No I 've got sandwiches '' . \\nIn Japan and Korea , still a variation of ASCII is used , in which the backslash ( 5C hex ) is \\trendered as ¥ ( a Yen sign , in Japan ) or ₩ ( a Won sign , in Korea ) . \\nThis means that , for example , the file path C : \\\\Users\\\\Smith is shown as \\tC : ¥Users¥Smith ( in Japan ) or C : ₩Users₩Smith ( in Korea ) . \\n8-bit \\tcodes . \\nEventually , as 8- , 16- , and 32-bit ( and later 64-bit ) computers began to replace 12- , 18- , and 36-bit computers as the \\tnorm , it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory , providing an opportunity for extended , 8-bit relatives of ASCII . \\nIn most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII , leaving the original character-mapping intact \\t, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) characters . \\nEncodings include ISCII ( India ) \\t, VISCII ( Vietnam ) . \\nAlthough these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII , \\ttrue ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard . \\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and \\toften filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics . \\nKaypro CP/M computers used the `` upper \\t'' 128 characters for the Greek alphabet . \\nThe PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based \\ton ASCII-1963 , instead of the more common ASCII-1967 , such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer . \\nAtari 8-bit computers and Galaksija \\tcomputers also used ASCII variants . \\nThe IBM PC defined code page 437 , which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols \\tsuch as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . \\nOperating systems such as DOS supported these code pages , \\tand manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware . \\nDigital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set ( DEC-MCS ) for use in the popular VT220 \\tterminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . \\nThe Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set , both of these contained \\tboth international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets . \\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard ( derived from the DEC-MCS ) finally provided a standard that most systems \\tcopied ( at least as accurately as they copied ASCII , but with many substitutions ) . \\nA popular further extension designed by Microsoft , Windows-1252 ( often mislabeled as \\tISO-8859-1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing . \\nISO-8859-1 , Windows-1252 , and the original 7-bit ASCII were the \\tmost common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common . \\nISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range , \\tas part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system . \\nUnicode \\t. \\nUnicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set ( UCS ) have a much wider array of characters \\tand their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments . \\nWhile ASCII is limited to 128 characters , Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using natural numbers called `` \\tcode points '' ) and encoding ( to 8- , 16- , or 32-bit binary formats , called UTF-8 , UTF-16 , and UTF-32 , respectively ) . \\nASCII was incorporated into the Unicode ( 1991 ) character set as the first 128 \\tsymbols , so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets . \\nThis allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII , as a UTF-8 file containing \\tonly ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters . \\nEven more importantly , forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with \\tthe highest bit set ( as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1 ) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 589 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=589 '' title= '' Ashmore And Cartier Islands '' > Ashmore And Cartier Islands < /doc > < doc \\tid= ''

to appear as moving images . \\nIn traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand \\ton transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . \\nToday , most animations are made \\twith computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) . \\nComputer animation can be very detailed 3D animation , while 2D computer animation ( which may have the look \\tof traditional animation ) can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth , or faster real-time renderings . \\nOther common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and \\tthree-dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets , or clay figures . \\nA cartoon is an animated film , usually a \\tshort film , featuring an exaggerated visual style . \\nThe style takes inspiration from comic strips , often featuring anthropomorphic \\tanimals , superheroes , or the adventures of human protagonists . \\nEspecially with animals that form a \\tnatural predator/prey relationship ( e.g . \\ncats and mice , coyotes and birds ) , the action often centers on violent pratfalls \\tsuch as falls , collisions , and explosions that would be lethal in real life . \\nThe illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and \\tlater to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement , but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain . \\nThe illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally \\tdiffer from each other , with unnoticeable interruptions , is a stroboscopic effect . \\nWhile animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a \\tseparate background , computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment . \\nAnalog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images

. \\nFor display on computers , technology such as \\tthe animated GIF and Flash animation were developed . \\nIn addition to short films , feature films , television series , animated GIFs , and other media dedicated to the display \\tof moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces , and visual effects . \\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance \\tmoving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation . \\nThe mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate \\tliving beings has a very long history in automata . \\nElectronic automata were popularized \\tby Disney as animatronics . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe word `` animation '' stems from the Latin `` animātiōn '' , \\tstem of `` animātiō '' , meaning `` a bestowing of life '' . \\nThe primary meaning of the English word is `` liveliness '' and has been \\tin use much longer than the meaning of `` moving image medium '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nBefore \\tcinematography . \\nHundreds of years before the introduction of true animation , people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving \\tfigures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry , automata , shadow play , and the magic lantern . \\nThe multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in European theatres from the late 18th century through the first \\thalf of the 19th century , featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion . \\nIn 1833 , the stroboscopic disc ( better known as the phénakisticope ) introduced the principle of modern animation with \\tsequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures . \\nSeries of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years , but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to \\trepresent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements . \\nThe stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope ( 1866 ) \\t, the flip book ( 1868 ) and the praxinoscope ( 1877 ) . \\nA typical 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were \\tdisplayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually . \\nThe flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end \\t, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds . \\nThe first to create much longer sequences seems to have been Charles-Émile Reynaud , who between \\t1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long `` Pantomimes Lumineuses '' . \\nSilent \\tera . \\nWhen cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades , \\tthe wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment . \\nAnimation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys , with chromolithography film \\tloops ( often traced from live-action footage ) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home . \\nIt would take some more years \\tbefore animation reached movie theaters . \\nAfter earlier experiments by movie pioneers J. Stuart Blackton , Arthur Melbourne-Cooper , Segundo de Chomón , and Edwin S. Porter ( among others ) , Blackton 's `` The Haunted Hotel '' \\t( 1907 ) was the first huge stop motion success , baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail , without signs of any known stage trick . \\nÉmile Cohl 's `` Fantasmagorie '' ( 1908 ) is the oldest known example of a \\tstandard cinematographic film composed entirely of what became known as traditional ( hand-drawn ) animation . \\nOther great artistic and very influential short films were created by Ladislas Starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by Winsor McCay with \\tdetailed drawn animation in films such as `` Little Nemo '' ( 1911 ) and `` Gertie the Dinosaur '' ( 1914 ) . \\nDuring the 1910s , the production of animated `` \\tcartoons '' became an industry in the US . \\nSuccessful producer John Randolph Bray and animator Earl Hurd , patented the cel \\tanimation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century . \\nFelix the Cat , who debuted in 1919 , became the first \\tfully realized animal character in the history of American film animation . \\nAmerican golden \\tage . \\nIn 1928 , `` Steamboat Willie '' , featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse , popularized film \\twith synchronized sound and put Walt Disney 's studio at the forefront of the animation industry . \\nAlthough Disney Animation 's actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very \\tsmall , the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the `` aesthetic norms '' of animation ever since . \\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of \\tthe golden age of American animation that would last until the 1960s . \\nThe United States dominated the world market of \\tanimation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts . \\nSeveral studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers , including Walt Disney Productions ' Goofy ( 1932 ) and Donald Duck ( 1934 ) , Warner Bros. Cartoons ' Looney Tunes characters like Porky Pig ( 1935 ) , Daffy Duck ( 1937 ) , Bugs Bunny ( 1938–1940 ) , Tweety ( 1941–1942 ) , Sylvester the Cat ( 1945 ) , Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner ( 1949 ) , Fleischer Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios \\t' Betty Boop ( 1930 ) , Popeye ( 1933 ) , Superman ( 1941 ) and Casper ( 1945 ) , MGM cartoon studio 's Tom and Jerry ( 1940 ) and Droopy , Walter Lantz Productions/Universal Studio Cartoons ' Woody Woodpecker ( 1940 ) , Terrytoons/20th Century Fox 's Gandy Goose ( 1938 ) , Dinky Duck ( 1939 ) , Mighty Mouse ( 1942 ) and Heckle and Jeckle ( 1946 ) and United Artists ' Pink Panther ( 1963 ) . \\nFeatures before \\tCGI . \\nIn 1917 , Italian-Argentine director Quirino Cristiani made the first feature-length film `` El \\tApóstol '' ( now lost ) , which became a critical and commercial success . \\nIt was followed by Cristiani 's `` Sin dejar rastros '' in 1918 , \\tbut one day after its premiere , the film was confiscated by the government . \\nAfter working on it for three years , Lotte Reiniger released the German feature-length silhouette animation \\t`` Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed '' in 1926 , the oldest extant animated feature . \\nIn 1937 , Walt Disney Studios premiered their first animated feature , `` Snow White \\tand the Seven Dwarfs '' , still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features . \\nThe Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with \\t`` Gulliver 's Travels '' with some success . \\nPartly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War , Disney 's next features `` Pinocchio '' , `` Fantasia '' ( \\tboth 1940 ) and Fleischer Studios ' second animated feature `` Mr. Bug Goes to Town '' ( 1941–1942 ) failed at the box office . \\nFor decades afterward , Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features \\t, until Ralph Bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features . \\nSullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting \\twith `` An American Tail '' in 1986 . \\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney 's features , other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both \\tshort and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles , relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques . \\nRussia 's Soyuzmultfilm animation studio , founded in 1936 , produced 20 films ( \\tincluding shorts ) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018 . \\nChina , Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic , Italy , France , and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films \\t, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production , with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation . \\nTelevision \\t. \\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s , when \\ttelevision sets started to become common in most developed countries . \\nCartoons were mainly programmed for children , on convenient time slots \\t, and especially US youth spent many hours watching Saturday-morning cartoons . \\nMany classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the \\t1950s , the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series . \\nHanna-Barbera Productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series , such as `` The Flintstones '' ( 1960–1966 ) ( the first \\tprime time animated series ) , `` Scooby-Doo '' ( since 1969 ) and Belgian co-production `` The Smurfs '' ( 1981–1989 ) . \\nThe constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity \\tresulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts . \\nQuality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such \\tas `` The Simpsons '' ( since 1989 ) as part of a `` renaissance '' of American animation . \\nWhile US animated series also spawned successes internationally , many other countries produced their \\town child-oriented programming , relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation . \\nJapanese anime TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s , and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios , resulting in hit series such as `` Barbapapa \\t'' ( The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977 ) , `` Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ ( Vicky the Viking ) '' ( Austria/Germany/Japan 1974 ) , and `` The Jungle Book '' ( Italy/Japan 1989 ) . \\nSwitch from cels \\tto computers . \\nComputer animation was gradually \\tdeveloped since the 1940s . \\n3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s , with an \\tearly ( short ) appearance in the sci-fi thriller `` Futureworld '' ( 1976 ) . \\n`` The Rescuers Down Under '' was the first feature \\tfilm to be completely created digitally without a camera . \\nIt was produced in a style that 's very similar to traditional cel animation on the Computer Animation Production \\tSystem ( CAPS ) , developed by The Walt Disney Company in collaboration with Pixar in the late 1980s . \\nThe so-called 3D style , more often associated with computer animation , became the dominant technique following the release \\tof Pixar 's `` Toy Story '' ( 1995 ) , the first computer-animated feature in this style . \\nMost of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated \\tfilms around the 1990s , as it proved cheaper and more profitable . \\nNot only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers , but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted \\tappearance , in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software , while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects . \\nEconomic \\tstatus . \\nIn 2010 , the animation market was estimated \\tto be worth circa US $ 80 billion . \\nBy 2020 , the value had increased \\tto an estimated US $ 270 billion . \\nAnimated feature-length films returned the highest gross margins ( around 52 \\t% ) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013 . \\nAnimation as an art and industry continues \\tto thrive as of the early 2020s . \\nEducation , propaganda \\tand commercials . \\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction , while its total malleability \\talso allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality . \\nIt has therefore been widely used \\tfor other purposes than mere entertainment . \\nDuring World War II , animation \\twas widely exploited for propaganda . \\nMany American studios , including Warner Bros. and Disney , lent their talents \\tand their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values . \\nSome countries , including China , Japan and the United Kingdom \\t, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts . \\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials , both due \\tto its graphic appeal , and the humour it can provide . \\nSome animated characters in commercials have survived for decades , such as \\tSnap , Crackle and Pop in advertisements for Kellogg 's cereals . \\nTex Avery was the producer of the first Raid `` Kills Bugs Dead \\t'' commercials in 1966 , which were very successful for the company . \\nOther media , merchandise \\tand theme parks . \\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series , many cartoon characters would \\talso prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media . \\nAnimation has traditionally been very \\tclosely related to comic books . \\nWhile many comic book characters found their way to the screen ( which is often the case in Japan , \\twhere many manga are adapted into anime ) , original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines . \\nSomewhat similarly , characters and plots for video games ( an interactive \\tanimation medium ) have been derived from films and vice versa . \\nSome of the original content produced for the screen \\tcan be used and marketed in other media . \\nStories and images can easily be adapted into \\tchildren 's books and other printed media . \\nSongs and music have appeared on \\trecords and as streaming media . \\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media \\t, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example . \\nSince first being licensed for a children 's writing tablet in 1929 , their Mickey Mouse mascot \\thas been depicted on an enormous amount of products , as have many other Disney characters . \\nThis may have influenced some pejorative use of Mickey 's name , but licensed Disney products sell well , \\tand the so-called Disneyana has many avid collectors , and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub ( since 1984 ) . \\nDisneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions \\tthat were based on Disney 's cartoon characters . \\nIts enormous success spawned several other \\tDisney theme parks and resorts . \\nDisney 's earnings from the theme parks have relatively \\toften been higher than those from their movies . \\nCriticism \\t. \\nCriticism of animation has been common in \\tmedia and cinema since its inception . \\nWith its popularity , a large amount of \\tcriticism has arisen , especially animated feature-length films . \\nCriticisms regarding cultural representation and psychological effects on children have been raised around the animation industry \\t, which some claim has remained politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture . \\nAwards \\t. \\nAs with any other form of media , animation \\thas instituted awards for excellence in the field . \\nMany are part of general or regional film award programs , like the \\tChina 's Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation ( since 1981 ) . \\nAwards programs dedicated to animation , with many categories , include ASIFA-Hollywood 's Annie \\tAwards , the Emile Awards in Europe and the Anima Mundi awards in Brazil . \\nAcademy \\tAwards . \\nApart from Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film ( since 1932 ) and Best Animated Feature ( since 2002 ) , \\tanimated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories , relatively often for Best Original Song and Best Original Score . \\n`` Beauty and the Beast '' was the first \\tanimated film nominated for Best Picture , in 1991 . \\n`` Up '' ( 2009 ) and `` Toy Story 3 '' ( 2010 ) also received \\tBest Picture nominations , after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten . \\nProduction \\t. \\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than a few seconds \\t) has developed as a form of filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . \\nTraits common to both live-action and animated feature-length \\tfilms are labor intensity and high production costs . \\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase , \\tthe marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films . \\nIt is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live-action film , but every take on an animated \\tfilm must be manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation ) . \\nIt is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating \\ta visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film . \\nThus , animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards \\t, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole . \\nWhile live-action films are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more \\tlatitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , real-time improvisation ) . \\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film 's consistency from \\tstart to finish , even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger . \\nAnimators , like all artists , necessarily have individual styles , but must subordinate their \\tindividuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film . \\nSince the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 people , of \\twhom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated films . \\nIt is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their \\tstyles ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult . \\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists \\tdevelop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins . \\nCharacter designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look \\tlike with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . \\nOn traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further \\thelp the animators see how characters would look from different angles . \\nUnlike live-action films , animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the \\tstoryboard format ; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film . \\nIn the early 1960s , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays ( while also continuing \\tto use story departments ) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s . \\nTechniques \\t. \\nTraditional \\t. \\nTraditional animation ( also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation ) was \\tthe process used for most animated films of the 20th century . \\nThe individual frames of a traditionally animated film are \\tphotographs of drawings , first drawn on paper . \\nTo create the illusion of movement , each \\tdrawing differs slightly from the one before it . \\nThe animators ' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels , which are \\tfilled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings . \\nThe completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted \\tbackground by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film . \\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete \\tby the beginning of the 21st century . \\nToday , animators ' drawings and the backgrounds are either \\tscanned into or drawn directly into a computer system . \\nVarious software programs are used to color the \\tdrawings and simulate camera movement and effects . \\nThe final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media \\t, including traditional 35 mm film and newer media with digital video . \\nThe `` look '' of traditional cel animation is still preserved , and the \\tcharacter animators ' work has remained essentially the same over the past 90 years . \\nSome animation producers have used the term `` tradigital '' ( a play on the words `` \\ttraditional '' and `` digital '' ) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology . \\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include `` Pinocchio '' ( United States , 1940 ) , `` Animal Farm '' ( United Kingdom , \\t1954 ) , `` Lucky and Zorba '' ( Italy , 1998 ) , and `` The Illusionist '' ( British-French , 2010 ) . \\nTraditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include `` The Lion King '' ( US , 1994 ) , `` The Prince of Egypt '' ( US , 1998 ) , `` Akira '' ( Japan \\t, 1988 ) , `` Spirited Away '' ( Japan , 2001 ) , `` The Triplets of Belleville '' ( France , 2003 ) , and `` The Secret of Kells '' ( Irish-French-Belgian , 2009 ) . \\nFull \\t. \\nFull animation is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that \\tregularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement , having a smooth animation . \\nFully animated films can be made in a variety of styles , from more realistically animated works like those produced by the Walt Disney studio ( `` The Little Mermaid '' \\t, `` Beauty and the Beast '' , `` Aladdin '' , `` The Lion King '' ) to the more 'cartoon ' styles of the Warner Bros. animation studio . \\nMany of the Disney animated features are examples of full animation , as are non-Disney works , `` The Secret of NIMH '' ( US \\t, 1982 ) , `` The Iron Giant '' ( US , 1999 ) , and `` Nocturna '' ( Spain , 2007 ) . \\nFully animated films are often animated on `` twos '' , sometimes on `` ones '' \\t, which means that 12 to 24 drawings are required for a single second of film . \\nLimited \\t. \\nLimited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and \\tmethods of movement usually a choppy or `` skippy '' movement animation . \\nLimited animation uses fewer drawings per second , \\tthereby limiting the fluidity of the animation . \\nThis is a \\tmore economic technique . \\nPioneered by the artists at the American studio United Productions of America , limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression , as \\tin `` Gerald McBoing-Boing '' ( US , 1951 ) , `` Yellow Submarine '' ( UK , 1968 ) , and certain anime produced in Japan . \\nIts primary use , however , has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television ( the work \\tof Hanna-Barbera , Filmation , and other TV animation studios ) and later the Internet ( web cartoons ) . \\nRotoscoping \\t. \\nRotoscoping is a technique patented by Max Fleischer in 1917 \\twhere animators trace live-action movement , frame by frame . \\nThe source film can be directly copied from actors ' outlines into animated drawings , as in `` The Lord of the Rings '' ( US , 1978 ) , or \\tused in a stylized and expressive manner , as in `` Waking Life '' ( US , 2001 ) and `` A Scanner Darkly '' ( US , 2006 ) . \\nSome other examples are `` Fire and Ice '' ( US , 1983 ) , `` Heavy \\tMetal '' ( 1981 ) , and `` Aku no Hana '' ( Japan , 2013 ) . \\nLive-action \\tblending . \\nLive-action/animation is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live \\taction shots or live-action actors into animated shots . \\nOne of the earlier uses was in Koko the \\tClown when Koko was drawn over live-action footage . \\nWalt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of `` Alice Comedies '' \\t( 1923–1927 ) , in which a live-action girl enters an animated world . \\nOther examples include `` Allegro Non Troppo '' ( Italy , 1976 ) , `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit '' ( US , 1988 ) , `` \\tVolere volare '' ( Italy 1991 ) , `` Space Jam '' ( US , 1996 ) and `` Osmosis Jones '' ( US , 2001 ) . \\nStop \\tmotion . \\nStop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing \\tthem one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement . \\nThere are many different types of stop-motion animation , usually \\tnamed after the medium used to create the animation . \\nComputer software is widely available to create this type of animation ; traditional stop-motion \\tanimation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation . \\nComputer \\t. \\nComputer animation encompasses a variety of techniques , the unifying factor \\tbeing that the animation is created digitally on a computer . \\n2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques \\tusually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact . \\n3D animation can create images that \\tseem real to the viewer . \\n2D \\t. \\n2D animation figures are created or edited on the \\tcomputer using 2D bitmap graphics and 2D vector graphics . \\nThis includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques \\t, interpolated morphing , onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping . \\n2D animation has many applications , including analog computer \\tanimation , Flash animation , and PowerPoint animation . \\nCinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an \\tanimated GIF file of which part is animated . \\nFinal line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation , to give artists and animators \\tmore influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department . \\nSpeaking about using this approach in `` Paperman '' , John Kahrs said that `` Our animators can change things \\t, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the arm . '' \\n3D \\t. \\n3D animation is digitally modeled \\tand manipulated by an animator . \\nThe 3D model maker usually starts by creating a \\t3D polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate . \\nA mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces , \\twhich give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment . \\nSometimes , the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an \\tarmature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices . \\nThis process is called rigging and can be used \\tin conjunction with key frames to create movement . \\nOther techniques can be applied , mathematical functions ( e.g. , gravity , particle simulations \\t) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , fire and water simulations . \\nThese techniques fall under the \\tcategory of 3D dynamics . \\n< /doc > < doc id= '' 594 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=594 '' title= '' Apollo '' \\t> Apollo Apollo is one of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . \\nThe national divinity of the Greeks , Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery , music and \\tdance , truth and prophecy , healing and diseases , the Sun and light , poetry , and more . \\nOne of the most important and complex of the Greek gods , he is the son \\tof Zeus and Leto , and the twin brother of Artemis , goddess of the hunt . \\nSeen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the `` kouros '' ( ephebe , or a \\tbeardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods . \\nApollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan \\tmythology as `` Apulu '' . \\nAs the patron deity of Delphi ( `` Apollo Pythios '' ) \\t, Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . \\nApollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil \\t; various epithets call him the `` averter of evil '' . \\nMedicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through \\tthe god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius . \\nApollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a \\tgod who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows . \\nThe invention of archery itself is credited \\tto Apollo and his sister Artemis . \\nApollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden \\tbow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows . \\nApollo 's capacity to make youths grow is one of \\tthe best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona . \\nAs a protector of the young ( ) , Apollo \\tis concerned with the health and education of children . \\nHe presided over their \\tpassage into adulthood . \\nLong hair , which was the prerogative of boys , was cut \\tat the coming of age ( ) and dedicated to Apollo . \\nApollo is an important pastoral deity , and \\twas the patron of herdsmen and shepherds . \\nProtection of herds , flocks and crops from diseases \\t, pests and predators were his primary duties . \\nOn the other hand , Apollo also encouraged \\tfounding new towns and establishment of civil constitution . \\nHe is associated with \\tdominion over colonists . \\nHe was the giver of laws , and his \\toracles were consulted before setting laws in a city . \\nAs the god of `` mousike '' , Apollo presides \\tover all music , songs , dance and poetry . \\nHe is the inventor of string-music , and the frequent companion \\tof the Muses , functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations . \\nThe lyre is a \\tcommon attribute of Apollo . \\nIn Hellenistic times , especially during the 5th century BCE , as `` Apollo Helios \\t'' he became identified among Greeks with Helios , the personification of the Sun . \\nIn Latin texts , however , there was no conflation of Apollo \\twith Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE . \\nApollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary \\tand mythological texts until the 5th century CE . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nApollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : , ( ) ; Doric : , ; Arcadocypriot : , ; Aeolic : , ; ) The name `` Apollo '' —unlike the related older name `` Paean '' —is generally not found in the Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) texts , \\talthough there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form `` ] pe-rjo- [ `` ( Linear B : ] - [ ) on the KN E 842 tablet , though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read `` Hyperion '' ( [ u ] -pe-rjo- [ ne ] ) . \\nThe etymology of the \\tname is uncertain . \\nThe spelling ( in Classical Attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era \\t, but the Doric form , ( ) , is more archaic , as it is derived from an earlier . \\nIt probably is a cognate to the Doric month `` Apellaios '' ( ) , and \\tthe offerings ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival ( ) . \\nAccording to some scholars , the words are derived from the Doric word ( ) , which originally meant `` \\twall , '' `` fence for animals '' and later `` assembly within the limits of the square . '' \\nApella ( ) is the name of the popular \\tassembly in Sparta , corresponding to the ( ) . \\nR. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with \\tthe noun and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form * '' Apalyun '' . \\nSeveral instances of popular etymology \\tare attested from ancient authors . \\nThus , the Greeks most often associated Apollo 's name with \\tthe Greek verb ( ) , `` to destroy '' . \\nPlato in `` Cratylus '' connects the name with ( ) , `` redemption '' , with ( `` apolousis '' ) , `` purification '' , and with \\t( ) , `` simple '' , in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name , , and finally with ( ) , `` ever-shooting '' . \\nHesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ( ) , which means `` assembly '' , so that Apollo would be the god of political life \\t, and he also gives the explanation ( ) , `` fold '' , in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds . \\nIn the ancient Macedonian language ( ) means `` stone , '' and some toponyms may be derived from this word \\t: ( Pella , the capital of ancient Macedonia ) and ( `` Pellēnē '' / '' Pellene '' ) . \\nThe Hittite form `` Apaliunas '' ( `` d \\t'' ) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter . \\nThe Hittite testimony reflects an early form `` '' , which \\tmay also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . \\nThe name of the Lydian god `` Qλdãns '' /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization , syncope , and the pre-Lydian sound change * y \\t`` & gt ; '' d. Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric `` Ἀπέλjων '' and Hittite `` Apaliunas '' . \\nA Luwian etymology suggested for `` Apaliunas '' makes Apollo `` The One \\tof Entrapment '' , perhaps in the sense of `` Hunter '' . \\nGreco-Roman \\tepithets . \\nApollo 's chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , \\t`` Phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . \\nIt was very commonly used by both the Greeks and \\tRomans for Apollo 's role as the god of light . \\nLike other Greek deities , he had a number of others applied to him , \\treflecting the variety of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the god . \\nHowever , while Apollo has a great number of appellations in \\tGreek myth , only a few occur in Latin literature . \\nOrigin and \\tbirth . \\nApollo 's birthplace was Mount Cynthus \\ton the island of Delos . \\nPlace of \\tworship . \\nDelphi and Actium were his \\tprimary places of worship . \\nCeltic epithets and \\tcult titles . \\nApollo was worshipped throughout \\tthe Roman Empire . \\nIn the traditionally Celtic lands , he was most \\toften seen as a healing and sun god . \\nHe was often equated with \\tCeltic gods of similar character . \\nOrigins \\t. \\nThe cult centers of Apollo in Greece , Delphi \\tand Delos , date from the 8th century BCE . \\nThe Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to \\tArtemis , Apollo 's twin sister . \\nAt Delphi , Apollo was venerated as \\tthe slayer of the monstrous serpent Python . \\nFor the Greeks , Apollo was the most Greek of all \\tthe gods , and through the centuries he acquired different functions . \\nIn Archaic Greece he was the prophet , the oracular god \\twho in older times was connected with `` healing '' . \\nIn Classical Greece he was the god of light and of music , \\tbut in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil . \\nWalter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship , which he termed \\t`` a Dorian-northwest Greek component , a Cretan-Minoan component , and a Syro-Hittite component . '' \\nHealer and god-protector \\tfrom evil . \\nIn classical times , his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and he was therefore called `` apotropaios '' \\t( , `` averting evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from v. + n. ) . \\nApollo also had many epithets relating \\tto his function as a healer . \\nSome commonly-used examples are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' \\t) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of the plague '' ) . \\nIn later writers , the word , `` paion '' , usually spelled `` Paean '' \\t, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing . \\nApollo in his aspect of `` healer '' has a connection to the primitive \\tgod Paean ( ) , who did not have a cult of his own . \\nPaean serves as the healer of the gods in the `` Iliad \\t'' , and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion . \\nIt is suggested , though unconfirmed , that he is connected to \\tthe Mycenaean figure `` pa-ja-wo-ne '' ( Linear B : ) . \\nPaean was the personification of holy songs sung by `` seer-doctors \\t'' ( ) , which were supposed to cure disease . \\nHomer illustrated Paeon the god and the \\tsong both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph . \\nSuch songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods : to \\tDionysus , to Apollo Helios , to Apollo 's son Asclepius the healer . \\nAbout the 4th century BCE , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was \\teither to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . \\nIt was in this way that Apollo had \\tbecome recognized as the god of music . \\nApollo 's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be \\tsung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won . \\nIn the `` Iliad '' , Apollo is the healer under the gods , but he is also the bringer \\tof disease and death with his arrows , similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra . \\nHe sends a plague ( \\t) to the Achaeans . \\nKnowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent , they purify themselves \\tin a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows , called a hecatomb . \\nDorian \\torigin . \\nThe `` Homeric Hymn to Apollo '' depicts \\tApollo as an intruder from the north . \\nThe connection with the northern-dwelling Dorians and their initiation festival `` apellai '' \\tis reinforced by the month `` Apellaios '' in northwest Greek calendars . \\nThe family-festival was dedicated to \\tApollo ( Doric : ) . \\n`` Apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and Apellon \\tis the `` megistos kouros '' ( the great Kouros ) . \\nHowever it can explain only the Doric type of the name , which is connected \\twith the Ancient Macedonian word `` pella '' ( Pella ) , `` stone '' . \\nStones played an important part in the cult of the god \\t, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ( Omphalos ) . \\nMinoan \\torigin . \\nGeorge Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity \\tPaiawon , worshipped in Crete , to have originated at Delphi . \\nIn the `` Homeric Hymn '' , Apollo appeared as a dolphin and \\tcarried Cretan priests to Delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices . \\n`` Apollo Delphinios '' or `` Delphidios '' was a \\tsea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands . \\nApollo 's sister Artemis , who was the Greek goddess of hunting , is identified \\twith Britomartis ( Diktynna ) , the Minoan `` Mistress of the animals '' . \\nIn her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the `` Master of the animals '' , a bow-wielding god of \\thunting whose name has been lost ; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo . \\nAnatolian \\torigin . \\nA non-Greek origin of Apollo has \\tlong been assumed in scholarship . \\nThe name of Apollo 's mother Leto has Lydian origin , \\tand she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor . \\nThe inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia , which is \\tthe origin of Sibyl , and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated . \\nOmens , symbols , purifications , and \\texorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts . \\nThese rituals were spread into the empire of \\tthe Hittites , and from there into Greece . \\nHomer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans , \\tfighting against the Achaeans , during the Trojan War . \\nHe is pictured as a terrible god , \\tless trusted by the Greeks than other gods . \\nThe god seems to be related to `` Appaliunas '' , a tutelary god of \\tWilusa ( Troy ) in Asia Minor , but the word is not complete . \\nThe stones found in front of the gates \\tof Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo . \\nA western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of `` Artimus '' ( Artemis ) and \\t`` Qλdãns '' , whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms , in surviving Lydian texts '' . '' \\nHowever , recent scholars have cast doubt on \\tthe identification of `` Qλdãns '' with Apollo . \\nThe Greeks gave to him the name `` agyieus '' as the protector god of public \\tplaces and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column . \\nHowever , while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon , all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the \\tseventh day of the month , and the emphasis given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates a Babylonian origin . \\nThe Late Bronze Age ( from 1700 to 1200 BCE ) Hittite and Hurrian \\t`` Aplu '' was a god of plague , invoked during plague years . \\nHere we have an apotropaic situation , where a god \\toriginally bringing the plague was invoked to end it . \\nAplu , meaning `` the son of '' , was a title given to the \\tgod Nergal , who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash . \\nHomer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ( ) who brings death and disease with his arrows , \\tbut who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods . \\nIn `` Iliad '' , his priest prays to `` Apollo Smintheus '' , the \\tmouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats . \\nAll these functions , including the function of the healer-god Paean , who \\tseems to have Mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of Apollo . \\nProto-Indo-European \\t. \\nThe Vedic Rudra has some \\tsimilar functions with Apollo . \\nThe terrible god is called `` the archer '' \\tand the bow is also an attribute of Shiva . \\nRudra could bring diseases with his arrows , but he was able to \\tfree people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god . \\nHowever the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong \\trelation with omens , exorcisms , and with the oracular cult . \\nOracular \\tcult . \\nUnusually among the Olympic deities , Apollo had two cult \\tsites that had widespread influence : Delos and Delphi . \\nIn cult practice , Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo ( the Apollo of Delphi \\t) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . \\nLycia was sacred to the god , \\tfor this Apollo was also called Lycian . \\nApollo 's cult was already fully established when \\twritten sources commenced , about 650 BCE . \\nApollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of \\ttheophoric names such as `` Apollodorus '' or `` Apollonios '' and cities named `` Apollonia '' testify to his popularity . \\nOracular sanctuaries to Apollo were \\testablished in other sites . \\nIn the 2nd and 3rd century CE , those at Didyma and Claros pronounced the so-called `` theological oracles \\t'' , in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest deity . \\n`` In the 3rd century \\t, Apollo fell silent . \\nJulian the Apostate ( 359–361 ) tried to \\trevive the Delphic oracle , but failed . '' \\nOracular \\tshrines . \\nApollo had a famous oracle in Delphi , \\tand other notable ones in Claros and Didyma . \\nHis oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis , where he bore the toponymic epithet `` Abaeus '' \\t( , `` Apollon Abaios '' ) , was important enough to be consulted by Croesus . \\nHis oracular shrines include : Oracles were \\talso given by sons of Apollo . \\nTemples of \\tApollo . \\nMany temples were dedicated to Apollo \\tin Greece and the Greek colonies . \\nThey show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek \\tarchitecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations . \\nSome of the earliest temples , especially in Crete \\t, do not belong to any Greek order . \\nIt seems that the first peripteral \\ttemples were rectangular wooden structures . \\nThe different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved \\tin the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order . \\nThe Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects \\twas a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . \\nThe temples should be canonic , and the \\tarchitects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . \\nFrom the earliest times there were certain rules \\tstrictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings . \\nThe first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof , and when \\tthe dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms . \\nThis probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras , who believed that \\tbehind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics . \\nThe Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem \\tregarding the position of the triglyphs , which could n't be solved without changing the original forms . \\nThe order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order , but the Ionic \\tcapital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple . \\nBoth orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order \\tgradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome . \\nThe most important temples \\tare : Mythology . \\nApollo appears often in the \\tmyths , plays and hymns . \\nAs Zeus ' favorite son , Apollo had direct access to the \\tmind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans . \\nA divinity beyond human comprehension , he appears \\tboth as a beneficial and a wrathful god . \\nBirth \\t. \\nApollo was the son of Zeus , the king of the gods \\t, and Leto , his previous wife or one of his mistresses . \\nGrowing up , Apollo was nursed by the nymphs \\tKorythalia and Aletheia , the personification of truth . \\nWhen Zeus ' wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant , \\tshe banned Leto from giving birth on `` terra firma '' . \\nLeto sought shelter in many lands , \\tonly to be rejected by them . \\nFinally , the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating \\tisland named Delos that had once been Asteria , Leto 's own sister . \\nSince it was neither a mainland nor an island , Leto was readily \\twelcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree . \\nAll the goddesses except Hera were \\tpresent to witness the event . \\nIt is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia , the goddess \\tof childbirth , to prevent Leto from going into labor . \\nThe other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her \\ta necklace of amber 9 yards ( 8.2 m ) long . \\nWhen Apollo was born , clutching a golden sword , everything on \\tDelos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance . \\nSwans circled the island seven times \\tand the nymphs sang in delight . \\nHe was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered \\thim in white garment and fastened golden bands around him . \\nSince Leto was unable to feed him , Themis , the goddess \\tof divine law , fed him with nectar , or ambrosia . \\nUpon tasting the divine food , Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that \\the would be the master of lyre and archery , and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind . \\nZeus , who had calmed Hera by then , \\tcame and adorned his son with a golden headband . \\nApollo 's birth fixed the \\tfloating Delos to the earth . \\nLeto promised that her son would \\tbe always favorable towards the Delians . \\nAccording to some , Apollo secured Delos to \\tthe bottom of the ocean after some time . \\nThis island became sacred to Apollo and was one \\tof the major cult centres of the god . \\nApollo was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of \\tthe month Thargelion—according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition . \\nThe seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and \\tfull moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him . \\nMythographers agree that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo or was born on the \\tisland of Ortygia then helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo . \\nHyperborea \\t. \\nHyperborea , the mystical land of eternal spring \\t, venerated Apollo above all the gods . \\nThe Hyperboreans always sang and danced in \\this honor and hosted Pythian games . \\nThere , a vast forest of beautiful trees \\twas called `` the garden of Apollo '' . \\nApollo spent the winter \\tmonths among the Hyperboreans . \\nHis absence from the world caused coldness and \\tthis was marked as his annual death . \\nNo prophecies were issued \\tduring this time . \\nHe returned to the world during \\tthe beginning of the spring . \\nThe `` Theophania '' festival was held \\tin Delphi to celebrate his return . \\nIt is said that Leto came to Delos \\tfrom Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves . \\nHenceforth , Hyperborea became Apollo 's winter \\thome and wolves became sacred to him . \\nHis intimate connection to wolves is evident from his \\tepithet `` Lyceus '' , meaning `` wolf-like '' . \\nBut Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role \\tas the god who protected flocks from predators . \\nThe Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks \\tof Apollo being worshipped as the sun god . \\nShamanistic elements in Apollo 's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin \\t, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman . \\nShamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the \\tfollowers of Apollo , who hailed from Hyperborea . \\nIn myths , the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius \\tdied became the waters of the river Eridanos , which surrounded Hyperborea . \\nApollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which \\the had used to kill the Cyclopes . \\nHe later gave this \\tarrow to Abaris . \\nChildhood and \\tyouth . \\nAs a child , Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an \\taltar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted . \\nSince he learnt the art of building when young , he later came to be known as Archegetes \\t, `` the founder ( of towns ) '' and god who guided men to build new cities . \\nFrom his father Zeus , Apollo had also \\treceived a golden chariot drawn by swans . \\nIn his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows , he was reared \\tby Thriae , the bee nymphs , who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills . \\nApollo is also said to have invented the lyre , \\tand along with Artemis , the art of archery . \\nHe then taught to the humans \\tthe art of healing and archery . \\nPhoebe , his grandmother , gave the oracular shrine \\tof Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift . \\nThemis inspired him to be the \\toracular voice of Delphi thereon . \\nPython \\t. \\nPython , a chthonic serpent-dragon , was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the Delphic \\tOracle , whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto 's womb . \\nPython was the nurse \\tof the giant Typhon . \\nIn most of the traditions , Apollo was \\tstill a child when he killed Python . \\nPython was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant \\tLeto to death , and had assaulted her . \\nTo avenge the trouble given to his mother , Apollo went in search of Python and killed it \\tin the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from Hephaestus . \\nThe Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during \\tthe battle with the cry `` Hie Paean '' . \\nAfter Apollo was victorious , they also brought him \\tgifts and gave the Corycian cave to him . \\nAccording to Homer , Apollo had encountered and killed the Python \\twhen he was looking for a place to establish his shrine . \\nAccording to another version , when Leto was \\tin Delphi , Python had attacked her . \\nApollo defended his mother \\tand killed Python . \\nEuripides in his `` Iphigenia in Aulis '' gives an account \\tof his fight with Python and the event 's aftermath . \\nA detailed account of Apollo 's conflict with Gaia and Zeus \\t' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given . \\nApollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made \\tinferior to his , a wish that Zeus granted him readily . \\nBecause of this , Athena , who had been practicing divination \\tby throwing pebbles , cast her pebbles away in displeasure . \\nHowever , Apollo had committed a blood \\tmurder and had to be purified . \\nBecause Python was a child of Gaia , Gaia wanted \\tApollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment . \\nZeus did n't agree and instead exiled his son \\tfrom Olympus , and instructed him to get purified . \\nApollo had to serve as \\ta slave for nine years . \\nAfter the servitude was over , as per his father 's order , \\the travelled to the Vale of Tempe to bath in waters of Peneus . \\nThere Zeus himself performed \\tpurificatory rites on Apollo . \\nPurified , Apollo was escorted by his half sister Athena to Delphi \\twhere the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaia . \\nAccording to a variation , Apollo had also \\ttravelled to Crete , where Carmanor purified him . \\nApollo later established the Pythian \\tgames to appropriate Gaia . \\nHenceforth , Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of \\tmurder and , made men aware of their guilt and purified them . \\nSoon after , Zeus instructed Apollo to \\tgo to Delphi and establish his law . \\nBut Apollo , disobeying his father , went to the \\tland of Hyperborea and stayed there for a year . \\nHe returned only after the Delphians sang hymns \\tto him and pleaded him to come back . \\nZeus , pleased with his son 's integrity , gave \\tApollo the seat next to him on his right side . \\nHe also gave to Apollo various gifts , like a golden tripod , a \\tgolden bow and arrows , a golden chariot and the city of Delphi . \\nSoon after his return , Apollo \\tneeded to recruit people to Delphi . \\nSo , when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete \\t, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin . \\nThe crew was awed into submission and followed \\ta course that led the ship to Delphi . \\nThere Apollo revealed himself \\tas a god . \\nInitiating them to his service , he instructed \\tthem to keep righteousness in their hearts . \\nThe Pythia was Apollo 's high priestess and \\this mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies . \\nPythia is arguably the constant favorite \\tof Apollo among the mortals . \\nTityos \\t. \\nHera once again sent another giant \\t, Tityos to rape Leto . \\nThis time Apollo shot him with his arrows \\tand attacked him with his golden sword . \\nAccording to other version , Artemis also aided him in \\tprotecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows . \\nAfter the battle Zeus finally relented his \\taid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus . \\nThere , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area \\tof , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver . \\nAdmetus \\t. \\nAdmetus was the king of Pherae , \\twho was known for his hospitality . \\nWhen Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python , he served \\tas a herdsman under Admetus , who was then young and unmarried . \\nApollo is said to have shared a \\tromantic relationship with Admetus during his stay . \\nAfter completing his years of servitude , Apollo \\twent back to Olympus as a god . \\nBecause Admetus had treated Apollo well , the \\tgod conferred great benefits on him in return . \\nApollo 's mere presence is said to have \\tmade the cattle give birth to twins . \\nApollo helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis , the daughter of King Pelias \\t, by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus ' chariot . \\nHe was present during their \\twedding to give his blessings . \\nWhen Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the \\tdue offerings , Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister . \\nWhen Apollo learnt of Admetus ' untimely death , he convinced \\tor tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time . \\nAccording to another version , or perhaps some years later , when Zeus struck down Apollo 's son Asclepius with a \\tlightning bolt for resurrecting the dead , Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes , who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus . \\nApollo would have been banished to Tartarus for this , but his mother Leto intervened , \\tand reminding Zeus of their old love , pleaded him not to kill their son . \\nZeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year \\tof hard labor once again under Admetus . \\nThe love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored \\ttopic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius . \\nNiobe \\t. \\nThe fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo \\twhile he was still in Leto 's womb . \\nNiobe was the queen of \\tThebes and wife of Amphion . \\nShe displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen \\tchildren ( Niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while Leto had only two . \\nShe further mocked Apollo 's effeminate \\tappearance and Artemis ' manly appearance . \\nLeto , insulted by this , \\ttold her children to punish Niobe . \\nAccordingly , Apollo killed Niobe 's \\tsons , and Artemis her daughters . \\nAccording to some versions of the myth , among the Niobids , Chloris \\tand her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto . \\nAmphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either \\tkilled himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge . \\nA devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia \\tMinor and turned into stone as she wept . \\nHer tears formed \\tthe river Achelous . \\nZeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the \\tNiobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them . \\nWhen Chloris married and had children , Apollo granted her son \\tNestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids . \\nHence , Nestor was able \\tto live for 3 generations . \\nBuilding the walls \\tof Troy . \\nOnce Apollo and Poseidon served under the Trojan \\tking Laomedon in accordance to Zeus ' words . \\nApollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king \\tdisguised as humans in order to check his hubris . \\nApollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of \\tmount Ida , while Poseidon built the walls of Troy . \\nOther versions make both Apollo and \\tPoseidon the builders of the wall . \\nIn Ovid 's account , Apollo completes his \\ttask by playing his tunes on his lyre . \\nIn Pindar 's odes , the gods took \\ta mortal named Aeacus as their assistant . \\nWhen the work was completed , three snakes rushed against the wall , and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built \\tby the gods fell down dead , the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus . \\nApollo immediately prophesied that Troy would fall at the hands \\tof Aeacus 's descendants , the Aeacidae ( i.e . \\nhis son Telamon joined Heracles when he \\tsieged the city during Laomedon 's rule . \\nLater , his great-grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden \\thorse that lead to the downfall of Troy ) . \\nHowever , the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised \\t, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands , and sell them as slaves . \\nAngered by the unpaid labour and the insults , Apollo infected the \\tcity with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster Cetus . \\nTo deliver the city from it , Laomedon had to sacrifice his \\tdaughter Hesione ( who would later be saved by Heracles ) . \\nDuring his stay in Troy , Apollo had a lover named \\tOurea , who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon . \\nTogether they had a son named \\tIleus , whom Apollo loved dearly . \\nTrojan \\tWar . \\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan \\tWar waged by the Greeks against the Trojans . \\nDuring the war , the Greek king Agamemnon captured Chryseis , the \\tdaughter of Apollo 's priest Chryses , and refused to return her . \\nAngered by this , Apollo shot arrows infected \\twith the plague into the Greek encampment . \\nHe demanded that they return the girl , and the Achaeans ( Greeks ) complied , indirectly \\tcausing the `` anger of Achilles '' , which is the theme of the `` Iliad '' . \\nReceiving the aegis from Zeus , Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father \\t's command , causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry . \\nHe pushed the Greeks back and \\tdestroyed many of the soldiers . \\nHe is described as `` the rouser of armies '' because \\the rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart . \\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the \\twar , Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel . \\nHowever , Apollo declined to fight him , saying that he \\twould n't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals . \\nWhen the Greek hero Diomedes injured the Trojan hero Aeneas , Aphrodite \\ttried to rescue him , but Diomedes injured her as well . \\nApollo then enveloped Aeneas in \\ta cloud to protect him . \\nHe repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the \\thero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god . \\nAeneas was then taken to Pergamos , a sacred \\tspot in Troy , where he was healed . \\nAfter the death of Sarpedon , a son of Zeus , Apollo rescued the \\tcorpse from the battlefield as per his father 's wish and cleaned it . \\nHe then gave it to Sleep ( \\tHypnos ) and Death ( Thanatos ) . \\nApollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that \\tday , so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while . \\nThe Trojan hero Hector ( who , according to some , was \\tthe god 's own son by Hecuba ) was favored by Apollo . \\nWhen he got severely injured , Apollo healed him \\tand encouraged him to take up his arms . \\nDuring a duel with Achilles , when Hector was about to lose \\t, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him . \\nWhen the Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the \\tfort of Troy , he was stopped by Apollo . \\nEncouraging Hector to attack Patroclus , Apollo stripped the \\tarmour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons . \\nPatroclus was eventually \\tkilled by Hector . \\nAt last , after Hector 's fated death , Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles ' attempt to mutilate \\tit by creating a magical cloud over the corpse , shielding it from the rays of the sun . \\nApollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son \\tTenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son Troilus in his own temple . \\nNot only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles , he also tricked Achilles by \\tdisguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates . \\nHe foiled Achilles ' attempt to \\tmutilate Hector 's dead body . \\nFinally , Apollo caused Achilles ' death by guiding \\tan arrow shot by Paris into Achilles ' heel . \\nIn some versions , Apollo himself killed \\tAchilles by taking the disguise of Paris . \\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors , including Agenor \\t, Polydamas , Glaucus in the battlefield . \\nThough he greatly favored the Trojans , Apollo was bound to follow \\tthe orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war . \\nHeracles \\t. \\nAfter Heracles ( then named Alcides ) was struck with madness and killed his \\tfamily , he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo . \\nApollo , through the Pythia , commanded him to serve king Eurystheus for \\ttwelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him . \\nOnly then would Alcides be \\tabsolved of his sin . \\nApollo also renamed \\thim as Heracles . \\nTo complete his third task , Heracles had to capture the Ceryneian Hind \\t, a hind sacred to Artemis , and bring back it alive . \\nAfter chasing the hind for one year , the animal eventually got tired \\t, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon , Heracles captured it . \\nWhile he was taking it back , he was confronted by Apollo \\tand Artemis , who were angered at Heracles for this act . \\nHowever , Heracles soothed the goddess \\tand explained his situation to her . \\nAfter much pleading , Artemis permitted him to take \\tthe hind and told him to return it later . \\nAfter he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus , Heracles fell in \\tconflict with Iphytus , a prince of Oechalia , and murdered him . \\nSoon after , he \\tcontracted a terrible disease . \\nHe consulted the oracle of Apollo once again , \\tin hope of ridding himself of the disease . \\nThe Pythia , however , \\tdenied to give any prophesy . \\nIn anger , Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started \\twalking away , intending to start his own oracle . \\nHowever , Apollo did not tolerate this and \\tstopped Heracles ; a duel ensued between them . \\nArtemis rushed to support Apollo \\t, while Athena supported Heracles . \\nSoon , Zeus threw his thunderbolt between \\tthe fighting brothers and separated them . \\nHe reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and \\tasked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles . \\nApollo then ordered the hero to serve under Omphale , queen \\tof Lydia for one year in order to purify himself . \\nPeriphas \\t. \\nPeriphas was an Attican king \\tand a priest of Apollo . \\nHe was noble , \\tjust and rich . \\nHe did all \\this duties justly . \\nBecause of this people were very fond of him and \\tstarted honouring him to the same extent as Zeus . \\nAt one point , they worshipped Periphas in place of \\tZeus and set up shrines and temples for him . \\nThis annoyed Zeus , who decided to \\tannihilate the entire family of Periphas . \\nBut because he was a just king and a good devotee \\t, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas . \\nZeus considered Apollo 's words and \\tagreed to let him live . \\nBut he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and \\tmade the eagle the king of birds . \\nWhen Periphas ' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her \\thusband , Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish . \\nPlato 's concept \\tof soulmates . \\nA long time ago , there were three kinds of human beings : male , descended from \\tthe sun ; female , descended from the earth ; and androgynous , descended from the moon . \\nEach human being was completely round , with four arms and fours legs , two identical \\tfaces on opposite sides of a head with four ears , and all else to match . \\nThey were powerful \\tand unruly . \\nOtis and Ephialtes even dared \\tto scale Mount Olympus . \\nTo check their insolence , Zeus devised a plan to humble \\tthem and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them . \\nHe cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary \\trepairs , giving humans the individual shape they still have now . \\nApollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds , he pulled together their \\tskin at the abdomen , and sewed the skin together at the middle of it . \\nThis is what we \\tcall navel today . \\nHe smoothened the wrinkles \\tand shaped the chest . \\nBut he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and \\taround the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment . \\nNurturer of \\tthe young . \\nApollo `` Kourotrophos '' is the god who nurtures \\tand protects children and the young , especially boys . \\nHe oversees their education and \\ttheir passage into adulthood . \\nEducation is said to have originated \\tfrom Apollo and the Muses . \\nMany myths have him \\ttrain his children . \\nIt was a custom for boys to cut and \\tdedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood . \\nChiron , the abandoned centaur , was fostered by Apollo , \\twho instructed him in medicine , prophecy , archery and more . \\nChiron would later become \\ta great teacher himself . \\nAsclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge \\tpertaining to medicinal arts by his father . \\nHowever , he was later entrusted \\tto Chiron for further education . \\nAnius , Apollo 's son by Rhoeo , was \\tabandoned by his mother soon after his birth . \\nApollo brought him up and \\teducated him in mantic arts . \\nAnius later became the priest of \\tApollo and the king of Delos . \\nIamus was the son \\tof Apollo and Evadne . \\nWhen Evadne went into labour , Apollo \\tsent the Moirai to assist his lover . \\nAfter the child was born , Apollo sent \\tsnakes to feed the child some honey . \\nWhen Iamus reached the age of education , Apollo took him to Olympia and taught \\thim many arts , including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds . \\nIdmon was educated by Apollo \\tto be a seer . \\nEven though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with \\tthe Argonauts , he embraced his destiny and died a brave death . \\nTo commemorate his son 's bravery , Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a \\ttown around the tomb of the hero , and to honor him . \\nApollo adopted Carnus , the abandoned \\tson of Zeus and Europa . \\nHe reared the child with the help of his \\tmother Leto and educated him to be a seer . \\nWhen his son Melaneus reached the age of marriage , Apollo asked the princess Stratonice to \\tbe his son 's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed . \\nApollo saved a shepherd boy ( name unknown ) from death \\tin a large deep cave , by the means of vultures . \\nTo thank him , the shepherd built \\tApollo a temple under the name Vulturius . \\nGod of \\tmusic . \\nImmediately after his birth , Apollo demanded a lyre and \\tinvented the paean , thus becoming the god of music . \\nAs the divine singer , he is the \\tpatron of poets , singers and musicians . \\nThe invention of string music \\tis attributed to him . \\nPlato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music \\t, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses . \\nAccording to Socrates , ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the \\tharmony and makes all things move together , both for the gods and the humans . \\nFor this reason , he was called `` Homopolon '' before \\tthe `` Homo '' was replaced by `` A '' . \\nApollo 's harmonious music delivered people from their pain , and \\thence , like Dionysus , he is also called the liberator . \\nThe swans , which were considered to be the most musical among the \\tbirds , were believed to be the `` singers of Apollo '' . \\nThey are Apollo 's sacred birds and acted \\tas his vehicle during his travel to Hyperborea . \\nAelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to \\tApollo , the swans would join the chant in unison . \\nAmong the Pythagoreans , the study of mathematics and music were \\tconnected to the worship of Apollo , their principal deity . \\nTheir belief was that the music purifies the \\tsoul , just as medicine purifies the body . \\nThey also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the \\tmechanics of the cosmos , evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres . \\nApollo appears as the companion of the Muses , and as Musagetes \\t( `` leader of Muses '' ) he leads them in dance . \\nThey spend their time on Parnassus , \\twhich is one of their sacred places . \\nApollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them \\the became the father of famous musicians like Orpheus and Linus . \\nApollo is often found delighting the immortal gods \\twith his songs and music on the lyre . \\nIn his role as the god of banquets , he was always present to play music in \\tweddings of the gods , like the marriage of Eros and Psyche , Peleus and Thetis . \\nHe is a frequent guest of the Bacchanalia , and many ancient \\tceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs . \\nApollo also participated in musical \\tcontests when challenged by others . \\nHe was the victor in all those contests , but \\the tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris . \\nApollo 's \\tlyre . \\nThe invention of lyre is attributed either \\tto Hermes or to Apollo himself . \\nDistinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise \\tshell , whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre . \\nMyths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo 's cows and \\ttook them to a cave in the woods near Pylos , covering their tracks . \\nIn the cave , he found a tortoise \\tand killed it , then removed the insides . \\nHe used one of the cow 's intestines \\tand the tortoise shell and made his lyre . \\nUpon discovering the theft , Apollo confronted Hermes \\tand asked him to return his cattle . \\nWhen Hermes acted innocent , Apollo \\ttook the matter to Zeus . \\nZeus , having seen the events , sided with \\tApollo , and ordered Hermes to return the cattle . \\nHermes then began to play music \\ton the lyre he had invented . \\nApollo fell in love with the instrument and \\toffered to exchange the cattle for the lyre . \\nHence , Apollo then became \\tthe master of the lyre . \\nAccording to other versions , Apollo had invented the lyre himself , whose strings \\the tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas . \\nHermes ' lyre , therefore \\t, would be a reinvention . \\nContest with \\tPan . \\nOnce Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of \\tApollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest . \\nThe mountain-god Tmolus was \\tchosen to umpire . \\nPan blew on his pipes , and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction \\tto himself and his faithful follower , Midas , who happened to be present . \\nThen , Apollo struck the \\tstrings of his lyre . \\nIt was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory \\tto Apollo , and everyone was pleased with the judgement . \\nOnly Midas dissented and questioned \\tthe justice of the award . \\nApollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any \\tlonger , and caused them to become the ears of a donkey . \\nContest with \\tMarsyas . \\nMarsyas was a satyr who was \\tpunished by Apollo for his hubris . \\nHe had found an aulos on the ground , tossed away \\tafter being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy . \\nAthena had also placed a curse upon the instrument , \\tthat whoever would pick it up would be severely punished . \\nWhen Marsyas played the flute , \\teveryone became frenzied with joy . \\nThis led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo \\t, and he challenged the god to a musical contest . \\nThe contest was judged by the Muses \\t, or the nymphs of Nysa . \\nAthena was also present \\tto witness the contest . \\nMarsyas taunted Apollo for `` wearing his hair long , for having a fair \\tface and smooth body , for his skill in so many arts '' . \\nHe also further said , The Muses \\tand Athena sniggered at this comment . \\nThe contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was \\tthat the victor could `` do whatever he wanted '' to the loser . \\nAccording to one account , after the first round \\t, they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads . \\nBut in the next round , Apollo decided to play on \\this lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance . \\nMarsyas argued against this , saying that Apollo would \\thave an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating . \\nBut Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute , which needed air blown from the throat , it was similar to singing , \\tand that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all . \\nThe nymphs decided that Apollo \\t's argument was just . \\nApollo then played his lyre and sang at \\tthe same time , mesmerising the audience . \\nMarsyas could not \\tdo this . \\nApollo was declared the winner and , angered with Marsyas ' \\thaughtiness and his accusations , decided to flay the satyr . \\nAccording to another account , Marsyas played his flute out \\tof tune at one point and accepted his defeat . \\nOut of shame , he assigned to himself the \\tpunishment of being skinned for a wine sack . \\nAnother variation is that Apollo \\tplayed his instrument upside down . \\nMarsyas could not do \\tthis with his instrument . \\nSo the Muses who were the \\tjudges declared Apollo the winner . \\nApollo hung Marsyas from a \\ttree to flay him . \\nApollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near \\tCelaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . \\nHe then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas \\t' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others . \\nMarsyas ' blood turned \\tinto the river Marsyas . \\nBut Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done \\t, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away . \\nThe lyre was later discovered by the Muses \\tand Apollo 's sons Linus and Orpheus . \\nThe Muses fixed the middle string , Linus the string struck with the \\tforefinger , and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it . \\nThey took it back to Apollo , but the god , who had decided to stay away from music for a while \\t, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea . \\nContest with \\tCinyras . \\nCinyras was a ruler of Cyprus , \\twho was a friend of Agamemnon . \\nCinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan \\twar , but did not keep his promise . \\nAgamemnon cursed \\tCinyras . \\nHe invoked Apollo and asked the \\tgod to avenge the broken promise . \\nApollo then had a lyre-playing contest \\twith Cinyras , and defeated him . \\nEither Cinyras committed suicide when he lost \\t, or was killed by Apollo . \\nPatron of \\tsailors . \\nApollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors \\t, one of the duties he shares with Poseidon . \\nIn the myths , he is seen helping \\theroes who pray to him for safe journey . \\nWhen Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm , \\the quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi . \\nWhen the Argonauts faced a terrible storm , Jason prayed \\tto his patron , Apollo , to help them . \\nApollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light \\tupon an island , where the Argonauts soon took shelter . \\nThis island was renamed `` Anaphe '' , \\twhich means `` He revealed it '' . \\nApollo helped the Greek hero Diomedes , to escape \\tfrom a great tempest during his journey homeward . \\nAs a token of gratitude , Diomedes built a temple in honor \\tof Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius ( `` the embarker '' ) . \\nDuring the Trojan War , Odysseus came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis , \\tthe daughter of Apollo 's priest Chryses , and brought many offerings to Apollo . \\nPleased with this , Apollo sent gentle breezes that \\thelped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp . \\nArion was a poet who was kidnapped by \\tsome sailors for the rich prizes he possessed . \\nArion requested them to let him sing for the \\tlast time , to which the sailors consented . \\nArion began singing a song in praise of \\tApollo , seeking the god 's help . \\nConsequently , numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped \\tinto the water , the dolphins carried him away safely . \\nWars \\t. \\nTitanomachy \\t. \\nOnce Hera , out of spite , aroused the Titans \\tto war against Zeus and take away his throne . \\nAccordingly , when the Titans tried to climb Mount Olympus , Zeus with the help \\tof Apollo , Artemis and Athena , defeated them and cast them into tartarus . \\nTrojan \\tWar . \\nApollo played a pivotal role \\tin the entire Trojan War . \\nHe sided with the Trojans , and sent a terrible plague to the \\tGreek camp , which indirectly led to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon . \\nHe killed the Greek heroes Patroclus , \\tAchilles , and numerous Greek soldiers . \\nHe also helped many Trojan heroes , \\tthe most important one being Hector . \\nAfter the end of the war , Apollo and Poseidon \\ttogether cleaned the remains of the city and the camps . \\nTelegony \\twar . \\nA war broke out between the Brygoi and the \\tThesprotians , who had the support of Odysseus . \\nThe gods Athena and Ares came \\tto the battlefield and took sides . \\nAthena helped the hero Odysseus while \\tAres fought alongside of the Brygoi . \\nWhen Odysseus lost , Athena and \\tAres came into a direct duel . \\nTo stop the battling gods and the terror created by their \\tbattle , Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them . \\nIndian \\twar . \\nWhen Zeus suggested that Dionysus defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods , \\tDionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of Bacchantes and satyrs . \\nAmong the warriors was Aristaeus \\t, Apollo 's son . \\nApollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a \\tbow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm . \\nAfter Zeus urged Apollo to join the \\twar , he went to the battlefield . \\nSeeing several of his nymphs and Aristaeus drowning in a \\triver , he took them to safety and healed them . \\nHe taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent \\thim back to help the army of Dionysus . \\nTheban \\twar . \\nDuring the war between the sons of Oedipus , Apollo favored Amphiaraus \\t, a seer and one of the leaders in the war . \\nThough saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war , Apollo made Amphiaraus \\t' last hours glorious by `` lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam '' . \\nWhen Hypseus tried to kill the hero by a spear , \\tApollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead . \\nThen Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and \\ttook the reins in his hands . \\nHe deflected many spears \\tand arrows away them . \\nHe also killed many of the enemy warriors like \\tMelaneus , Antiphus , Aetion , Polites and Lampus . \\nAt last when the moment of departure came , Apollo expressed his grief with tears in \\this eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus , who was soon engulfed by the Earth . \\nSlaying of \\tgiants . \\nApollo killed the giants Python and Tityos \\t, who had assaulted his mother Leto . \\nGigantomachy \\t. \\nDuring the gigantomachy , Apollo and Heracles blinded the giant Ephialtes by shooting \\thim in his eyes , Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right . \\nHe also killed Porphyrion , the king of \\tgiants , using his bow and arrows . \\nAloadae \\t. \\nThe Aloadae , namely Otis and Ephialtes , were twin \\tgiants who decided to wage war upon the gods . \\nThey attempted to \\tstorm Mt . \\nOlympus by piling up mountains , and threatened to \\tfill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land . \\nThey even dared to seek the hand \\tof Hera and Artemis in marriage . \\nAngered by this , Apollo killed \\tthem by shooting them with arrows . \\nAccording to another tale , Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them ; as \\tthey tried to kill it with their javelins , they accidentally stabbed each other and died . \\nPhorbas \\t. \\nPhorbas was a savage giant king of Phlegyas \\twho was described as having swine like features . \\nHe wished to plunder \\tDelphi for its wealth . \\nHe seized the roads to Delphi \\tand started harassing the pilgrims . \\nHe captured the old people and children and sent \\tthem to his army to hold them for ransom . \\nAnd he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing , \\tonly to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him . \\nHe hung the chopped off \\theads to an oak tree . \\nFinally , Apollo came to put \\tan end to this cruelty . \\nHe entered a boxing contest with Phorbas \\tand killed him with a single blow . \\nOther \\tstories . \\nIn the first Olympic games , Apollo defeated \\tAres and became the victor in wrestling . \\nHe outran Hermes in the \\trace and won first place . \\nApollo divides months into \\tsummer and winter . \\nHe rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the \\twinter months , and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure . \\nDuring his absence , Delphi was under the care of \\tDionysus , and no prophecies were given during winters . \\nMolpadia and \\tParthenos . \\nMolpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of \\tRhoeo , a former lover of Apollo . \\nOne day , they were put in charge of watching their father \\t's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty . \\nWhile they were asleep , the wine jar \\twas broken by the swines their family kept . \\nWhen the sisters woke up and saw what had happened , they \\tthrew themselves off a cliff in fear of their father 's wrath . \\nApollo , who was passing by , caught them and carried them to \\ttwo different cities in Chersonesus , Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus . \\nHe turned them into goddesses and \\tthey both received divine honors . \\nMolpadia 's name was changed \\tto Hemithea upon her deification . \\nPrometheus \\t. \\nPrometheus was the titan who was \\tpunished by Zeus for stealing fire . \\nHe was bound to a rock , where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus \\t' liver , which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day . \\nSeeing his plight , Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan , \\twhile Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes . \\nZeus , moved by Apollo 's words and the tears \\tof the goddesses , finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus . \\nThe rock \\tof Leukas . \\nLeukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting \\tout from the island of Leukas into the sea . \\nIt was present in the \\tsanctuary of Apollo Leukates . \\nA leap from this rock was believed to have \\tput an end to the longings of love . \\nOnce , Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis , a young \\tman of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar . \\nHeartbroken , Aphrodite wandered looking \\tfor the rock of Leukas . \\nWhen she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos \\t, she confided in him her love and sorrow . \\nApollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked \\ther to throw herself from the top of the rock . \\nShe did so and was \\tfreed from her love . \\nWhen she sought for the reason behind this , Apollo told her that Zeus , before taking \\tanother lover , would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera . \\nAnother tale relates that a man named Nireus , who fell in love with the \\tcult statue of Athena , came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself . \\nAfter jumping , he fell into the net of a fisherman in which , \\twhen he was pulled out , he found a box filled with gold . \\nHe fought with the fisherman and took the gold , but Apollo appeared to him in \\tthe night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others . \\nIt was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every \\tyear at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil . \\nHowever , a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the \\tcriminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island . \\nThis was the same rock from which , according \\tto a legend , Sappho took her suicidal leap . \\nFemale \\tlovers . \\nLove affairs ascribed to Apollo are \\ta late development in Greek mythology . \\nTheir vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance \\t, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination . \\nDaphne was a nymph who scorned Apollo \\t's advances and ran away from him . \\nWhen Apollo chased her in order to persuade her \\t, she changed herself into a laurel tree . \\nAccording to other versions , she cried for help during the chase , and Gaia \\thelped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place . \\nAccording to Roman poet Ovid , the chase was brought about by Cupid , who \\thit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred . \\nThe myth explains the origin of the laurel and connection of Apollo with \\tthe laurel and its leaves , which his priestess employed at Delphi . \\nThe leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths \\twere given to the victors of the Pythian games . \\nApollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses , and \\tnot being able to choose one of them , decided to remain unwed . \\nHe fathered the Corybantes by the Muse Thalia , Orpheus by Calliope , Linus of \\tThrace by Calliope or Urania and Hymenaios ( Hymen ) by one of the Muses . \\nIn the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesoid \\t, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate . \\nCyrene was a Thessalian \\tprincess whom Apollo loved . \\nIn her honor , he built the \\tcity Cyrene and made her its ruler . \\nShe was later granted longevity by Apollo \\twho turned her into a nymph . \\nThe couple had two sons \\t, Aristaeus , and Idmon . \\nEvadne was a nymph daughter of \\tPoseidon and a lover of Apollo . \\nShe bore him a \\tson , Iamos . \\nDuring the time of the childbirth , Apollo sent \\tEileithyia , the goddess of childbirth to assist her . \\nRhoeo , a princess of the island \\tof Naxos was loved by Apollo . \\nOut of affection for her , \\tApollo turned her sisters into goddesses . \\nOn the island Delos she bore \\tApollo a son named Anius . \\nNot wanting to have the child , she \\tentrusted the infant to Apollo and left . \\nApollo raised and educated the \\tchild on his own . \\nOurea , a daughter of Poseidon , fell in love with \\tApollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king Laomedon . \\nThey both united on the day \\tthe walls of Troy were built . \\nShe bore to Apollo a son , whom Apollo named Ileus , \\tafter the city of his birth , Ilion ( Troy ) . \\nIleus was very \\tdear to Apollo . \\nThero , daughter of Phylas , a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams , \\twas loved by the radiant Apollo , and she loved him in return . \\nBy their union , she became mother of Chaeron , \\twho was famed as `` the tamer of horses '' . \\nHe later built \\tthe city Chaeronea . \\nHyrie or Thyrie was \\tthe mother of Cycnus . \\nApollo turned both the mother and son into swans when \\tthey jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves . \\nHecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy , \\tand Apollo had a son with her named Troilus . \\nAn oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as \\tlong as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive . \\nHe was ambushed and killed by Achilleus , \\tand Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles . \\nAfter the sack of Troy , Hecuba \\twas taken to Lycia by Apollo . \\nCoronis was daughter of Phlegyas \\t, King of the Lapiths . \\nWhile pregnant with Asclepius , Coronis fell in love with \\tIschys , son of Elatus and slept with him . \\nWhen Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his \\traven who informed him , he sent his sister , Artemis , to kill Coronis . \\nApollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis ' belly \\tand gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise . \\nDryope , the daughter of Dryops , was impregnated \\tby Apollo in the form of a snake . \\nShe gave birth to \\ta son named Amphissus . \\nIn Euripides ' play `` Ion '' , Apollo \\tfathered Ion by Creusa , wife of Xuthus . \\nHe used his powers to conceal \\ther pregnancy from her father . \\nLater , when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild , Apollo asked Hermes to save the \\tchild and bring him to the oracle at Delphi , where he was raised by a priestess . \\nApollo loved and kidnapped an \\tOceanid nymph , Melia . \\nHer father Oceanus sent one of his sons , Caanthus , to find her , but \\tCaanthus could not take her back from Apollo , so he burned Apollo 's sanctuary . \\nIn retaliation , Apollo \\tshot and killed Caanthus . \\nMale \\tlovers . \\nHyacinth ( or Hyacinthus ) , a beautiful and athletic \\tSpartan prince , was one of Apollo 's favourite lovers . \\nThe pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off \\tcourse by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head , killing him instantly . \\nApollo is said to \\tbe filled with grief . \\nOut of Hyacinthus ' blood , Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his \\tdeath , and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning `` alas '' . \\nHe was later resurrected \\tand taken to heaven . \\nThe festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta \\t, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus . \\nAnother male lover was Cyparissus \\t, a descendant of Heracles . \\nApollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally \\tkilled it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth . \\nCyparissus was so saddened by its death that he \\tasked Apollo to let his tears fall forever . \\nApollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him , which was \\tsaid to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk . \\nAdmetus , the king of Pherae \\t, was also Apollo 's lover . \\nDuring his exile , which lasted either for one year \\tor nine years , Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman . \\nThe romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria \\t, who wrote that Apollo was `` fired with love '' for Admetus . \\nPlutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo 's lovers and \\tsays that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him . \\nLatin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god , \\tApollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus . \\nTibullus describes Apollo 's love to the king as `` servitium amoris '' ( slavery of \\tlove ) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice . \\nHe would also make cheese \\tand serve it to Admetus . \\nHis domestic actions caused \\tembarrassment to his family . \\nWhen Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis , Apollo provided a \\tchariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed . \\nThis satisfied Alcestis ' father and \\the let Admetus marry his daughter . \\nFurther , Apollo saved the king from Artemis ' wrath and \\talso convinced the Moirai to postpone Admetus ' death once . \\nBranchus , a shepherd , one day \\tcame across Apollo in the woods . \\nCaptivated by the god 's \\tbeauty , he kissed Apollo . \\nApollo requited his affections and wanting to reward \\thim , bestowed prophetic skills on him . \\nHis descendants , the Branchides , \\twere an influential clan of prophets . \\nOther male lovers of \\tApollo include : Children . \\nApollo sired many children , from mortal women \\tand nymphs as well as the goddesses . \\nHis children grew up to be physicians , \\tmusicians , poets , seers or archers . \\nMany of his sons founded \\tnew cities and became kings . \\nThey were all \\tusually very beautiful . \\nAsclepius is the most \\tfamous son of Apollo . \\nHis skills as a physician \\tsurpassed that of Apollo 's . \\nZeus killed him for bringing back the dead , but upon \\tApollo 's request , he was resurrected as a god . \\nAristaeus was placed under the care \\tof Chiron after his birth . \\nHe became the god of beekeeping , \\tcheese making , animal husbandry and more . \\nHe was ultimately given immortality for the \\tbenefits he bestowed upon the humanity . \\nThe Corybantes were spear-clashing \\t, dancing demigods . \\nThe sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes Hector and Troilus , as well as \\tTenes , the king of Tenedos , all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war . \\nApollo 's children who became musicians and bards include Orpheus , \\tLinus , Ialemus , Hymenaeus , Philammon , Eumolpus and Eleuther . \\nApollo fathered 3 daughters , Apollonis , Borysthenis and Cephisso , who \\tformed a group of minor Muses , the `` Musa Apollonides '' . \\nThey were nicknamed Nete , Mese and Hypate after the \\thighest , middle and lowest strings of his lyre . \\nPhemonoe was a seer and a poetess \\twho was the inventor of Hexameter . \\nApis , Idmon , Iamus , Tenerus , Mopsus \\t, Galeus , Telmessus and others were gifted seers . \\nAnius , Pythaeus and Ismenus \\tlived as high priests . \\nMost of them were \\ttrained by Apollo himself . \\nArabus , Delphos , Dryops , Miletos , Tenes , Epidaurus , Ceos , Lycoras , Syrus , Pisus , Marathus , Megarus , \\tPatarus , Acraepheus , Cicon , Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo , under the guidance of his words , founded eponymous cities . \\nHe also had a son named \\tChrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist . \\nHis other daughters include Eurynome , Chariclo wife of Chiron , Eurydice the wife of Orpheus , Eriopis , famous for her beautiful \\thair , Melite the heroine , Pamphile the silk weaver , Parthenos , and by some accounts , Phoebe , Hilyra and Scylla . \\nApollo turned Parthenos into a \\tconstellation after her early death . \\nAdditionally , Apollo fostered and educated Chiron , the centaur who later became \\tthe greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including Apollo 's sons . \\nApollo also fostered Carnus , the \\tson of Zeus and Europa . \\nFailed love \\tattempts . \\nMarpessa was kidnapped by Idas but \\twas loved by Apollo as well . \\nZeus made her choose between them , and she chose Idas on the grounds \\tthat Apollo , being immortal , would tire of her when she grew old . \\nSinope , a nymph , was \\tapproached by the amorous Apollo . \\nShe made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask \\tfor , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin . \\nApollo kept his promise \\tand went back . \\nBolina was admired by Apollo but she \\trefused him and jumped into the sea . \\nTo avoid her death , Apollo turned her \\tinto a nymph , saving her life . \\nCastalia was a nymph \\twhom Apollo loved . \\nShe fled from him and dove into the spring \\tat Delphi , at the base of Mt . \\nParnassos , which was \\tthen named after her . \\nWater from this spring was sacred ; it was used \\tto clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses . \\nCassandra , was a daughter \\tof Hecuba and Priam . \\nApollo wished to \\tcourt her . \\nCassandra promised to return his love on one condition - \\the should give her the power to see the future . \\nApollo fulfilled her wish , but she went back \\ton her word and rejected him soon after . \\nAngered that she broke her promise , Apollo cursed her that even though \\tshe would see the future , no one would ever believe her prophecies . \\nHestia , the goddess of the hearth , rejected both Apollo 's and \\tPoseidon 's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried . \\nFemale \\tcounterparts . \\nArtemis \\t. \\nArtemis as the sister of Apollo , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , \\tshe as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity . \\nIn the pre-Hellenic period , their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife , \\tand there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo . \\nHowever , this relationship was never sexual but spiritual , which is \\twhy they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period . \\nArtemis , like her brother , is \\tarmed with a bow and arrows . \\nShe is the cause of \\tsudden deaths of women . \\nShe also is the protector of \\tthe young , especially girls . \\nThough she has nothing to do with oracles , music or poetry \\t, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang . \\nThe laurel ( `` daphne '' \\t) was sacred to both . \\n`` Artemis Daphnaia '' had her temple among \\tthe Lacedemonians , at a place called Hypsoi . \\n`` Apollo Daphnephoros '' had a temple in Eretria , a \\t`` place where the citizens are to take the oaths '' . \\nIn later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun \\tor Helios , Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon . \\nHecate \\t. \\nHecate , the goddess of witchcraft and magic \\t, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo . \\nThey both are cousins , since their mothers \\t- Leto and Asteria - are sisters . \\nOne of Apollo 's epithets , `` Hecatos '' , is the masculine form \\tof Hecate , and both the names mean `` working from afar '' . \\nWhile Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven , \\tHecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness . \\nIf Hecate is the `` gate-keeper '' , Apollo \\t`` Agyieus '' is the `` door-keeper '' . \\nHecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo \\tis the god and protector of streets . \\nThe oldest evidence found for Hecate 's worship \\tis at Apollo 's temple in Miletos . \\nThere , Hecate was taken to be Apollo \\t's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis . \\nHecate 's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and \\tcontrasts and complements , at the same time , Apollo 's solar nature . \\nAthena \\t. \\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power , \\tApollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena . \\nBeing Zeus ' favorite children , they \\twere given more powers and duties . \\nApollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of \\tcities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . \\nAthena was the principle goddess of Athens , \\tApollo was the principle god of Sparta . \\nAs patrons of arts , Apollo and Athena were companions of the \\tMuses , the former a much more frequent companion than the latter . \\nApollo was sometimes called the \\tson of Athena and Hephaestus . \\nIn the Trojan war , as Zeus ' executive , \\tApollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does . \\nApollo 's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena , and they \\tboth worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus . \\nApollo in the \\t`` Oresteia '' . \\nIn Aeschylus ' `` Oresteia '' trilogy , Clytemnestra kills her husband , King Agamemnon \\tbecause he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war . \\nApollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon 's son \\t, Orestes , is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus , her lover . \\nOrestes and Pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently Orestes is \\tpursued by the Erinyes or Furies ( female personifications of vengeance ) . \\nApollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging \\this father , whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage . \\nThey invade his temple , \\tand he drives them away . \\nHe says that the matter \\tshould be brought before Athena . \\nApollo promises to protect Orestes , as \\tOrestes has become Apollo 's supplicant . \\nApollo advocates Orestes at the trial , and \\tultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo . \\nRoman \\tApollo . \\nThe Roman worship of Apollo \\twas adopted from the Greeks . \\nAs a quintessentially Greek god , Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent \\t, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus . \\nThere was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as \\tthe period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus . \\nOn the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE , Apollo 's first temple at Rome was \\testablished in the Flaminian fields , replacing an older cult site there known as the `` Apollinare '' . \\nDuring the Second Punic War in 212 BCE , the `` Ludi Apollinares '' ( `` Apollonian Games \\t'' ) were instituted in his honor , on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius . \\nIn the time of Augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said \\tto be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome . \\nAfter the battle of Actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo , Augustus enlarged Apollo 's \\ttemple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour . \\nHe also erected a new temple to \\tthe god on the Palatine hill . \\nSacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the \\tSecular Games , held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era . \\nFestivals \\t. \\nThe chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years \\tat Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games . \\nAlso of major importance was the Delia \\theld every four years on Delos . \\nAthenian annual festivals included the Boedromia , \\tMetageitnia , Pyanepsia , and Thargelia . \\nSpartan annual festivals were the \\tCarneia and the Hyacinthia . \\nThebes every nine years \\theld the Daphnephoria . \\nAttributes and \\tsymbols . \\nApollo 's most common attributes \\twere the bow and arrow . \\nOther attributes of his included the kithara ( an advanced version \\tof the common lyre ) , the plectrum and the sword . \\nAnother common emblem was the sacrificial \\ttripod , representing his prophetic powers . \\nThe Pythian Games were held in Apollo \\t's honor every four years at Delphi . \\nThe bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and \\tin making the crown of victory at these games . \\nThe palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because \\the had been born under one in Delos . \\nAnimals sacred to Apollo included wolves , dolphins , roe deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing music and song ) , ravens , hawks , crows ( Apollo had hawks \\tand crows as his messengers ) , snakes ( referencing Apollo 's function as the god of prophecy ) , mice and griffins , mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin . \\nHomer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo \\thad a hawk as his messenger . \\nIn many myths Apollo is \\ttransformed into a hawk . \\nIn addition , Claudius Aelianus wrote that in Ancient Egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers \\tof Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called `` hawk-keepers '' ( ἱερακοβοσκοί ) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god . \\nEusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in \\tEgypt and that the city 's symbol is a man with a hawklike face ( Horus ) . \\nClaudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called \\tApollo Horus in their own language . \\nAs god of colonization , Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies \\t, especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 BCE . \\nAccording to Greek tradition , he helped Cretan \\tor Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy . \\nHowever , this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction : Hittite cuneiform texts mention an Asia Minor god called `` Appaliunas '' or `` \\tApalunas '' in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions , which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars . \\nIn this interpretation , Apollo 's title of `` Lykegenes '' can simply be read as `` born in \\tLycia '' , which effectively severs the god 's supposed link with wolves ( possibly a folk etymology ) . \\nIn literary contexts , Apollo represents harmony , order , and reason—characteristics contrasted with \\tthose of Dionysus , god of wine , who represents ecstasy and disorder . \\nThe contrast between the roles of these gods \\tis reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian . \\nHowever , the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary : the two gods are brothers , \\tand when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea , he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus . \\nThis contrast appears to be shown on \\tthe two sides of the Borghese Vase . \\nApollo is often associated \\twith the Golden Mean . \\nThis is the Greek ideal of moderation \\tand a virtue that opposes gluttony . \\nIn antiquity , Apollo was \\tassociated with the planet Mercury . \\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening \\t, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before . \\nThe morning planet was called Apollo , and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they \\twere the same , thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes ' was kept , and 'Apollo ' was dropped . \\nApollo in \\tthe arts . \\nApollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman \\tart and also in the art of the Renaissance . \\nThe earliest Greek word for a statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' \\t) , and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision . \\nGreek art puts into Apollo the highest degree \\tof power and beauty that can be imagined . \\nThe sculptors derived this from observations on human beings , but they also \\tembodied in concrete form , issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought . \\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the \\tcult of the body that was essentially a religious activity . \\nThe muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for \\thealth , and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment . \\nThe statues of Apollo embody beauty , balance and \\tinspire awe before the beauty of the world . \\nArchaic \\tsculpture . \\nNumerous free-standing statues of male youths from Archaic Greece exist , and were once thought \\tto be representations of Apollo , though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals . \\nIn 1895 , V. I. Leonardos proposed the term `` kouros '' ( `` male youth '' ) to refer to \\tthose from Keratea ; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format . \\nThe earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two \\tfigures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos . \\nSuch statues were found across the Greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries \\tof Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of `` Apollo Ptoios '' , Boeotia alone . \\nSignificantly more rare are \\tthe life-sized bronze statues . \\nOne of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was \\tdescribed as `` a miracle '' by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze , `` Piraeus Apollo '' . \\nIt was found in Piraeus , a port city close to \\tAthens , and is believed to have come from north-eastern Peloponnesus . \\nIt is the only \\tsurviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue . \\nClassical \\tsculpture . \\nThe famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type , in \\twhich the god holds the cithara , a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre , in his left arm . \\nWhile none of the Greek originals have survived , several Roman \\tcopies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist . \\nOther notable forms are the Apollo \\tCitharoedus and the Apollo Barberini . \\nHellenistic \\tGreece-Rome . \\nApollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a cithara ( as Apollo Citharoedus ) or \\tbow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types ) . \\nThe Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for centuries \\tit epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans , from the Renaissance through the 19th century . \\nThe marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original \\tby the Greek sculptor Leochares , made between 350 and 325 BCE . \\nThe life-size so-called `` Adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of a `` villa suburbana '' \\tnear the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars . \\nIn the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem , Roman `` Thysdrus '' , he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo \\t, though now even a god 's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak , a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire . \\nAnother haloed Apollo in mosaic , from Hadrumentum \\t, is in the museum at Sousse . \\nThe conventions of this representation , head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling hair cut \\tin locks grazing the neck , were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great . \\nSome time after this mosaic was executed , the earliest \\tdepictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed . \\nModern \\treception . \\nApollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his \\tstatus as the god of music , dance and poetry . \\nPostclassical art \\tand literature . \\nDance and \\tmusic . \\nApollo has featured in dance \\tand music in modern culture . \\nPercy Bysshe Shelley composed a `` Hymn of Apollo '' ( 1820 ) , and the god 's \\tinstruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky 's `` Apollon musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . \\nIn 1978 , the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs `` Apollo \\t: Bringer of Wisdom '' / '' Dionysus : Bringer of Love '' . \\nBooks \\t. \\nApollo been portrayed in modern literature , such as when Charles Handy , in `` Gods of Management \\t'' ( 1978 ) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture . \\nApollo represents a 'role ' culture where \\torder , reason , and bureaucracy prevail . \\nIn 2016 , author Rick Riordan published the first book in the Trials of Apollo series \\t, publishing four other books in the series in 2017 , 2018 , 2019 and 2020 . \\nFilm \\t. \\nApollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance , by Keith David in the 1997 animated feature film `` Hercules , '' by Luke \\tEvans in the 2010 action film `` Clash of the Titans '' , and by Dimitri Lekkos in the 2010 film `` '' . \\nVideo \\tgames . \\nApollo has appeared in \\tmany modern video games . \\nApollo appears as a minor character in Santa Monica Studio 's 2010 action-adventure game \\t`` God of War III '' with his bow being used by Peirithous . \\nHe also appears in the 2014 Hi-Rez Studios Multiplayer Online \\tBattle Arena game `` Smite '' as a playable character . \\nPsychology and \\tphilosophy . \\nIn philosophical discussion of the arts , a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian \\timpulses , where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity . \\nFriedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion \\tof the two was most desirable . \\nPsychologist Carl Jung 's Apollo archetype represents what he saw as \\tthe disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance . \\nSpaceflight \\t. \\nIn spaceflight , the 1960s and 1970s NASA program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the Moon was named after Apollo , by NASA manager Abe Silverstein : < /doc > < doc id= '' \\t595 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=595 '' title= '' Andre Agassi '' > Andre Agassi Andre Kirk Agassi ( ; born April 29 , 1970 ) is an American former world No . \\n1 tennis \\tplayer . \\nHe is an eight-time major champion and an Olympic gold medalist \\t, as well as a runner-up in seven other majors . \\nAgassi is the second of five men to achieve the career Grand Slam in \\tthe Open Era and the fifth of eight overall to make the achievement . \\nHe is also the first of two men to achieve the career Golden Slam ( career Grand Slam and Olympic gold medal ) , as well \\tas the only man to win a career Super Slam ( career Grand Slam , plus the Olympic gold medal and the year-end championships ) . \\nAgassi was the first man to win all four singles majors on three different surfaces ( hard , clay and grass ) , and \\tremains the most recent American man to win the French Open ( in 1999 ) and the Australian Open ( in 2003 ) . \\nHe also won 17 Masters titles and was part of the \\twinning Davis Cup teams in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 . \\nAgassi reached the \\tworld No . \\n1 ranking for the first time in 1995 , but was troubled \\tby personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to No . \\n141 in 1997 , prompting many to \\tbelieve that his career was over . \\nAgassi returned \\tto No . \\n1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run \\tof his career over the next four years . \\nDuring his 20-plus year tour career , Agassi was \\tknown by the nickname `` The Punisher '' . \\nAfter suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis ( vertebral displacement ) and a bone spur that interfered \\twith the nerve , Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3 , 2006 , after losing in the third round of the US Open . \\nHe is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation , which \\thas raised over $ 60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada . \\nIn 2001 , the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy \\tin Las Vegas , a K–12 public charter school for at-risk children . \\nHe has been married to fellow \\ttennis player Steffi Graf since 2001 . \\nEarly \\tlife . \\nAndre Agassi was born in Las Vegas , Nevada , to Emmanuel `` Mike '' Agassi ( Aghassian ) \\t, a former Olympic boxer from Iran and American Elizabeth `` Betty '' Agassi ( née Dudley ) . \\nHis father is of \\tArmenian and Assyrian heritage . \\nAndre Agassi 's mother , Betty \\t, is a breast cancer survivor . \\nHe has three older siblings – Rita ( last wife of \\tformer number one Pancho Gonzales ) , Philip and Tami . \\nAndre was given the middle name Kirk after \\tKirk Kerkorian , an Armenian American billionaire . \\nEmmanuel Agassi , then a waiter at Tropicana \\tLas Vegas , had met Kerkorian in 1963 . \\nAt the age of 12 , Agassi and his good friend and doubles partner , \\tRoddy Parks , won the 1982 National Indoor Boys 14s Doubles Championship in Chicago . \\nAgassi describes memorable experiences and juvenile pranks with \\tRoddy in his book `` Open '' . \\nWhen he was 13 , Agassi was sent \\tto Nick Bollettieri 's Tennis Academy in Florida . \\nHe was meant to stay for only three months \\t, because that was all his father could afford . \\nAfter thirty minutes of watching Agassi play , Bollettieri , deeply impressed by \\this talent , called Mike and said : `` Take your check back . \\nHe 's here \\tfor free . '' \\nAgassi then dropped out of school in the \\tninth grade to pursue a full-time tennis career . \\nProfessional \\tcareer . \\n1986–1993 : Breakthrough and \\tthe first major title . \\nAgassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed \\tin his first tournament at La Quinta , California . \\nHe won his first match against John Austin , \\tbut then lost his second match to Mats Wilander . \\nBy the end of 1986 \\t, Agassi was ranked No . \\n91 \\t. \\nHe won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the \\tSul American Open in Itaparica and ended the year ranked No . \\n25 \\t. \\nHe won six additional tournaments in 1988 ( Memphis , U.S. Men 's Clay Court Championships , Forest Hills WCT , Stuttgart Outdoor , Volvo International and Livingston Open ) , and \\t, by December of that year , he had surpassed US $ 1 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level . \\nDuring 1988 , he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager \\t( a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005 ) . \\nHis year-end ranking \\twas No . \\n3 , behind second-ranked Ivan \\tLendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander . \\nBoth the Association of Tennis Professionals and `` Tennis '' magazine \\tnamed Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988 . \\nIn addition to not playing the Australian Open ( which later became his best Grand Slam event ) for the first eight years of his career , Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through \\t1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event 's traditionalism , particularly its `` predominantly white '' dress code to which players at the event are required to conform . \\nStrong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was \\tquickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion . \\nWhile still a teenager , he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open \\tand the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semi-finals in 1989 . \\nHe began the 1990s with \\ta series of near-misses . \\nHe reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open , where he was favored before losing in four \\tsets to Andrés Gómez , which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match . \\nHe reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the \\tUS Open , defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semi-finals . \\nHis opponent in the final was Pete Sampras ; a year earlier , Agassi had crushed Sampras , after which time \\the told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro . \\nAgassi lost the US Open final \\tto Sampras in three sets . \\nThe Agassi-Sampras rivalry became the biggest one in \\ttennis over the rest of the decade . \\nAgassi ended 1990 on a high note as he helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in \\t8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup , beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final . \\nIn 1991 , Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final \\t, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier . \\nCourier emerged the victor \\tin a five-set final . \\nAgassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991 , leading to weeks \\tof speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear . \\nHe eventually emerged for the first \\tround in a completely white outfit . \\nHe reached the quarterfinals on that occasion , \\tlosing in five sets to David Wheaton . \\nAgassi 's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon , not at the \\tFrench Open or the US Open , where he had previously enjoyed success . \\nIn 1992 , he defeated Goran \\tIvanišević in a five-set final . \\nAlong the way , Agassi overcame two former \\tWimbledon champions : Boris Becker and John McEnroe . \\nNo other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon \\tuntil Lleyton Hewitt ten years later . \\nAgassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports \\tPersonality of the Year in 1992 . \\nAgassi once again played on the United States \\t' Davis Cup winning team in 1992 . \\nIt was their second Davis \\tcup title in three years . \\nAgassi famously played the game wearing Oakley brand sunglasses , and a photo of \\thim from the day appeared on the cover of `` Tennis '' magazine . \\nIn his memoir , he wrote that he was covering up bloodshot eyes from a hangover and claimed that the \\tfounder of Oakley , Jim Jannard , had sent him a Dodge Viper to thank him for the inadvertent publicity . \\nIn 1993 , Agassi won the only doubles title of his \\tcareer , at the Cincinnati Masters , partnered with Petr Korda . \\nHe missed much of the early part \\tof that year due to injuries . \\nAlthough he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title \\tdefense , he lost to eventual champion and No . \\n1 Pete Sampras \\tin five sets . \\nAgassi lost in the first round at the US Open to \\tThomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year . \\n1994–1997 : Rise to the top \\t, Olympic Gold and the fall . \\nWith new coach Brad Gilbert on board , Agassi began to employ \\tmore of a tactical , consistent approach , which fueled his resurgence . \\nHe started slowly in 1994 , losing in the \\tfirst week at the French Open and Wimbledon . \\nNevertheless , he emerged during the hard-court \\tseason , winning the Canadian Open . \\nHis comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open \\twith a five-set fourth-round victory against Michael Chang . \\nHe then became the first man to capture the US Open \\tas an unseeded player , beating Michael Stich in the final . \\nAlong the way , he \\tbeat 5 seeded players . \\nIn 1995 , Agassi shaved his balding head , breaking \\twith his old `` image is everything '' style . \\nHe competed in the 1995 Australian Open ( his first appearance at the \\tevent ) and won , beating defending champion Sampras in a four-set final . \\nAgassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995 \\t, all on hardcourt , with Agassi winning three . \\nAgassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ( Cincinnati , Key \\tBiscayne , and the Canadian Open ) and seven titles total . \\nHe compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit , with the last \\tvictory being in an intense late-night four-set semi-final of the US Open against Boris Becker . \\nThe streak ended the next day when \\tAgassi lost the final to Sampras . \\nAgassi admitted this loss , which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their \\thead-to-head meetings , took two years for him to get over it mentally . \\nAgassi reached the \\tworld No . \\n1 ranking for the first \\ttime in April 1995 . \\nHe held that ranking until November , \\tfor a total of 30 weeks . \\nAgassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which \\tallowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked No . \\n1 at the \\tyear-end ranking . \\nIn terms of win–loss record , \\t1995 was Agassi 's best year . \\nHe won 73 and lost 9 matches , and was also once again a key player on \\tthe United States ' Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of his career . \\n1996 was a less successful year for Agassi , \\tas he failed to reach any Grand Slam final . \\nHe suffered two early-round losses to Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon \\t, respectively , and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi-finals . \\nAt the time , Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions , but later said in his biography that he had \\tlost the match on purpose , as he did not want to play Boris Becker , whom he would have faced in that final . \\nThe high point for Agassi was winning the men 's singles gold medal at \\tthe Olympic Games in Atlanta , beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final . \\nAgassi also successfully defended his singles \\ttitles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne . \\n1997 was the low point \\tof Agassi 's career . \\nHis wrist injury resurfaced , and he \\tplayed only 24 matches during the year . \\nHe later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at \\tthat time , allegedly on the urging of a friend . \\nHe failed an ATP drug test , but wrote a \\tletter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink . \\nThe ATP dropped the failed \\tdrug test as a warning . \\nIn his autobiography , Agassi admitted \\tthat the letter was a lie . \\nHe quit the \\tdrug soon after . \\nAt this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress , \\tmodel , and socialite Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game . \\nHe won no top-level titles , \\tand his ranking sank to No . \\n141 on November 10 , 1997 , prompting many to believe that his run as one of \\tthe sport 's premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships . \\n1998–2003 : Return to glory \\tand Career Super Slam . \\nIn 1998 , Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by \\tplaying in Challenger Series tournaments , a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world 's top 50 . \\nAfter returning to top physical and mental shape , Agassi recorded the most successful period of his \\ttennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter . \\nIn 1998 , Agassi won five \\ttitles and leapt from No . \\n110 to \\tNo . \\n6 , the highest jump into the top 10 \\tmade by any player during a calendar year . \\nAt Wimbledon , he had an early loss \\tin the second round to Tommy Haas . \\nHe won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series \\ttournament in Key Biscayne , losing to Marcelo Ríos , who became No . \\n1 as \\ta result . \\nAt the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for \\tthe second time in his career ( the first being 10 years earlier in 1988 ) . \\nAgassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final , becoming , at the time , only the fifth male player \\t( joining Rod Laver , Fred Perry , Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic ) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career . \\nOnly Laver , Agassi , Federer , Nadal and \\tDjokovic have achieved this feat during the Open Era . \\nThis win also made him the first ( of only four , the next being Federer , Nadal and Djokovic respectively ) male \\tplayer in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces ( clay , grass and hard courts ) . \\nAgassi also became the only male player to win the Career Super Slam , consisting of \\tall four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year-end championship . \\nAgassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon \\tfinal , where he lost to Sampras in straight sets . \\nHe rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open , beating Todd Martin in \\tfive sets ( rallying from a two sets to one deficit ) in the final . \\nOverall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and \\tthe ATP Masters Series in Paris , where he beat Marat Safin . \\nAgassi ended 1999 \\tas the No . \\n1 , ending Sampras 's record of six \\tconsecutive year-ending top rankings ( 1993–98 ) . \\nThis was the only time Agassi \\tended the year at No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi was runner-up to Sampras at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup losing 1–6 \\t, 5–7 , 4–6 despite beating Sampras in the round-robin 6–2 , 6–2 . \\nHe began the next year 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title , \\tbeating Sampras in a five-set semi-final and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final . \\nHe was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand \\tSlam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969 . \\nAt the time , Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events , missing only the Wimbledon title .. 2000 \\talso saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon , where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon . \\nAt the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon , Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat \\tSafin in the semi-finals to end the Russian 's hopes to become the youngest No . \\n1 in the \\thistory of tennis . \\nAgassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final \\t, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open \\ttitle with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément . \\nEn route , he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a \\tsell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie 's last Australian Open . \\nAt Wimbledon , they met again in the semi-finals , where Agassi \\tlost another close match to Rafter , 8–6 in the fifth set . \\nIn the quarterfinals at the US Open , Agassi lost a 3-hour , 33 minute epic match with Sampras \\t, 7–6 , 6–7 , 6–7 , 6–7 , with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match . \\nDespite the setback , Agassi \\tfinished 2001 ranked No . \\n3 , becoming the only male tennis player to finish a \\tyear ranked in the top 3 in three different decades . \\n2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi , as injury forced him to \\tskip the Australian Open , where he was a two-time defending champion . \\nAgassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key \\tBiscayne title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final . \\nAt the US Open , Agassi overcame No.1 ranked \\tand defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals . \\nThis led to what turned out to be the last duel between Agassi and Sampras in final of the US \\tOpen , which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings . \\nThe match was the last \\tof Sampras 's career . \\nAgassi 's US Open finish , along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne \\t, Rome and Madrid , helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end No . \\n2 at 32 years \\tand 8 months . \\nIn 2003 , Agassi won the eighth ( and final ) Grand Slam title of his career \\tat the Australian Open , where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final . \\nOn April 28 , 2003 \\t, he recaptured the No . \\n1 ranking to become the oldest top-ranked male player since \\tthe ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days . \\nThe record was later surpassed \\tby Roger Federer in 2018 . \\nHe had held \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking for two weeks , when Lleyton Hewitt \\ttook it back on May 12 , 2003 . \\nAgassi then recaptured \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking once again on June 16 , 2003 , which \\the held for 12 weeks until September 7 , 2003 . \\nThere he managed to reach the US Open semi-finals , where \\the lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero , surrendering his No . \\n1 ranking \\tto him . \\nDuring his career , Agassi held the \\tranking for a total of 101 weeks . \\nAgassi 's ranking slipped when injuries forced him \\tto withdraw from a number of events . \\nAt the year-end Tennis Masters Cup , Agassi lost in the final to Federer , his third time to \\tfinish as runner-up in the event after losses in 1999 and 2000 , and finished the year ranked No . \\n4 \\t. \\nAt age 33 , he had been one of the oldest players to rank \\tin the top 5 since Connors , at age 35 , was No . \\n4 in \\t1987 . \\n2004–2006 : \\tFinal years . \\nIn 2004 , Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semi-finals of the Australian \\tOpen to Marat Safin ; the loss ended Agassi 's 26-match winning streak at the event . \\nHe won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP \\tMasters Series titles , having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg . \\nAt 34 , he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history ( the tournament began in 1899 ) , \\ttied with Roger Federer and surpassed only by Ken Rosewall , who won the title in 1970 at age 35 . \\nHe finished the \\tyear ranked No . \\n8 , one of the oldest players to finish in \\tthe top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was No . \\n7 in \\t1988 . \\nAt the time , Agassi also became the sixth male player during the open era to reach \\t800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles . \\nAgassi 's 2005 began with a quarterfinal \\tloss to Federer at the Australian Open . \\nAgassi had several other deep runs at tournaments , but \\thad to withdraw from several events due to injury . \\nHe lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the \\tfirst round of the French Open . \\nHe won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the \\tfinal of the Rogers Cup , before falling to No . \\n2 Rafael \\tNadal . \\nAgassi 's 2005 was defined by an \\timprobable run to the US Open final . \\nAfter beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in \\tfour sets , Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final . \\nThe most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake , \\twhere he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker . \\nHis other five-set victories were on Xavier Malisse in \\tthe fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semi-finals . \\nIn the final , Agassi faced Federer , who was seeking his second \\tconsecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years . \\nFederer defeated Agassi \\tin four sets . \\nAgassi finished 2005 \\tranked No . \\n7 , his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings , which tied Connors \\tfor the most times ranked in the top 10 at year 's end . \\nAgassi had a poor start to 2006 , as he was still recovering from an \\tankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play . \\nAgassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury , and his back injury and other pains \\tforced him to withdraw from several other events , eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open . \\nThis caused his ranking to drop out of \\tthe top 10 for the last time . \\nAgassi returned for the grass-court season , \\tplaying a tune-up , and then Wimbledon . \\nHe was defeated in the \\tthird round by world No . \\n2 ( and eventual \\trunner-up ) Rafael Nadal . \\nAgainst conventions , Agassi , the losing player \\t, was interviewed on court after the match . \\nAt Wimbledon , Agassi announced his plans \\tto retire following the US Open . \\nAgassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide \\tClassic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile , which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open . \\nAgassi had a short , but dramatic \\t, run in his final US Open . \\nBecause of extreme back pain , Agassi was \\tforced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match . \\nAfter a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel , Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the \\tsecond round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semi-finals . \\nAgassi won in five tough sets as the younger \\tBaghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set . \\nIn his last match , Agassi fell to 112th-ranked \\tbig-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets . \\nAgassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd \\tafter the match and delivered a retirement speech . \\nRivalries \\t. \\nAgassi vs. \\tSampras . \\nThe rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the \\t1990s , as Sampras and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade . \\nThey also had very contrasting playing styles , with Sampras being considered \\tthe greatest server and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time . \\nAgassi and Sampras met 34 times on \\tthe tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20 . \\nThe 1990 US Open was their first \\tmeeting in a Grand Slam tournament final . \\nAgassi was favored as \\the was ranked No . \\n4 at the time , \\tcompared to the No . \\n12 ranking of Sampras and because Agassi had \\tdefeated Sampras in their only previously completed match . \\nAgassi , however , lost the \\tfinal to Sampras in straight sets . \\nTheir next meeting in a Grand Slam was at the \\t1992 French Open , where they met in the quarterfinals . \\nAlthough Sampras was ranked higher , Agassi \\tcame out winning in straight sets . \\nThey met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993 \\t, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No . \\n1 \\t. \\nAgassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole , levelling the match at two sets apiece ; \\thowever , Sampras prevailed in five sets , and went on to win his first Wimbledon championship . \\nWith both Sampras and Agassi participating , the \\tUS won the Davis Cup in 1995 . \\nThe year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles , meeting \\teach other twice in the finals , and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year . \\nThey met five times during the year , all in the title matches , including the Australian Open , the Newsweek Champions Cup ( \\tnow Indian Wells ) , the Lipton International Players Championships ( now Miami Open ) , the Canadian Open , and the US Open . \\nAgassi won three of the finals , including the Australian Open ; however , \\tSampras took the US Open title , ending Agassi 's 26-match winning streak . \\nAfter Agassi had taken most of the fall \\tseason off , Sampras took over the No . \\n1 ranking for the \\tend of the season . \\nAgassi admitted this loss , which gave Sampras a 9–8 lead in their \\thead-to-head meetings , took two years for him to get over it mentally . \\nIn the following three years , while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles \\tevery season , Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions . \\nThe next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final \\twas at Wimbledon in 1999 , where Sampras won in straight sets . \\nFor both , it was considered a career rejuvenation , as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in \\tthe previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open . \\nSampras forfeited \\tthe No . \\n1 ranking to Agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that \\tyear 's US Open , which Agassi went on to win . \\nThey faced each other twice in the season-ending ATP Tour World Championships \\t, with Sampras losing the round-robin match , but winning the final . \\nIn the 2000s , they met three more times \\ton the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests . \\nIn 2000 , the \\ttop-ranked Agassi defeated No . \\n3 Sampras in the semi-finals of the Australian Open in five sets , which was an \\timportant win for Agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against Sampras . \\nIn arguably their most memorable match ever , Sampras defeated \\tAgassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals in four sets . \\nThere were no breaks of \\tserve during the entire match . \\nReruns of the match are frequently featured on television , especially during US Open rain delays , and the \\tmatch is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players . \\nTheir last meeting was the final of the 2002 US Open , which was \\ttheir third meeting in a US Open final , but the first since 1995 . \\nThe match was also notable because they had defeated \\tseveral up-and-coming players en route to the final . \\nSampras had \\tdefeated No . \\n3 Tommy Haas in the \\tfourth round and future No . \\n1 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals \\t, while Agassi had defeated No . \\n1 and defending champion Lleyton \\tHewitt in the semi-finals . \\nSampras defeated Agassi \\tin four sets . \\nThis was the final ATP tour \\tsingles match of Sampras 's career . \\nAgassi vs. \\tChang . \\nMichael Chang was the opponent Agassi faced most \\tfrequently from all the players other than Sampras . \\nThey met 22 times on the \\ttour level with Agassi leading 15–7 . \\nChang , unlike most of Agassi 's big rivals \\t, had a playing style similar to his . \\nBoth players preferred to stay at the \\tbaseline with Chang being more defensive-minded . \\nThe outcome was that most of their meetings \\twere built on long and entertaining rallies . \\nThe rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of \\tthe next great generation of American tennis players and both being of foreign descent . \\nAgassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 US Open \\tand defeating Chang , the defending champion , in the 1990 French Open in a four-set quarterfinal . \\nArguably their best match took place in the \\tround of 16 of the 1994 US Open . \\nWhile both players presented high-quality shot-making , the momentum changed from \\tset to set with Agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory . \\nIt turned out to be the toughest contest on \\this way to his first US Open title . \\nTheir next two Grand Slam meetings came in 1996 , with Chang recording easy \\tstraight-set victories in the semi-finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open . \\nYears after , Agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on \\tpurpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker , who was awaiting the winner in the final . \\nAgassi won the last four of their matches , with the last being \\tin 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly past his prime . \\nAgassi vs. \\tBecker . \\nBoris Becker and Agassi played 14 \\ttimes with Agassi leading 10–4 . \\nBecker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Agassi reversed \\tthe rivalry in 1990 , and won 10 of their last 11 matches . \\nThey first played at Indian Wells \\tin 1988 , with Becker prevailing . \\nTheir most notable match was the 1989 Davis Cup semi-final match , which \\tBecker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks . \\nAgassi , considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass , shocked Becker , a three-time champion \\t, in a five-set quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first Grand Slam title . \\nThe intensity of the \\trivalry peaked in 1995 . \\nBecker won that year 's Wimbledon semi-final after being down a \\tset and two breaks , to eventually win in four sets . \\nIn a highly anticipated rematch in the US Open semi-final , this \\ttime it was Agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets . \\nTheir final match was played at Hong Kong in \\t1999 , which Agassi won in three sets . \\nAgassi vs. \\tRafter . \\nAgassi and Pat Rafter played fifteen \\ttimes with Agassi leading 10–5 . \\nThe rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters , because of the players ' contrasting styles of play , with Rafter \\tusing traditional serve- & amp ; -volley methods against Agassi 's variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons . \\nAgassi led 8–2 on hard courts , but Rafter surprisingly won \\ttheir sole match on clay at the 1999 Rome Masters . \\nThey played four matches at Wimbledon \\twith both winning two matches each . \\nAgassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999 , while Rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters , \\tthe latter two matches being gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played . \\nAgassi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open , in 1995 \\tand 2001 , on his way to the title on both occasions . \\nRafter , however , took their only US Open encounter \\tin 1997 and went on to win the title . \\nAgassi vs. \\tFederer . \\nAgassi and Roger Federer played 11 times , \\tand Federer led their head-to-head series 8–3 . \\nWith the retirement of Sampras , the rivalry against the 11-years-younger Federer , who was another great \\tserver like Sampras , became Agassi 's main rivalry for the final years of his career . \\nAgassi won their first three matches , but \\tthen went on to lose eight consecutive ones . \\nThey first met in just the third tournament of Federer 's career at the \\t1998 Swiss Indoors in Federer 's hometown , with Agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old . \\nAgassi also defeated Federer at the 2001 US Open \\tand the finals of the Miami Open in 2002 . \\nFederer began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003 \\t, when he defeated Agassi in both the round-robin and the final . \\nThey played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open that spanned \\tover two windy days , with Federer eventually prevailing in five sets . \\nAt the 2005 Dubai Championships , Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the \\ttwo tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Burj al-Arab . \\nTheir final duel took place in the \\tfinal of the 2005 US Open . \\nIn the historic clash of generations , Federer was victorious \\tin four sets in front of a pro-Agassi crowd . \\nThe match was the last appearance \\tby Agassi in any tournament final . \\nAgassi vs. \\tLendl . \\nAgassi and Ivan Lendl played eight times , \\tand Lendl led their head-to-head series 6–2 . \\nAgassi vs. \\tEdberg . \\nAgassi and Stefan Edberg played nine times , \\tand Agassi led their head-to-head series 6–3 . \\nEarnings \\t. \\nAgassi earned more than $ 30 million in prize-money during his career , sixth only to \\tDjokovic , Federer , Nadal , Sampras and Murray to date ( May 2018 ) . \\nHe also earned more than $ 25 million a year through endorsements during \\this career , which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time . \\nPost-retirement \\t. \\nSince retiring after the 2006 US Open , Agassi has participated in a \\tseries of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity . \\nOn September 5 , 2007 , he was a surprise \\tguest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open quarterfinal . \\nHe played an exhibition match at Wimbledon , teaming with his wife \\t, Steffi Graf , to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters . \\nHe played World Team Tennis for the \\tPhiladelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009 . \\nAt the 2009 French Open , Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer , who completed his Career Grand Slam by \\twinning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam , with the trophy . \\nAlso in 2009 , Agassi played at the \\tOutback Champions Series event for the first time . \\nHe played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships at Surprise , Arizona \\t, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin . \\nAgassi returned to the tour renamed for the PowerShares Series in 2011 \\tand participated in a total of seven events while winning two . \\nAgassi beat Courier in the final of the Staples Champions Cup in Boston \\tand later defeated Sampras at the CTCA Championships at his hometown Las Vegas . \\nIn 2012 , Agassi took part in \\tfive tournaments , winning three of those . \\nIn November , at first he won BILT Champions Showdown \\tin San Jose , beating John McEnroe in the final . \\nThe following day , he defended his title of the \\tCTCA Championships , while defeating Courier in the decisive match . \\nIn the series season finale , he beat \\tMichael Chang for the Acura Champions Cup . \\nThe series and Agassi came \\tback to action in 2014 . \\nAgassi won both tournaments \\the participated in . \\nAt the Camden Wealth Advisors Cup 's final in Houston , Agassi \\tbeat James Blake for a rematch of their 2005 US Open quarterfinal . \\nHe defeated Blake again in Portland to win the \\ttitle of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championships . \\nIn 2015 , Agassi took part in just one event of the PowerShares \\tSeries , losing to Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Champions Shootout . \\nThe following year he took part in two events , at first losing to Blake in \\tChicago , and the next day defeating Mardy Fish , but losing to Roddick in Charleston . \\nIn 2009 , in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the \\tfirst time on court since the 2002 US Open final . \\nSampras won the exhibition \\tin three sets . \\nThe rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in \\tthe `` Hit for Haiti '' charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake . \\nPartnered with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , the old rivals began making jokes at each other \\t's expense , which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassi 's body . \\nAfter the event , Agassi admitted that he had crossed \\tthe line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras . \\nAgassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden \\tin New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets . \\nOn March 3 , 2014 , Agassi and Sampras squared off \\tfor an exhibition in London for the annual World Tennis Day . \\nThis time , it was Agassi who came \\tout on top in two straight sets . \\nHe returned to the tour in May 2017 in the \\tposition of coach to Novak Djokovic for the French Open . \\nAgassi announced the end of the partnership on March 31 , 2018 \\t, stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship . \\nPlaying \\tstyle . \\nEarly in his career , Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis , typically by inducing \\ta weak return with a deep , hard shot , and then playing a winner at an extreme angle . \\nOn the rare occasion that he charged the net , Agassi liked to take \\tthe ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner . \\nHis favored groundstroke was his flat , accurate two-handed backhand \\t, hit well cross-court but especially down the line . \\nHis forehand was nearly as strong , \\tespecially his inside-out to the ad court . \\nAgassi 's strength was in dictating play from the baseline , and \\the was able to consistently take the ball on the rise . \\nWhile he was growing up , his father \\tand Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way . \\nWhen in control of a point , Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner \\tand hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors , and to make his opponent run more . \\nThis change to more methodical , less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by \\this longtime coach , Brad Gilbert , in their first year together in 1994 . \\nGilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep , flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to \\twin attrition wars , and noted Agassi 's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot . \\nA signature play later in his career was a change-up \\tdrop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes . \\nThis would often be followed by a passing shot or \\tlob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it . \\nAgassi was raised on hardcourts , but found much of his early major-tournament success on the \\tred clay of Roland Garros , reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career . \\nDespite grass being his worst surface , his first major win was at the slick grass \\tof Wimbledon in 1992 , a tournament that he professed to hating at the time . \\nHis strongest surface over the course of his career , was \\tindeed hardcourt , where he won six of his eight majors . \\nBusiness \\tventures . \\nAgassi established a limited liability company named Andre \\tAgassi Ventures ( formerly named Agassi Enterprises ) . \\nAgassi , along with five athlete partners ( including Wayne Gretzky , Joe Montana , Shaquille O'Neal , Ken Griffey \\tJr. , and Monica Seles ) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996 . \\nThe restaurant closed \\tdown in 2001 . \\nIn 1999 , he paid $ 1 million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank \\tand made a $ 10 million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006 . \\nIn 2002 , he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers \\tand cable and satellite industry , and made an equity investment in the network . \\nAfter meeting chef Michael Mina at one of his restaurants in San Francisco , Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina \\tGroup Inc. and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco , San Jose , Dana Point , Atlantic City and Las Vegas . \\nAgassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas \\tand Golden Nugget Laughlin from MGM Mirage for $ 215 million in 2004 . \\nOne year later , the group sold the hotel-casino to Landry 's , Inc. \\tfor $ 163 million in cash and $ 182 million in assumed debt . \\nIn 2007 , he sat on the board of \\tMeadows Bank , an independent bank in Nevada . \\nHe has invested in start-up companies backed \\tby Allen & amp ; Company . \\nAgassi and Graf formed a \\tcompany called Agassi Graf Holdings . \\nThey invested in PURE , a nightclub at Caesars Palace , which opened \\tin 2004 , and sold it to Angel Management Group in 2010 . \\nIn August 2006 , Agassi and Graf developed a \\tjoint venture with high-end furniture maker Kreiss Enterprises . \\nThey launched a furniture line \\tcalled Agassi Graf Collection . \\nIn September , Agassi and Graf , through their company Agassi Graf Development LLC , along with Bayview Financial LP \\t, finalized an agreement to develop a condominium hotel , Fairmont Tamarack , at Tamarack Resort in Donnelly , Idaho . \\nOwing to difficult market conditions and delays , \\tthey withdrew from the project in 2009 . \\nThe group still owns three \\tsmall chunks of land . \\nIn September , they collaborated with Steve Case 's Exclusive Resorts \\tto co-develop luxury resorts and design Agassi-Graf Tennis and Fitness Centers . \\nThey also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and \\tboth serve as board members and advisors of the company . \\nIn October 2012 , Village Roadshow and investors including Agassi and Graf announced plans \\tto build a new water park called Wet'n'Wild Las Vegas in Las Vegas . \\nVillage Roadshow has a 51 % stake in the park while Agassi \\t, Graf , and other private investors hold the remaining 49 % . \\nThe park opened \\tin May 2013 . \\nIMG managed Agassi from the time he turned pro in \\t1986 through January 2000 before switching to SFX Sports Group . \\nHis business manager , lawyer and agent was childhood friend \\tPerry Rogers , but they have been estranged since 2008 . \\nIn 2009 , he and \\tGraf signed with CAA . \\nEquipment and \\tendorsements . \\nAgassi used Prince Graphite rackets \\tearly in his career . \\nHe signed a $ 7 million endorsement \\tcontract with Belgian tennis racquet makers Donnay . \\nHe later switched to Head Ti Radical racket and Head 's LiquidMetal Radical \\tracket , having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Head in 1993 . \\nHe renewed his contract in 1999 , and in \\tNovember 2003 he signed a lifetime agreement with Head . \\nHe also endorses \\tPenn tennis balls . \\nOn July 25 , 2005 , Agassi left Nike after \\t17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas . \\nA major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to \\tAgassi 's charities , and Adidas was more

Shorto 's `` Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary '' . \\nLittle work has been done on the Munda \\tlanguages , which are not well documented . \\nWith their demotion from a primary branch \\t, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2005 ) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer \\tas follows : This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for . \\nis better preserved in the Katuic languages \\t, which Sidwell has specialized in . \\nInternal \\tclassification . \\nLinguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic : the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia , Northeast India and the \\tNicobar Islands , and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh , parts of Nepal . \\nHowever , no evidence for this \\tclassification has ever been published . \\nEach of the families that is written in boldface \\ttype below is accepted as a valid clade . \\nBy contrast , the relationships `` between \\t'' these families within Austroasiatic are debated . \\nIn addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposals are given , \\tneither of which accepts traditional `` Mon–Khmer '' as a valid unit . \\nHowever , little of the data used for competing classifications has ever \\tbeen published , and therefore can not be evaluated by peer review . \\nIn addition , there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra ( \\tDiffloth ) , the Chamic languages of Vietnam , and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo ( Adelaar 1995 ) . \\nDiffloth ( \\t1974 ) . \\nDiffloth 's widely cited original classification , now abandoned by Diffloth himself , is used \\tin `` Encyclopædia Britannica '' and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in `` Ethnologue . '' \\nPeiros ( \\t2004 ) . \\nPeiros is a lexicostatistic classification , \\tbased on percentages of shared vocabulary . \\nThis means that languages can appear to be more distantly \\trelated than they actually are due to language contact . \\nIndeed , when Sidwell ( 2009 ) replicated Peiros 's study with languages known well enough \\tto account for loans , he did not find the internal ( branching ) structure below . \\nDiffloth ( \\t2005 ) . \\nDiffloth compares reconstructions of various clades , and attempts to classify them based on \\tshared innovations , though like other classifications the evidence has not been published . \\nAs a schematic , we have : Or \\tin more detail , Sidwell ( 2009–2015 ) . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2009 ) , in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords , finds little evidence for internal branching , though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and \\tKatuic languages , such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches , without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic . \\nHe therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches \\tof Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence . \\nSidwell & amp ; Blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that \\tthere is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node , which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic . \\nIf this would the case , Sidwell & amp ; Blench suggest that \\tKhasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward . \\nSidwell & amp ; Blench ( 2011 ) suggest Shompen as an \\tadditional branch , and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating . \\nIn general , however , the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have \\tdeveloped , since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong river valley relatively quickly . \\nSubsequently , Sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) proposed that Nicobarese subgroups with \\tAslian , just as how Khasian and Palaungic subgroup with each other . \\nA subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis ( Sidwell 2015b ) suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure , with an east–west division ( consisting \\tof Munda , Khasic , Palaungic , and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present . \\nHowever , he still \\tconsiders the subbranching dubious . \\nIntegrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings , Paul Sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into \\tIndochina from the Lingnan area of southern China , with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China . \\nSidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may \\thave begun to split up 5,000 years B.P . \\nduring the Neolithic transition era of mainland Southeast Asia , with \\tall the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P . \\nAustroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the Pearl River watershed of Lingnan , which \\twould have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam , or downstream through the Mekong River via Yunnan . \\nBoth the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record \\tclearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P . \\ncultivated rice and millet , kept livestock such as dogs , pigs , \\tand chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments . \\nAt 4,500 B.P. , this `` Neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal \\tgrains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures , with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P . \\nand in southern Indochina \\tby 3,800 B.P . \\nHowever , Sidwell ( 2015c ) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic , since each Austroasiatic branch has different \\tterms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai , Chinese , Tibetan , Malay , and other languages . \\nDuring the Iron Age about 2,500 B.P. , relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as Vietic , Katuic , Pearic \\t, and Khmer were formed , while the more internally diverse Bahnaric branch ( dating to about 3,000 B.P . ) \\nunderwent more extensive \\tinternal diversification . \\nBy the Iron Age , all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their \\tpresent-day locations , with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age . \\nPaul Sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the Austroasiatic language \\tfamily to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P . \\nduring the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina , but notes \\tthat the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date . \\nThe lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided \\tinto an early and late stratum . \\nThe early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts , animal names , natural features , and pronouns , while the names of \\tcultural items ( agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts , which are reconstructible in Proto-Austroasiatic ) form part of the later stratum . \\nRoger Blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies ( such as boats \\t, waterways , river fauna , and fish capture techniques ) can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic . \\nBlench ( 2017 ) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river , \\tvalley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . \\n' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( Central Austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' \\t, 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , fishing bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . \\nArchaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern Indochina ( northern Vietnam , Laos , and other nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years ago \\t( 2,000 BC ) , with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P . \\nSidwell ( 2022 ) proposes that the locus of Proto-Austroasiatic was in the Red River Delta area \\tabout 4,000-4,500 years before present , instead of the Middle Mekong as he had previously proposed . \\nAustroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and \\talso upstream through river valleys . \\nKhmuic , Palaungic , and Khasic resulted from a westward \\tdispersal that ultimately came from the Red Valley valley . \\nBased on their current distributions , about half of all Austroasiatic branches ( \\tincluding Nicobaric and Munda ) can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals . \\nHence , this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic \\tas compared to Sino-Tibetan , whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture . \\nIn addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle , early Austroasiatic speakers would have \\talso had access to livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . \\nAs early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered speakers of \\tolder language families who were already settled in the area , such as Sino-Tibetan . \\nSidwell ( \\t2018 ) . \\nSidwell ( 2018 ) ( quoted in Sidwell 2021 ) gives a more nested classification of \\tAustroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of Austroasiatic languages using a 200-word list . \\nMany of the tentative \\tgroupings are likely linkages . \\nPakanic and Shompen \\twere not included . \\nPossible extinct \\tbranches . \\nRoger Blench ( 2009 ) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches \\tof Austroasiatic that are now extinct , based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages . \\nOther languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are : John Peterson ( 2017 ) suggests that `` pre-Munda '' ( `` proto- '' in regular terminology ) \\tlanguages may have once dominated the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain , and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east . \\nPeterson notes that eastern Indo-Aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to \\tthose of Munda languages , while western Indo-Aryan languages do not . \\nWriting \\tsystems . \\nOther than Latin-based alphabets , many Austroasiatic languages are written with \\tthe Khmer , Thai , Lao , and Burmese alphabets . \\nVietnamese divergently had an indigenous script \\tbased on Chinese logographic writing . \\nThis has since been supplanted by the \\tLatin alphabet in the 20th century . \\nThe following are examples of past-used alphabets \\tor current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages . \\nExternal \\trelations . \\nAustric \\tlanguages . \\nAustroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial Austric hypothesis , which also includes the \\tAustronesian languages , and in some proposals also the Kra–Dai languages and the Hmong–Mien languages . \\nHmong-Mien \\t. \\nSeveral lexical resemblances are found between the Hmong-Mien and Austroasiatic language families ( Ratliff 2010 \\t) , some of which had earlier been proposed by Haudricourt ( 1951 ) . \\nThis could imply a relation or \\tearly language contact along the Yangtze . \\nAccording to Cai \\t( et al . \\n2011 ) , Hmong–Mien is at least partially related to Austroasiatic \\tbut was heavily influenced by Sino-Tibetan , especially Tibeto-Burman languages . \\nIndo-Aryan \\tlanguages . \\nIt is suggested that the Austroasiatic languages have some influence \\ton Indo-Aryan languages including Sanskrit and middle Indo-Aryan languages . \\nIndian linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in \\tlanguages such as Hindi , Punjabi and Bengali were borrowed from Munda languages . \\nAdditionally , French linguist Jean Przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the Austroasiatic realm \\tand the Indian mythological stories of Matsyagandha ( from `` Mahabharata '' ) and the Nāgas . \\nAustroasiatic migrations \\tand archaeogenetics . \\nsuggests that Haplogroup O1b1 , which is common in Austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern China , and haplogroup \\tO1b2 , which is common in today 's Japanese , Koreans and , are the carriers of early rice-agriculturalists from Indochina . \\nAnother study suggests that the haplogroup O1b1 is the major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and \\tO1b2 the `` para-Austroasiatic '' lineage of the , Korean and Yayoi people . \\nA 2021 study by \\tTagore et al . \\nfound that the proto-Austroasiatic speakers split from an Basal East Asian source population , native to Mainland Southeast Asia and Northeast \\tIndia , which also gave rise to other East Asian-related populations , including Northeast Asians and Indigenous peoples of the Americas . \\nThe proto-Austroasiatic speakers can be linked \\tto the Hoabinhian material culture . \\nFrom Mainland Southeast Asia , the Austroasiatic speakers \\texpanded into the Indian-subcontinent and Maritime Southeast Asia . \\nThere is evidence that later back migration from more northerly East Asian groups ( such as Kra-Dai \\tspeakers ) merged with indigenous Southeast Asians , contributing to the fragmentation observed among modern day Austroasiatic-speakers . \\nIn the Indian subcontinent , Austroasiatic speakers , \\tspecifically Mundari , intermixed with the local population . \\nFurthermore they concluded that their results do not support a genetic relationship between Ancient Southeast Asian \\thunter-gatherers ( Hoabinhians ) with Papuan-related groups , as previously suggested by McColl et al . \\n2018 , but that these Ancient Southeast Asians \\tare characterized by Basal East Asian ancestry . \\nThe authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with \\tlinguistic identity , pointing to the fragmentation of modern Austroasiatic speakers . \\nLarena et \\tal . \\n2021 could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of Basal East Asians in Mainland Southeast Asia , which \\tare estimated to have formed about 50kya years ago , and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards . \\nEarly Austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage , which split from Ancestral East Asians between 25,000 \\tand 15,000 years ago , and were among the first wave to replace distinct Australasian-related groups in Insular Southeast Asia . \\nEast Asian-related ancestry became dominant in Insular Southeast Asia already between 15,000 years to 12,000 years ago , and may be \\tassociated with Austroasiatic groups , which however got again replaced by later Austronesian groups some 10,000 to 7,000 years ago . \\nEarly Austroasiatic people were found to be best represented \\tby the Mlabri people in modern day Thailand . \\nProposals for Austroasiatic substratum among later Austronesian languages in Western Indonesia , noteworthy among the Dayak \\tlanguages , is strengthened by genetic data , suggesting Austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by Austronesian speakers . \\nA study in November 2021 \\t( Guo et al . ) \\nfound that modern East-Eurasians can be modeled from four ancestry components , which descended from a common ancestor in Mainland Southeast Asia , one being the `` Ancestral \\tAustroasiatic '' component ( AAA ) , which is more prevalent among modern Southeast Asians , and making up the exclusive ancestry among Austroasiatic-speaking Lua and Mlabri people . \\nThe early Austroasiatic speakers are suggested to have been hunter-gatherers but became rice-agriculturalists quite early , spreading from Mainland Southeast \\tAsia northwards to the Yangtze river , westwards into the Indian subcontinent , and southwards into Insular Southeast Asia . \\nEvidence for these migrations are Austroasiatic loanwords related to rice-agriculture found \\tamong non-Austroasiatic languages , and the presence of Austroasiatic genetic ancestry . \\nAccording to a recent genetic study , Sundanese , Javanese , and Balinese , \\thas almost an equal ratio of genetic marker shared between Austronesian and Austroasiatic heritages . \\nMigration into \\tIndia . \\nAccording to Chaubey et al. , `` Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from \\tdispersal from Southeast Asia ,

and within the Semitic family , Akkadian , Hebrew , Phoenician , other Canaanite languages , Amorite , Ugaritic and Aramaic . \\nWhile there is no consensus among historical linguists concerning the original homeland of \\tthe Afroasiatic family or the period when the parent language ( i.e . \\nProto-Afroasiatic ) was spoken , most agree that it \\twas located within a region of Northeast Africa . \\nProposed specific locations include the Horn of Africa , \\tEgypt , the eastern Sahara , and the Levant . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nIn the early 19th century , linguists grouped the Berber , Cushitic and Egyptian languages within a `` Hamitic '' \\tphylum , in acknowledgement of these languages ' genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic phylum . \\nThe terms `` Hamitic '' and `` Semitic '' were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis \\t, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham and Shem , two sons of Noah . \\nBy the 1860s , the main constituent elements within \\tthe broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out . \\nFriedrich Müller introduced the name `` Hamito-Semitic '' for the entire language \\tfamily in his `` Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft '' ( 1876 ) . \\nMaurice Delafosse ( 1914 ) later coined the term `` \\tAfroasiatic '' ( often now spelled `` Afro-Asiatic '' ) . \\nHowever , it did not come into general use until \\tJoseph Greenberg ( 1950 ) formally proposed its adoption . \\nIn doing so , Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that 'Hamitic ' \\twas not a valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race . \\nIn current scholarly usage , the most commonly used names are `` \\tAfroasiatic '' , `` Hamito-Semitic '' , and `` Semito-Hamitic '' . \\nIndividual scholars have also called the family `` Erythraean '' ( \\tTucker 1966 ) and `` Lisramic '' ( Hodge 1972 ) . \\nIn lieu of `` Hamito-Semitic '' , the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term `` Afrasian '' , meaning \\t`` half African , half Asiatic '' , in reference to the geographic distribution of the family 's constituent languages . \\nDistribution and \\tbranches . \\nScholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including at least the following five branches : A sixth family 's inclusion in Afroasiatic is disputed by a minority \\tof scholars : Although there is general agreement on these six families , linguists who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement , in particular : Demographics . \\nIn descending order of the number of speakers \\t, widely-spoken Afroasiatic languages include : Classification history . \\nIn the 9th century the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria became the first \\tto link two branches of Afroasiatic together ; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic . \\nHe knew of Semitic through his study \\tof Arabic , Hebrew , and Aramaic . \\nIn the course of the 19th century \\t, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships . \\nIn 1844 , Theodor Benfey proposed a language family consisting of Semitic , \\tBerber , and Cushitic ( he called the latter `` Ethiopic '' ) . \\nIn the same \\tyear T.N . \\nNewman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa , but \\tthis would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty . \\nFriedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his `` Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` Outline of Linguistics '' ) , and defined \\tit as consisting of a Semitic group plus a `` Hamitic '' group containing Egyptian , Berber , and Cushitic ; he excluded the Chadic group . \\nIt was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) who restricted Hamitic to \\tthe non-Semitic languages in Africa , which are characterized by a grammatical gender system . \\nThis `` Hamitic language group '' was proposed to unite various , mainly North-African , languages , including the Ancient \\tEgyptian language , the Berber languages , the Cushitic languages , the Beja language , and the Chadic languages . \\nUnlike Müller , Lepsius saw Hausa and \\tNama as part of the Hamitic group . \\nThese classifications relied in part on \\tnon-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments . \\nBoth authors used the skin-color , mode of subsistence , and other characteristics \\tof native speakers as part of their arguments for grouping particular languages together . \\nIn 1912 , Carl Meinhof published `` Die Sprachen der Hamiten '' ( `` The Languages of the Hamites '' ) , in which \\the expanded Lepsius 's model , adding the Fula , Maasai , Bari , Nandi , Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group . \\nMeinhof 's model was widely \\tsupported in the 1940s . \\nMeinhof 's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that `` speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous \\twith cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa ' . '' \\nHowever , in the case of the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages ( a concept he introduced ) , it \\twas based on the typological feature of gender and a `` fallacious theory of language mixture '' . \\nMeinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would \\tlater dub `` Nilo-Hamitic '' were in fact Nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages . \\nLeo Reinisch ( 1909 ) had already proposed linking Cushitic and \\tChadic while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic . \\nHowever , his suggestion \\tfound little acceptance . \\nMarcel Cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of a distinct `` Hamitic '' \\tsubgroup and included Hausa ( a Chadic language ) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary . \\nFinally , Joseph Greenberg 's 1950 work led to the widespread \\trejection of `` Hamitic '' as a language category by linguists . \\nGreenberg refuted Meinhof 's linguistic theories and rejected \\tthe use of racial and social evidence . \\nIn dismissing the notion of a separate `` Nilo-Hamitic '' language category , in particular \\t, Greenberg was `` returning to a view widely held a half-century earlier '' . \\nHe consequently rejoined Meinhof 's so-called Nilo-Hamitic \\tlanguages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings . \\nHe also added ( and sub-classified ) the Chadic languages , and \\tproposed a new name , `` Afroasiatic '' , for the family . \\nAlmost all scholars have accepted this classification \\tas the new and continued consensus . \\nGreenberg developed his model fully in his book `` The Languages of Africa '' ( 1963 ) , \\tin which he reassigned most of Meinhof 's additions to Hamitic to other language families , notably Nilo-Saharan . \\nFollowing Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof , he classified the Khoekhoe language as a member of the Khoisan \\tlanguages , a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds . \\nTo Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe , though this view \\thas been discredited as linguists working on these languages regard them as linguistic isolates . \\nDespite this , Greenberg 's classification remains a starting point for modern work on many languages spoken in \\tAfrica , and the Hamitic category ( and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic ) has no part in this . \\nSince the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages ( Berber , Cushitic and Egyptian ) have not been shown to form an exclusive \\t( monophyletic ) phylogenetic unit of their own , separate from other Afroasiatic languages , linguists no longer use the term in this sense . \\nEach of these branches is instead now regarded as \\tan independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family . \\nIn 1969 , Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is \\tan independent branch of Afroasiatic , suggesting for it the new name `` Omotic '' . \\nThis proposal and name have \\tmet with widespread acceptance . \\nBased on typological differences with the other Cushitic languages , Robert Hetzron proposed that Beja \\thas to be removed from Cushitic , thus forming an independent branch of Afroasiatic . \\nMost scholars , however , reject this proposal , and continue to \\tgroup Beja as the sole member of a Northern branch within Cushitic . \\n`` Glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of \\tOmotic has been established , nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge . \\nIt therefore splits off the following groups as small families : South Omotic , Mao , \\tDizoid , Gonga–Gimojan ( North Omotic apart from the preceding ) , Ongota , and Kujarge . \\nSubgrouping \\t. \\nLittle agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic \\t: Semitic , Egyptian , Berber , Chadic , Cushitic , and Omotic . \\nHowever , Christopher Ehret ( 1979 ) , Harold Fleming ( 1981 ) , and Joseph \\tGreenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first . \\nOtherwise : Date \\tof Afroasiatic . \\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian \\tinscription dated to c. 3400 BC ( 5,400 years ago ) . \\nSymbols on Gerzean ( Naqada II ) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date \\tback to c. 4000 BC , suggesting an earlier possible dating . \\nThis gives us a minimum date \\tfor the age of Afroasiatic . \\nHowever , Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic , \\tand considerable time must have elapsed in between them . \\nEstimates of the date at which the \\tProto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely . \\nThey fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC ( 9,500 years \\tago ) , and approximately 16,000 BC ( 18,000 years ago ) . \\nAccording to Igor M. Diakonoff ( 1988 : 33n \\t) , Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC . \\nChristopher Ehret ( 2002 : 35–36 ) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 \\tBC at the latest , and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC . \\nThese dates are older than \\tthose associated with other proto-languages . \\nAfroasiatic \\tUrheimat . \\nThe Afroasiatic `` urheimat '' , the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community , \\tor complex of communities , before the original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages , is unknown . \\nAfroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia , North Africa \\t, the Horn of Africa , and parts of the Sahel . \\nTheir distribution seems to have been influenced by the \\tSahara pump operating over the last 10,000 years . \\nThere is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of the language family existed , but some \\tlink the first speakers to the first farmers in the Levant who would later spread to North and East Africa . \\nOthers argue the first speakers were \\tpre-agricultural and based in Northeast Africa . \\nShared features with Indo-European languages in West Asia related to food production are \\tsuggested by some scholars to support a Levantine origin for Afroasiatic languages . \\nThe Levantine hypothesis does not account for the domestication of plants endemic to the Horn of Africa such as teff , ensete , and niger seed \\tor for the lack of evidence for intrusive agricultural populations or the cultivation of wheat , barley , or sorghum there prior to 3000 BC . \\nA Northeast African origin is supported \\tby the majority of scholars today . \\nThe region includes the majority of the diversity of the Afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups \\tin close geographic proximity , which is sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin . \\nIgor M. Diakonoff placed the origin of the Afro-Asiatic languages in northeast Africa , with \\tolder strands south of Egypt , and newer elements straddling the Nile Delta and Sinai . \\nChristopher Ehret argues that Proto-Afroasiatic speakers in Northeast Africa developed subsistence patterns of intensive plant collection and \\tpastoralism , which gave the population an economic advantage that impelled the expansion of the Afroasiatic languages . \\nEhret suggests that a Proto-Semitic- or Proto-Semito-Berber-speaking population migrated from Northeast Africa to the \\tLevant during the late Paleolithic and eventually gave rise to the Natufian culture . \\nThe linguist Roger Blench proposed southwestern Ethiopia as the most likely homeland of Afroasiatic , in \\tpart because of the high internal diversification of the Omotic branch spoken in that region . \\nVarious scholars have hypothesized on the origins \\tof Afroasiatic based on genetic evidence . \\nY Haplogroup E-M215 is common among modern Afroasiatic-speaking groups and has \\tbeen associated with an ancestral Afroasiatic population in Northeast Africa . \\nIn a 2014 autosomal DNA \\tstudy , Hodgson et al . \\npostulate that the Afroasiatic languages may have been spread by an ancestral population ( s ) \\tcarrying a newly-identified non-African genetic component , which the researchers dub the `` Ethio-Somali '' . \\nThe genetic component is prevalent among modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations and is found \\tat its highest levels among those in the Horn of Africa . \\nThe researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population ( s ) probably migrated from the Near East to Northeast Africa in the pre-agricultural period \\t( ~12–23 ka ) and that a descendant population migrated back to the Levant prior to 4000 BC and developed the Semitic branch of Afroasiatic . \\nSimilarities in grammar \\tand syntax . \\nFeatures observed in all known Afroasiatic language families include : Widespread , though not universal , features of the Afroasiatic languages include : One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation \\t( see the table at right ) , with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n j/ , and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /j-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/ . \\nAccording to Ehret ( 1996 ) , tonal languages appear in the Omotic \\tand Chadic branches of Afroasiatic , as well as in certain Cushitic languages . \\nThe Semitic , Berber and Egyptian branches \\tgenerally do not use tones phonemically . \\nThe Berber and Semitic branches share \\tcertain grammatical features ( e.g . \\nalternative feminine endings * -ay/ * -āy ; corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations ) which can be reconstructed for a higher-order proto-language \\t( provisionally called `` Proto-Berbero-Semitic '' by Kossmann & amp ; Suchard ( 2018 ) and Van Putten ( 2018 ) ) . \\nWhether this proto-language is ancestral to Berber and Semitic only , or \\talso to other branches of Afroasiatic , still remains to be established . \\nShared \\tvocabulary . \\nThe following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates , including \\tten pronouns , three nouns , and three verbs . \\nThere are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic , one by Christopher \\tEhret , and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova . \\nThe two dictionaries disagree \\ton almost everything . \\nThe following table contains the thirty roots or so ( out of thousands \\t) that represent a fragile consensus of present research : Etymological bibliography . \\nSome of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include : < /doc > < doc id= '' 600 '' url= '' https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=600 '' title= '' Andorra '' > Andorra Andorra \\t, officially the Principality of Andorra , is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the Iberian Peninsula , in the eastern Pyrenees , bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south . \\nBelieved to have been created by Charlemagne , Andorra was ruled by the count of \\tUrgell until 988 , when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell . \\nThe present principality was formed \\tby a charter in 1278 . \\nIt is headed by two co-princes : the bishop of \\tUrgell in Catalonia , Spain and the president of France . \\nIts capital and largest city \\tis Andorra la Vella . \\nAndorra is the sixth-smallest state in Europe , with \\tan area of and a population of approximately . \\nThe Andorran people are a Romance \\tethnic group of originally Catalan descent . \\nAndorra is the world 's 16th-smallest country \\tby land and 11th-smallest by population . \\nIts capital , Andorra la Vella , is the highest capital \\tcity in Europe , at an elevation of above sea level . \\nThe official language is Catalan , but Spanish , \\tPortuguese , and French are also commonly spoken . \\nTourism in Andorra brings an estimated 10.2 \\tmillion visitors to the country annually . \\nAndorra is not a member \\tstate of the European Union . \\nIt has been a member of \\tthe United Nations since 1993 . \\nEtymology \\t. \\nThe origin of the word Andorra is unknown \\t, although several hypotheses have been proposed . \\nThe oldest is one put forward by the Greek historian Polybius ( `` The Histories '' III , 35 , 1 ) , who describes the Andosins , \\tan Iberian Pre-Roman tribe , as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars . \\nThe word Andosini or Andosins ( ) may derive from the \\tBasque ' , meaning `` big '' or `` giant '' . \\nThe Andorran toponymy shows evidence of \\tBasque language in the area . \\nAnother theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old \\tword Anorra that contains the Basque word ' ( water ) . \\nAnother theory suggests that Andorra may derive from \\t, meaning `` the thickly wooded place '' . \\nWhen the Arabs and Moors conquered the Iberian Peninsula , the valleys \\tof the High Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest . \\nThese regions were not administered by Muslims , \\tbecause of the geographic difficulty of direct rule . \\nOther theories suggest that the term derives from the Navarro-Aragonese `` andurrial '' \\t, which means `` land covered with bushes '' or `` scrubland '' . \\nThe folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite valley of Endor or Andor ( where the Midianites had \\tbeen defeated ) , a name bestowed by his heir and son Louis the Pious after defeating the Moors in the `` wild valleys of Hell '' . \\nHistory \\t. \\nPrehistory \\t. \\nLa Balma de la Margineda , found by archaeologists at Sant Julià de Lòria , was \\tsettled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees . \\nThe seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing \\tby the groups of hunter-gatherers from Ariege and Segre . \\nDuring the Neolithic Age , a group of people moved to the Valley of Madriu ( the present-day \\tNatural Park located in Escaldes-Engordany declared UNESCO World Heritage Site ) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE . \\nThe population of the valley grew cereals , raised domestic livestock , \\tand developed a commercial trade with people from the Segre and Occitania . \\nOther archaeological deposits include the Tombs of Segudet ( Ordino ) and Feixa del Moro ( Sant Julià \\tde Lòria ) , both dated in 4900–4300 BCE as an example of the Urn culture in Andorra . \\nThe model of small settlements began to evolve \\tto a complex urbanism during the Bronze Age . \\nMetallurgical items of iron , ancient coins , and relicaries can \\tbe found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country . \\nThe sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes ( Stone of the Witches ) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age \\tin Andorra , located in the parish of Canillo , about the rituals of funerals , ancient scripture and engraved stone murals . \\nIberian and \\tRoman Andorra . \\nThe inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the Iberians and historically located in Andorra \\tas the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini ( ) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC . \\nInfluenced by the Aquitanian , Basque and Iberian \\tlanguages , the locals developed some current toponyms . \\nEarly writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century \\tBC by the Greek writer Polybius in his `` Histories '' during the Punic Wars . \\nSome of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d'Enclar ( part \\tof the early Marca Hispanica ) , l'Anxiu in Les Escaldes and Roc de L'Oral in Encamp . \\nThe presence of Roman influence is recorded from the \\t2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE . \\nThe places with the most Roman presence are in Camp Vermell ( Red Field ) in Sant Julià \\tde Lòria , and in some places in Encamp , as well as in the Roc d'Enclar . \\nPeople continued trading , mainly with wine and cereals , with the Roman cities of Urgellet ( the present-day La Seu \\td'Urgell ) and all across Segre through the `` via romana '' Strata Ceretana ( also known as Strata Confluetana ) . \\nVisigoths and Carolingians : \\tthe legend of Charlemagne . \\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire , Andorra came under the influence of \\tthe Visigoths , the Kingdom of Toledo , and the Diocese of Urgell . \\nThe Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 \\tyears , during which time Christianity spread . \\nWhen the Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the \\tIberian Peninsula , Andorra was sheltered from these Arab invaders by the Franks . \\nTradition holds that Charles the Great ( Charlemagne ) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of 5,000 \\tsoldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver , in return for fighting against the Moors near Porté-Puymorens ( Cerdanya ) . \\nAndorra remained part of the Frankish `` Marca Hispanica '' , the buffer zone between the Frankish Empire and the Muslim territories \\t, Andorra being part of the territory ruled by the Count of Urgell and eventually the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell . \\nTradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne , Louis the Pious \\t, writing the `` Carta de Poblament '' or a local municipal charter circa 805 . \\nIn 988 , Count Borrell II of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys \\tto the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya . \\nSince then , the bishop of Urgell , based \\tin Seu d'Urgell , has been co-prince of Andorra . \\nThe first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the `` Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral \\tde la Seu d'Urgell '' ( Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell ) . \\nThe document , dated 839 , depicts the six old parishes of \\tthe Andorran valleys that made up the country 's administrative division . \\nMedieval Age : The Paréages and \\tthe founding of the Co-Principality . \\nBefore 1095 , Andorra had no military protection , and the bishop of Urgell , who knew that the \\tcount of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys , asked the Lord of Caboet for help and protection . \\nIn 1095 , the lord of Caboet and the bishop of \\tUrgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra . \\nArnalda , daughter of Arnau of Caboet \\t, married the viscount of Castellbò . \\nTheir daughter , Ermessenda , married the \\tcount of Foix , Roger-Bernard II . \\nRoger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over \\tAndorra with the bishop of Urgell . \\nIn the 13th century , a military dispute arose between the bishop of \\tUrgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the Cathar Crusade . \\nThe conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of Aragon , Peter III , between the bishop and the count , by the signing of the first paréage , which \\tprovided that Andorra 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix ( whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state ) and the bishop of Urgell , in Catalonia . \\nThis gave the principality its \\tterritory and political form . \\nA second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the \\tcount of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d'Enclar . \\nThe document was ratified by the noble notary Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà \\t, and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited . \\nIn 1364 , the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic ( now spokesman and president of the parliament ) \\tas representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes , making possible the creation of local departments ( comuns , quarts and veïnats ) . \\nAfter being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count John I , the Consell de la Terra or Consell General de \\tles Valls ( General Council of the Valleys ) was founded in 1419 , the second oldest parliament in Europe . \\nThe syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the Justice Courts ( La Cort de Justicia ) in 1433 with the \\tco-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc ( literally `` fire and site '' , a national tax active since then ) . \\nAlthough there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ( Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or Església de Santa Coloma ) , Andorra developed exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th through \\t14th centuries , particularly in the construction of churches , bridges , religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child ( Our Lady of Meritxell being the most important ) . \\nNowadays , the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra 's cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way , with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve \\t, Sant Joan de Caselles , Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters , Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others . \\nThe Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the Catalan \\tlanguage at the end of the 11th century . \\nAndorra was influenced by this language , which was adopted locally decades \\tbefore it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon . \\nThe local economy during the Middle Ages was based \\ton livestock , agriculture , furs and weavers . \\nLater , at the end of the 11th century , the first iron foundries began to appear in Northern Parishes like Ordino , much \\tappreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges , an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century . \\n16th to \\t18th centuries . \\nIn 1601 the Tribunal de Corts ( High Court of Justice ) was created as a result of Huguenot rebellions in France \\t, Inquisition courts coming from Spain and witchcraft-related beliefs native to the area , in the context of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation . \\nWith the passage of time , the co-title \\tto Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre . \\nAfter Henry III of Navarre became king of France , he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head \\tof the French state and the bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra , a political arrangement that still holds . \\nDuring 1617 , communal councils form the sometent ( popular militia or army ) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ( brigandage \\t) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition , organization and competences current today . \\nAndorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ( \\tfargues , a system similar to Farga Catalana ) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade . \\nIn 1371 and 1448 , the co-princes ratified the fair of Andorra \\tla Vella , the most important annual national festival commercially ever since . \\nThe country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers \\t, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors , in Escaldes-Engordany . \\nFounded in 1604 , it took \\tadvantage of the local thermal waters . \\nBy this time , the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms ( wealthy society ) and casalers \\t( rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition ) , deriving from the tradition of pubilla and hereu . \\nThree centuries after its foundation , the Consell de la Terra located its \\theadquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in Casa de la Vall in 1702 . \\nThe manor house built in 1580 served as \\ta noble fortress of the Busquets family . \\nInside the parliament was placed the Closet of the six keys ( Armari de les sis claus ) , \\trepresentative of each Andorran parish , where the Andorran constitution and other documents and laws were later kept . \\nIn both the Reapers ' War and the War of the Spanish Succession , the Andorran people ( \\twhile professing to be a neutral country ) supported the Catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716 . \\nThe reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra , with cultural works such as the `` Book of Privileges '' ( `` Llibre de Privilegis de \\t1674 '' ) , `` Manual Digest '' ( 1748 ) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the `` Polità andorrà '' ( 1763 ) by Antoni Puig . \\n19th century : the New \\tReform and the Andorran Question . \\nAfter the French Revolution , Napoleon I reestablished the \\tCo-Principate in 1809 and removed the French medieval title . \\nIn 1812–1813 , the First French Empire annexed Catalonia during the Peninsular War ( ) and divided \\tthe region into four départements , with Andorra as a part of the district of Puigcerdà . \\nIn 1814 , an imperial decree reestablished \\tthe independence and economy of Andorra . \\nDuring this period , Andorra 's late medieval \\tinstitutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged . \\nIn 1866 , the syndic Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit led the reformist group in a \\tCouncil General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families . \\nThe Council General replaced the aristocratic \\toligarchy that previously ruled the state . \\nThe New Reform ( ) began after ratification by both Co-Princes and established \\tthe basis of the constitution and symbolssuch as the tricolour flagof Andorra . \\nA new service economy arose as a demand of the valley inhabitants and began \\tto build infrastructure such as hotels , spa resorts , roads and telegraph lines . \\nThe authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos \\tand betting houses throughout the country . \\nThe ban resulted in an economic conflict and the Revolution of 1881 , which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic \\ton 8 December 1880 , and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas . \\nThe Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction \\tof casinos and spas by foreign companies . \\nFrom 7 to 9 June 1881 , the loyalists of Canillo and Encamp reconquered the \\tparishes of Ordino and La Massana by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in Escaldes-Engordany . \\nAfter a day of combat the Treaty of the \\tBridge of Escalls was signed on 10 June . \\nThe council was replaced and \\tnew elections were held . \\nThe economic situation worsened , as the populace was divided over the \\t– the `` Andorran Question '' in relation to the Eastern Question . \\nThe struggles continued between pro-bishops , pro-French , and nationalists \\tbased on the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885 . \\nAndorra participated in the cultural \\tmovement of the Catalan Renaixença . \\nBetween 1882 and 1887 , the first academic schools were \\tformed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language , Catalan . \\nRomantic authors from France and Spain reported the \\tawakening of the national consciousness of the country . \\nJacint Verdaguer lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared \\tworks related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer , Joaquim de Riba . \\nIn 1848 , Fromental Halévy had premiered the opera `` Le Val d'Andorre '' to great success in Europe \\t, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War . \\n20th and 21st century : Modernisation of \\tthe country and the Constitutional Andorra . \\nIn 1933 France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the Revolution of 1933 and the FHASA strikes ( Vagues de FHASA ) ; the revolt led by Joves Andorrans ( a labour union group related to \\tthe Spanish CNT and FAI ) called for political reforms , the universal suffrage vote of all Andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA 's hydroelectric power station in Encamp . \\nOn 5 April 1933 Joves \\tAndorrans seized the Andorran Parliament . \\nThese actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 gendarmes and \\tthe mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat . \\nOn 6 July 1934 , adventurer and nobleman Boris Skossyreff , with his promise of freedoms and modernization of the country and wealth through the establishment \\tof a tax haven and foreign investments , received the support of the members of the General Council to proclaim himself the sovereign of Andorra . \\nOn 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell , declaring himself Boris I , King of Andorra \\t, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell and approving the King 's constitution on 10 July . \\nHe was arrested by the Co-Prince and Bishop Justí Guitart i Vilardebó \\tand their authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain . \\nFrom 1936 until 1940 , a French military detachment of Garde Mobile led by well-known Colonel René-Jules Baulard was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the \\tprincipality against disruption from the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain and also face the rise of Republicanism in the aftermath of the 1933 Revolution . \\nDuring the Spanish Civil War , the inhabitants of Andorra welcomed refugees from both sides , and many of them settled \\tpermanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the capitalist era of Andorra . \\nFrancoist troops reached the Andorran border in \\tthe later stages of the war . \\nDuring World War II , Andorra remained neutral and was an important \\tsmuggling route between Vichy France and Francoist Spain , two fascist states . \\nMany Andorrans criticized the passivity of the General Council for impeding both the entry and expulsion of \\tforeigners and refugees , committing economic crimes , reducing the rights of citizens and sympathy with Francoism . \\nGeneral Council members justified the council 's political and diplomatic actions as \\tnecessary for Andorra 's survival and the protection of its sovereignty . \\nAndorra was relatively unscathed by the two \\tworld wars and the Spanish Civil War . \\nCertain groups formed to help victims of oppression in Nazi-occupied \\tcountries , while participating in smuggling to help Andorra survive . \\nAmong the most prominent was the Hostal Palanques Evasion Network Command , which , in contact \\twith the British Mi6 , helped almost 400 fugitives , among whom were Allied military personnel . \\nThe Command remained active between 1941 and 1944 , although there \\twere struggles with pro-Axis informers and Gestapo agents in Andorra . \\nIn the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda , culture and cinematic art not favorable to totalitarian regimes , promulgated in such places as \\tthe Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel , as a meeting place for Free French forces and a route for escorting crashed Allied pilots out of Europe . \\nThe network was maintained after the war , when film societies were formed , where movies , music and books censored \\tin Franco 's Spain were imported , becoming an anti-censorship attraction for the Catalan or foreign public even within Andorra . \\nAndorran Group ( Agrupament Andorrà ) , an anti-fascist organization linked to the Occitanie 's \\tFrench Resistance , accused the French representative ( veguer ) of collaboration with Nazism . \\nThe Andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two \\taxes : mass tourism and the country 's tax exemption . \\nThe first steps toward the capitalist boom date from the 1930s , with the construction of FHASA and the creation of professional banking with Banc Agrícol ( \\t1930 ) and Crèdit Andorrà ( 1949 ) , later with Banca Mora ( 1952 ) , Banca Cassany ( 1958 ) and SOBANCA ( 1960 ) . \\nShortly after activities such as skiing and shopping become a tourist attraction , \\twith the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s . \\nAll in all , a \\trenovated hotel industry has developed . \\nIn April 1968 a social health insurance \\tsystem was created ( CASS ) . \\nThe Andorran government necessarily involved planning , projection and forecasts for the future : with the official visit of the French co-prince Charles de Gaulle \\tin 1967 and 1969 , it was given approval for the economic boom and national demands within the framework of human rights and international openness . \\nAndorra lived an era commonly known as `` Andorran dream '' ( in relation to the American dream ) along \\twith the Trente Glorieuses : the mass culture rooted the country experiencing radical changes in the economy and culture . \\nProof of this was Ràdio Andorra , the top musical radio station in Europe in this period , with guests and speakers of great importance \\tpromoting musical hits of chanson française , swing , rhythm & amp ; blues , jazz , rock and roll and American country music . \\nDuring this period Andorra achieved a GDP per capita and a life \\texpectancy higher than the most standard countries of the current economy . \\nGiven its relative isolation , Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history \\t, with few ties to countries other than France , Spain and Portugal . \\nBut in recent times its thriving tourist industry along with developments \\tin transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation . \\nSince 1976 the country has seen the need to reform Andorran institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty , \\thuman rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands . \\nIn 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d'Andorra , under the name of Executive \\tBoard ( Consell Executiu ) , chaired by the first prime minister Òscar Ribas Reig with the co-princes ' approval . \\nIn 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with \\tthe European Economic Community to regularize trade relations . \\nIts political system was modernized in 1993 after the Andorran constitutional referendum , when the constitution was drafted by the co-princes \\tand the General Council and approved on 14 March by 74.2 % of voters , with a 76 % turnout . \\nThe first elections under the new constitution \\twere held later in the year . \\nThe same year , Andorra became a member of \\tthe United Nations and the Council of Europe . \\nAndorra formalized diplomatic relations with the United States in \\t1996 , participating in the 51st UN General Assembly . \\nFirst General Syndic Marc Forné took part on a speech in Catalan in the General Assembly to defend the reform of the organization , \\tand after three days he took part in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to defend Andorra 's linguistic rights and economy . \\nIn 2006 a monetary agreement with the European Union was formalized that allows Andorra to use \\tthe euro in an official way , as well as coin its own euro currency . \\nPolitics \\t. \\nAndorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the Bishop of \\tUrgell and the president of France as co-princes . \\nThis peculiarity makes the president of France , in his capacity as prince of Andorra , an \\telected monarch , although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people . \\nThe politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative \\tdemocracy with a unicameral legislature , and of a pluriform multi-party system . \\nThe prime minister is \\tthe chief executive . \\nThe current Prime Minister is Xavier Espot Zamora \\tof the Democrats for Andorra ( DA ) . \\nExecutive power is exercised \\tby the government . \\nLegislative power is vested in \\tboth government and parliament . \\nThe Parliament of Andorra is \\tknown as the General Council . \\nThe General Council consists of \\tbetween 28 and 42 councillors . \\nThe councillors serve for four-year terms , and elections are held between \\tthe 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council . \\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes , \\tand the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency . \\nFifteen days after the election , \\tthe councillors hold their inauguration . \\nDuring this session , the General Syndic , who is the head of the \\tGeneral Council , and the Subsyndic General , his assistant , are elected . \\nEight days later , the \\tCouncil convenes once more . \\nDuring this session , the prime minister \\tis chosen from among the councillors . \\nCandidates can be proposed by a \\tminimum of one-fifth of the councillors . \\nThe Council then elects the candidate with the \\tabsolute majority of votes to be prime minister . \\nThe Syndic General then notifies the co-princes , who in turn \\tappoint the elected candidate as the prime minister of Andorra . \\nThe General Council is also responsible \\tfor proposing and passing laws . \\nBills may be presented to the council as Private Members ' Bills by three of the \\tlocal Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra . \\nThe council also approves the \\tannual budget of the principality . \\nThe government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval \\tat least two months before the previous budget expires . \\nIf the budget is not approved by the first day of the next \\tyear , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved . \\nOnce any bill is approved , the Syndic General is responsible for presenting \\tit to the co-princes so that they may sign and enact it . \\nIf the prime minister is not satisfied with the council , he \\tmay request that the co-princes dissolve the council and order new elections . \\nIn turn , the councillors have the power \\tto remove the prime minister from office . \\nAfter a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors , the council \\twill vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the prime minister is removed . \\nLaw and \\tcriminal justice . \\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court , the Criminal Law \\tCourt , the High Court of Andorra , and the Constitutional Court . \\nThe High Court of Justice is composed of five judges : one appointed by the prime minister , one \\teach by the co-princes , one by the Syndic General , and one by the judges and magistrates . \\nIt is presided over by the member appointed by the \\tSyndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms . \\nThe magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court \\t, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court . \\nThe High Court also appoints members of \\tthe Office of the Attorney General . \\nThe Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and \\treviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties . \\nIt is composed of four judges , one appointed by \\teach of the co-princes and two by the General Council . \\nThey serve \\teight-year terms . \\nThe Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year \\trotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court . \\nForeign relations , \\tdefence and security . \\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces \\t, although there is a small ceremonial army . \\nResponsibility for defending the nation rests \\tprimarily with France and Spain . \\nHowever , in case of emergencies or natural disasters , the Sometent ( an alarm ) \\tis called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve . \\nThis is why all Andorrans , and especially the head of each house ( usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house ) should , \\tby law , keep a rifle , even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need . \\nAndorra is a full member of the United Nations ( UN ) , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) , and \\thas a special agreement with the European Union ( EU ) , it also has observer status at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . \\nOn 16 October 2020 , Andorra became the 190th member of the \\tInternational Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , during the COVID-19 pandemic . \\nMilitary \\t. \\nAndorra has a small army , which has historically been raised or reconstituted at \\tvarious dates , but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army . \\nThe basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the \\tsummoning of the Sometent ( a civil defense organization of Andorra , made up of the heads of households ) . \\nBeing a landlocked country , \\tAndorra has no navy . \\nBefore World War I , Andorra maintained an armed militia force of about 600 part-time militiamen under the supervision of \\ta Captain ( Capità or Cap de Sometent ) and a Lieutenant ( Desener or Lloctinent del Capità ) . \\nThis body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by \\ttwo officials ( veguers ) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell . \\nIn the modern era , the army has consisted of a \\tvery small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties . \\nUniforms and weaponry were handed down from \\tgeneration to generation within families and communities . \\nThe army 's role in internal security was largely taken over \\tby the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931 . \\nBrief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National \\tGendarmerie , with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard . \\nThe Andorran Police was reformed in the following year \\t, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles . \\nThe force consisted of six Corporals , one for each parish ( although there are currently seven parishes , there were only \\tsix until 1978 ) , plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action , and a commander with the rank of major . \\nIt was the responsibility of the six corporals , each in his own parish , to \\tbe able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish . \\nThe only permanent section of the present-day \\tSometent is a twelve-man ceremonial unit . \\nHowever , all able-bodied men are technically available for military service , \\twith a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm . \\nAn area weapon such as a Shotgun per household is unregulated , \\thowever ranged weapons such as Pistols and Rifles require a license . \\nThe army has not fought for more than 700 years , and its \\tmain responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions . \\nAccording to Marc Forné Molné , Andorra 's military budget is \\tstrictly from voluntary donations , and the availability of full-time volunteers . \\nIn more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of Sometent during the floods of 1982 in the \\tCatalan Pyrenees , where 12 citizens perished in Andorra , to help the population and establish a public order along with the Local Police units . \\nPolice \\tCorps . \\nAndorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force \\t, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants . \\nThe principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing \\t, criminal detection , border control , and traffic policing . \\nThere are also small specialist units including police dogs \\t, mountain rescue , and a bomb disposal team . \\nGIPA \\t. \\nThe `` Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra '' ( GIPA ) is a \\tsmall special forces squad trained in counter-terrorism , and hostage recovery tasks . \\nAlthough it is the closest in style to an active military force , \\tit is part of the Police Corps , and not the army . \\nAs terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country , the GIPA \\tis commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties , and at other times to routine policing . \\nFire \\tbrigade . \\nThe Andorran Fire Brigade , with headquarters at Santa Coloma , operates from \\tfour modern fire stations , and has a staff of around 120 firefighters . \\nThe service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances ( fire tenders , turntable ladders , and specialist \\tfour-wheel drive vehicles ) , four light support vehicles ( cars and vans ) and four ambulances . \\nHistorically , the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra \\tmaintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires . \\nThe first fire pump purchased by \\tthe government was acquired in 1943 . \\nSerious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a \\tpermanent fire service , and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961 . \\nThe fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time : two at the \\tbrigade 's headquarters in Santa Coloma , and one crew at each of the other three fire stations . \\nGeography \\t. \\nParishes \\t. \\nAndorra consists of seven \\tparishes : Physical geography . \\nDue to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range , Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains \\t, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at , and the average elevation of Andorra is . \\nThese are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream \\t, the Gran Valira river , leaves the country for Spain ( at Andorra 's lowest point of ) . \\nAndorra 's land \\tarea is . \\nEnvironment \\t. \\nPhytogeographically , Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province \\tof the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom . \\nAccording to the WWF , the territory of Andorra belongs \\tto the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests . \\nAndorra had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of \\t4.45/10 , ranking it 127th globally out of 172 countries . \\nImportant Bird \\tArea . \\nThe whole country has been recognised as a single Important Bird Area ( IBA ) by BirdLife International , because \\tit is important for forest and mountain birds and supports populations of red-billed choughs , citril finches and rock buntings . \\nClimate \\t. \\nAndorra has alpine , continental and \\toceanic climates , depending on altitude . \\nIts higher elevation means there is , on average , more \\tsnow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer . \\nThe diversity of landmarks , the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the Mediterranean climates \\tmake the country have a great diversity of microclimates that hinder the general dominance of the high mountain climate . \\nThe great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points , together with \\tthe influence of a Mediterranean climate , develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees . \\nWhen in precipitation , a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and \\tsummer , which can last until autumn ( May , June and August are usually the rainiest months ) . \\nIn winter , however , it is less rainy , except in the highlands , subject to the \\tinfluence of fronts from the Atlantic , which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains . \\nThe temperature regime is characterized , broadly , by a temperate summer and a \\tlong and cold winter , in accordance with the mountainous condition of the Principality . \\nEconomy \\t. \\nTourism , the mainstay of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do \\teconomy , accounts for roughly 80 % of GDP . \\nAn estimated 10.2 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra \\t's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts . \\nOne of the main sources of income in Andorra is \\ttourism from ski resorts which total over of ski ground . \\nThe sport brings in over 7 million visitors annually and an estimated 340 million euros \\tper year , sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present since 2007 . \\nThe banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy with revenues raised \\texclusively through import tariffs ( the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19 % of GDP ) . \\nHowever , during the European sovereign-debt crisis of the 21st century , the tourist industry suffered a decline , \\tpartly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain , undercutting duty-free shopping and increasing unemployment . \\nOn 1 January 2012 , a business tax of 10 % was introduced , followed by a sales tax \\tof 2 % a year later , which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter . \\nAgricultural production is limited ; only 1.7 % of the land \\tis arable , and most food has to be imported . \\nSome tobacco is \\tgrown locally . \\nThe principal livestock activity \\tis domestic sheep raising . \\nManufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes \\t, cigars , and furniture . \\nAndorra 's natural resources include hydroelectric power , mineral \\twater , timber , iron ore , and lead . \\nAndorra is not a member of the European Union , but enjoys a special relationship with it , such as being treated \\tas an EU member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products . \\nAndorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions \\tuntil 31 December 1999 , when both currencies were replaced by the EU 's single currency , the euro . \\nCoins and notes of both the franc and the peseta \\tremained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002 . \\nAndorra negotiated to issue its own \\teuro coins , beginning in 2014 . \\nAndorra has historically had one of \\tthe world 's lowest unemployment rates . \\nIn 2019 it stood \\tat 2 % . \\nOn 31 May 2013 , it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by \\tthe end of June , against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members . \\nThe announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Prime Minister \\tAntoni Martí and the French President and Prince of Andorra François Hollande . \\nHollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra \\t`` bringing its taxation in line with international standards '' . \\nBy the mid-2010s , the financial system comprised five banking groups , one specialised credit entity , eight investment undertaking management entities , three \\tasset management companies , and 29 insurance companies , 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality . \\nDemographics \\t. \\nPopulation \\t. \\nThe population of Andorra is \\testimated at ( ) . \\nThe Andorrans are a Romance ethnic \\tgroup of originally Catalan descent . \\nThe population has grown \\tfrom 5,000 in 1900 . \\nTwo-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not \\thave the right to vote in communal elections . \\nMoreover , they are not allowed to be elected as prime minister or to \\town more than 33 % of the capital stock of a privately held company . \\nLanguages \\t. \\nThe historic and official language is \\tCatalan , a Romance language . \\nThe Andorran government encourages \\tthe use of Catalan . \\nIt funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra ( Catalan \\t: ) , and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants . \\nAndorran television and radio \\tstations use Catalan . \\nBecause of immigration , historical links , and close geographic \\tproximity , Spanish , Portuguese and French are commonly spoken . \\nMost Andorran residents can speak one or more \\tof these , in addition to Catalan . \\nEnglish is less commonly spoken among the general population , though \\tit is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts . \\nAndorra is one of only four European countries ( together with France , Monaco , and \\tTurkey ) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities . \\nAccording to mother tongue percentage statistics by the Andorran Government \\treleased in 2018 the principality has the following : Religion . \\nThe population of Andorra is predominantly \\t( 88.2 % ) Catholic . \\nTheir patron saint is \\tOur Lady of Meritxell . \\nThere are also members \\tof various Protestant denominations . \\nThere are also small numbers of Muslims , Hindus \\t, and Bahá'ís , and roughly 100 Jews . \\n( See History of the \\tJews in Andorra . ) \\nEducation \\t. \\nSchools \\t. \\nChildren between the ages of 6 and 16 \\tare required by law to have full-time education . \\nEducation up to secondary level is provided \\tfree of charge by the government . \\nThere are three systems of school , Andorran , French and Spanish , which use \\tCatalan , French and Spanish languages respectively , as the main language of instruction . \\nParents may choose which \\tsystem their children attend . \\nAll schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities , but teachers in the \\tFrench and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain . \\n39 % of Andorran children attend Andorran schools , 33 \\t% attend French schools , and 28 % Spanish schools . \\nUniversity of \\tAndorra . \\nThe Universitat d'Andorra ( UdA ) is the state \\tpublic university and is the only university in Andorra . \\nIt was established \\tin 1997 . \\nThe university provides first-level degrees in nursing , computer science , business administration \\t, and educational sciences , in addition to higher professional education courses . \\nThe only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and \\tthe School of Computer Science , the latter having a PhD programme . \\nVirtual Studies \\tCentre . \\nThe geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a \\tfull academic programme , and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies , connected to Spanish and French universities . \\nThe Virtual Studies Centre ( Centre d'Estudis Virtuals ) at the university runs approximately 20 different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields \\tincluding tourism , law , Catalan philology , humanities , psychology , political sciences , audiovisual communication , telecommunications engineering , and East Asia studies . \\nThe centre also runs various postgraduate \\tprogrammes and continuing-education courses for professionals . \\nTransport \\t. \\nUntil the 20th century , Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside \\tworld , and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation . \\nEven now , the nearest major airports at Toulouse and \\tBarcelona are both three hours ' drive from Andorra . \\nAndorra has a road network of \\t, of which is unpaved . \\nThe two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border near Sant Julià de \\tLòria , and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near El Pas de la Casa . \\nBus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities , with services \\ton most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times . \\nThere are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and \\tToulouse , plus a daily tour from the former city . \\nBus services mostly are run by private companies , \\tbut some local ones are operated by the government . \\nThere are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra 's borders but there are , however , heliports in La Massana ( Camí Heliport ) , \\tArinsal and Escaldes-Engordany with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of Alt Urgell , south of the Andorran-Spanish border . \\nSince July 2015 , Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport has operated commercial flights to Madrid and \\tPalma de Mallorca , and is the main hub for Air Andorra and Andorra Airlines . \\nAs of 11 July 2018 , there are \\tno regular commercial flights at the airport . \\nNearby airports located in Spain and France provide \\taccess to international flights for the principality . \\nThe nearest airports are at Perpignan , France ( from \\tAndorra ) and Lleida , Spain ( from Andorra ) . \\nThe largest nearby airports are at Toulouse , France ( from \\tAndorra ) and Barcelona , Spain ( from Andorra ) . \\nThere are hourly bus services from both \\tBarcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra . \\nThe nearest railway station is Andorre-L'Hospitalet station east of Andorra which is on the -gauge line from Latour-de-Carol \\t( ) southeast of Andorra , to Toulouse and on to Paris by the French high-speed trains . \\nThis line is operated \\tby the SNCF . \\nLatour-de-Carol has a scenic trainline to Villefranche-de-Conflent , as well as the SNCF 's \\tgauge line connecting to Perpignan , and the RENFE 's -gauge line to Barcelona . \\nThere are also direct Intercités de Nuit trains \\tbetween L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre and Paris on certain dates . \\nMedia and \\ttelecommunications . \\nIn Andorra , mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the \\tAndorran national telecommunications company , SOM , also known as Andorra Telecom ( STA ) . \\nThe same company also manages the technical infrastructure \\tfor national broadcasting of digital television and radio . \\nIn 2010 Andorra became the first country to provide a direct \\toptical fiber link to all homes ( FTTH ) and businesses . \\nThe first commercial radio station to broadcast was Radio \\tAndorra , which was active from 1939 to 1981 . \\nOn 12 October 1989 , the General Council established radio and television as essential public services creating and managing the \\tentity ORTA , becoming on 13 April 2000 , in the public company Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra ( RTVA ) . \\nIn 1990 , the public radio was \\tfounded on the Radio Nacional d'Andorra . \\nAs an autochthonous television channel , there is only the \\tnational public television network Andorra Televisió , created in 1995 . \\nAdditional TV and radio stations from Spain and France \\tare available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV . \\nThere are three national newspapers , `` Diari d'Andorra '' , `` El Periòdic \\td'Andorra '' , and `` Bondia '' as well as several local newspapers . \\nThe history of the Andorran press begins in the period between 1917 and 1937 with the appearance of several periodicals papers such as `` \\tLes Valls d'Andorra '' ( 1917 ) , `` Nova Andorra '' ( 1932 ) and `` Andorra Agrícola '' ( 1933 ) . \\nIn 1974 , the `` Poble Andorrà '' \\tbecame the first regular newspaper in Andorra . \\nThere is also an amateur radio society \\tand news agency ANA with independent management . \\nCulture \\t. \\nAndorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and \\tmarratxa , which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially . \\nAndorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours , but is especially \\tCatalan in character , especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana . \\nOther Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la \\tVella and Saint Anne 's dance in Escaldes-Engordany . \\nAndorra 's national holiday is Our Lady \\tof Meritxell Day , 8 September . \\nAmong the more important festivals and traditions are the Canólich Gathering in May , the Roser d'Ordino in July , the Meritxell Day ( National Day of Andorra ) , the Andorra la Vella Fair , the \\tSant Jordi Day , the Santa Llúcia Fair , the Festivity from La Candelera to Canillo , the Carnival

Arithmetic mean \\tIn mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean ( ) , arithmetic average , or just the `` mean '' or `` average '' ( when the context is clear ) , is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection . \\nThe collection is often a set of results from an \\texperiment , an observational study , or a survey . \\nThe term `` arithmetic mean '' is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because \\tit helps distinguish it from other types of means , such as geometric and harmonic . \\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean is frequently used in \\teconomics , anthropology , history , and almost every academic field to some extent . \\nFor example , per capita income is the \\tarithmetic average income of a nation 's population . \\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies , it is not a robust statistic \\t: it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values much larger or smaller than most others ) . \\nFor skewed distributions , such as the distribution of income for which a few people 's incomes are substantially higher \\tthan most people 's , the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one 's notion of `` middle '' . \\nIn that case , robust statistics , such as the \\tmedian , may provide a better description of central tendency . \\nDefinition \\t. \\nGiven a data set formula_1 , the `` arithmetic mean '' ( also `` mean '' or `` average '' \\t) , denoted formula_2 ( read formula_3 `` bar '' ) , is the mean of the formula_4 values formula_5 . \\nThe arithmetic mean is a data set 's most \\tcommonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency . \\nIn statistics , the term average refers \\tto any measurement of central tendency . \\nThe arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is equal to the sum of \\tthe numerical values of each observation , divided by the total number of observations . \\nSymbolically , for a data set consisting of the values formula_6 , the arithmetic mean formula_7 is defined by the formula : For example , if the monthly salaries of formula_9 employees are formula_10 , then the arithmetic mean is : If the \\tdata set is a statistical population ( i.e. , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them ) , then the mean of that population is called the `` population mean '' and denoted by the Greek letter formula_12 . \\nIf the data set is a statistical sample ( a subset of the population ) , it is \\tcalled the `` sample mean '' ( which for a data set formula_13 is denoted as formula_14 ) . \\nThe arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimensions , \\tnot only scalar values ; this is often referred to as a centroid . \\nMore generally , because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination ( meaning its coefficients sum to \\tformula_15 ) , it can be defined on a convex space , not only a vector space . \\nMotivating \\tproperties . \\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it \\tinteresting , especially as a measure of central tendency . \\nThese include : \\tContrast with median . \\nThe arithmetic mean may be \\tcontrasted with the median . \\nThe median is defined such that no more than half the values \\tare larger , and no more than half are smaller than it . \\nIf elements in the data increase arithmetically when placed in some \\torder , then the median and arithmetic average are equal . \\nFor example , consider \\tthe data sample formula_23 . \\nThe mean is formula_24 , \\tas is the median . \\nHowever , when we consider a sample that can not be arranged to increase \\tarithmetically , such as formula_25 , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly . \\nIn this case , the arithmetic average is \\tformula_26 , while the median is formula_27 . \\nThe average value can vary considerably from most values in \\tthe sample and can be larger or smaller than most . \\nThere are applications of this \\tphenomenon in many fields . \\nFor example , since the 1980s , the median income in the \\tUnited States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income . \\nGeneralizations \\t. \\nWeighted \\taverage . \\nA weighted average , or weighted mean , is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation. & lt ; ref & gt ; < /doc > < doc id= '' 615 '' url= '' \\thttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki ? curid=615 '' title= '' American Football Conference '' > American Football Conference The American Football Conference ( AFC ) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the highest professional level of American football in the United States . \\nThe AFC and its counterpart , the National Football Conference ( \\tNFC ) , each contain 16 teams with 4 divisions . \\nBoth conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the \\tNational Football League , and the American Football League ( AFL ) . \\nAll ten of the AFL teams , and three NFL teams , became members \\tof the new AFC , with the remaining thirteen NFL teams forming the NFC . \\nA series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger \\t, thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference . \\nThe current AFC champions are the Cincinnati Bengals , who defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in \\tthe 2022 AFC Championship Game for their third conference championship , and their first since 1988 . \\nTeams \\t. \\nLike the NFC , the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions \\teach with four teams : East , North , South and West . \\nSeason \\tstructure . \\nThis chart of the 2021 season standings displays \\tan application of the NFL scheduling formula . \\nThe Bengals in 2021 ( highlighted in green ) \\tfinished in first place in the AFC North . \\nThus , in 2021 , the Bengals are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the AFC East and NFC \\tSouth ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first-place finishers in the AFC South , AFC West ( highlighted in orange ) , and NFC East ( highlighted in pink ) . \\nCurrently , the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula : Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice ( home and away ) during the regular season , in addition to \\televen other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL : three games are assigned on the basis of a particular team 's final divisional standing from the previous season , and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions . \\nThis assignment shifts each year and \\twill follow a standard cycle . \\nUsing the 2021 regular season schedule as an example , each team in the \\tAFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC East . \\nIn this way , non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the \\texception being the three games assigned based on the team 's prior-season divisional standing . \\nAt the end of each season , the four division winners and three wild cards ( \\tnon-division winners with best regular season record ) in the AFC qualify for the playoffs . \\nThe AFC playoffs culminate in the AFC Championship Game \\t, with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy . \\nThe AFC champion then plays the \\tNFC champion in the Super Bowl . \\nHistory \\t. \\nBoth the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL \\tmerged with the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 . \\nThe AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams , and added two more expansion clubs \\t( the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968 ) before the merger . \\nIn order to equalize the number of teams in each conference , three NFL teams that predated the AFL 's launch ( \\tthe Cleveland Browns , Pittsburgh Steelers , and the then-Baltimore Colts ) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC . \\nThe two AFL divisions AFL East and AFL West were more or less intact , while the NFL 's Century Division , in \\twhich the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967 , was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central . \\nUpon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970 , the newly minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines \\tfor the 1970 season ; the National Football Conference , however , could not agree upon their setup , and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16 , 1970 . \\nSince the merger , five expansion teams have joined the AFC \\tand two have left , thus making the current total 16 . \\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in \\t1976 , they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively . \\nThis arrangement lasted for one season only \\tbefore the two teams switched conferences . \\nThe Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC \\tas a result of the 2002 realignment . \\nThe expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined \\tthe AFC in 1995 . \\nThere have been five teams that \\thave relocated at least once . \\nIn 1984 , the Baltimore \\tColts relocated to Indianapolis . \\nIn 1995 , the Cleveland Browns had attempted to move to Baltimore ; the resulting dispute between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the \\tBaltimore Ravens with the players and personnel from the Browns , while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL . \\nThe Ravens were treated \\tas an expansion team . \\nIn California , the Oakland Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982 , back to Oakland in 1995 , and then to \\tLas Vegas in 2020 , while the San Diego Chargers returned to Los Angeles in 2017 after 56 years in San Diego . \\nThe Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee in 1997 \\t, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers . \\nThe team would change its name again , \\ttwo years later , to the Tennessee Titans . \\nThe NFL would again expand in 2002 , \\tadding the Houston Texans to the AFC . \\nWith the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time \\t, the divisional setup has remained static ever since . \\nBetween 1995 and 2021 , the AFC has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the Super Bowl : New England Patriots ( 10 times ) , Pittsburgh Steelers ( 4 times ) , Denver Broncos ( 4 times ) , Baltimore \\tRavens ( 2 times ) , Indianapolis Colts ( 2 times ) , Kansas City Chiefs ( 2 times ) , Cincinnati Bengals ( 1 time ) , Las Vegas Raiders ( 1 time ) , Tennessee Titans ( 1 time ) . \\nBy contrast , the NFC has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only \\tthe Detroit Lions , Minnesota Vikings , and Washington Commanders missing out on an appearance in the Super Bowl . \\n17 of the 19 AFC champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three \\tquarterbacks - Tom Brady , Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger - in the Super Bowl . \\nThe AFC has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 \\tSuper Bowls , while the NFC has started 16 . \\nLogo \\t. \\nThe merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the \\told AFL logo , specifically the `` A '' and the six stars surrounding it . \\nThe AFC logo basically remained \\tunchanged from 1970 to 2009 . \\nThe 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo , with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars ( leaving \\tfour representing the four divisions of the AFC ) , and moving the stars inside the letter , similar to the NFC logo . \\nTelevision \\t. \\nNBC aired the AFC 's Sunday afternoon and \\tplayoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season . \\nFrom 1998 to 2013 , CBS was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC ; in those years , \\tall interconference games in which the AFC team was the visiting team were broadcast on either NBC or CBS . \\nSince 2014 , the cross-flex policy allows select AFC games ( that involve them playing an \\tNFC team at home or intraconference games ) to be moved from CBS to Fox . \\nSince 1990 , select AFC playoff games \\thave been seen on ABC or ESPN . \\nSee \\talso .

Farm Animal Farm is a beast fable , in the form of satirical allegorical novella , by George Orwell , first published in England on 17 August 1945 . \\nIt tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , \\thoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . \\nUltimately , the rebellion is betrayed , and under the dictatorship of a pig named \\tNapoleon , the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before . \\nAccording to Orwell , `` Animal Farm '' reflects events leading up to the Russian \\tRevolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union . \\nOrwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism , an attitude that was \\tcritically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona May Days conflicts between the POUM and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War . \\nIn a letter to Yvonne Davet , Orwell described `` Animal Farm '' as a satirical tale against Stalin ( `` '' ) , and in his essay `` Why I Write '' ( 1946 ) , \\twrote that `` Animal Farm '' was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , `` to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole '' . \\nThe original title was `` Animal Farm : A Fairy Story '' , but US publishers dropped the subtitle when it was \\tpublished in 1946 , and only one of the translations during Orwell 's lifetime , the Telugu version , kept it . \\nOther titular variations include subtitles like `` A \\tSatire '' and `` A Contemporary Satire '' . \\nOrwell suggested the title ' for the French translation , which abbreviates to URSA \\t, the Latin word for `` bear '' , a symbol of Russia . \\nIt also played on the French name \\tof the Soviet Union , ' . \\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944 , when the United Kingdom was in its wartime alliance with \\tthe Soviet Union against Nazi Germany , and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon Orwell hated . \\nThe manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers , \\tincluding one of Orwell 's own , Victor Gollancz , which delayed its publication . \\nIt became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international \\trelations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the Cold War . \\n`` Time '' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; it also featured \\tat number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels , and number 46 on the BBC 's The Big Read poll . \\nIt won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is \\tincluded in the Great Books of the Western World selection . \\nPlot \\tsummary . \\nThe poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon , England , is ripened for rebellion from its \\tanimal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer , Mr. Jones . \\nOne night , the exalted boar , Old Major , holds a conference , at which he calls \\tfor the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called `` Beasts of England '' . \\nWhen Old Major dies , two young pigs , Snowball and Napoleon , assume command and stage \\ta revolt , driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property `` Animal Farm '' . \\nThey adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism , the most important \\tof which is , `` All animals are equal '' . \\nThe decree is painted in large letters \\ton one side of the barn . \\nSnowball teaches the animals to read and write , while \\tNapoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism . \\nTo commemorate the start of Animal Farm , Snowball raises \\ta green flag with a white hoof and horn . \\nFood is plentiful , and \\tthe farm runs smoothly . \\nThe pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set \\taside special food items , ostensibly for their personal health . \\nFollowing an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm ( later dubbed the `` \\tBattle of the Cowshed '' ) , Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill . \\nNapoleon disputes this idea , and matters come to a head , which culminate \\tin Napoleon 's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander . \\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing \\tmeetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm . \\nThrough a young porker named Squealer , Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea \\t, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side . \\nThe animals work harder with the promise \\tof easier lives with the windmill . \\nWhen the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying \\tto sabotage their project , and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by Napoleon of consorting with his old rival . \\nWhen some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed , Napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he \\tis a collaborator of Mr. Jones , even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle . \\n`` Beasts of England '' is replaced with `` Animal Farm '' , while an anthem glorifying Napoleon , who \\tis presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man ( `` Comrade Napoleon '' ) , is composed and sung . \\nNapoleon then conducts a second purge , during which many animals who are alleged to be helping \\tSnowball in plots are executed by Napoleon 's dogs , which troubles the rest of the animals . \\nDespite their hardships , the animals are easily placated by Napoleon 's retort that they are better off than they were under \\tMr. Jones , as well as by the sheep 's continual bleating of `` four legs good , two legs bad '' . \\nMr. Frederick , a neighbouring farmer , attacks the farm \\t, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill . \\nAlthough the animals win the battle , they do so at great \\tcost , as many , including Boxer the workhorse , are wounded . \\nAlthough he recovers from this , Boxer eventually collapses while working on \\tthe windmill ( being almost 12 years old at that point ) . \\nHe is taken away in a knacker 's van and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this , but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by \\tpersuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner 's signboard had not been repainted . \\nSquealer subsequently reports Boxer 's death and honours \\thim with a festival the following day . \\n( However , Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker , \\tallowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves . ) \\nYears pass , the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is \\tconstructed , which makes the farm a good amount of income . \\nHowever , the ideals that Snowball discussed , including stalls with electric lighting , heating , and \\trunning water , are forgotten , with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives . \\nSnowball has been forgotten , alongside Boxer , with `` \\tthe exception of the few who knew him '' . \\nMany of the animals who participated in \\tthe rebellion are dead or old . \\nMr. Jones is also dead we learn , having `` died in \\tan inebriates ' home in another part of the country '' . \\nThe pigs start to resemble humans , as they walk upright \\t, carry whips , drink alcohol , and wear clothes . \\nThe Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase : `` All animals \\tare equal , but some animals are more equal than others '' . \\nThe maxim `` Four legs good , two legs bad '' is \\tsimilarly changed to `` Four legs good , two legs better '' . \\nOther changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner \\tand Old Major 's skull , which was previously put on display , being reburied . \\nNapoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local \\tfarmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance . \\nHe abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and \\trestores the name `` The Manor Farm '' . \\nThe men and pigs start playing cards , flattering \\tand praising each other while cheating at the game . \\nBoth Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington , one of the farmers , play the Ace of \\tSpades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first . \\nWhen the animals outside look at the pigs and men \\t, they can no longer distinguish between the two . \\nGenre and \\tstyle . \\nGeorge Orwell 's `` Animal Farm '' is an example of a political satire and an allegory that was \\tintended to have a `` wider application '' , according to Orwell himself , in terms of its relevance . \\nStylistically , the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell 's other works , most \\tnotably `` Nineteen Eighty-Four '' , as both have been considered works of Swiftian satire . \\nFurthermore , these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell 's bleak view of the future for humanity ; he seems \\tto stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in `` Animal Farm '' and `` Nineteen Eighty-Four '' . \\nIn these kinds of works , Orwell distinctly references the disarray \\tand traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War . \\nOrwell 's style and writing philosophy as a whole were \\tvery concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing . \\nOrwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward , given the \\tway that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse . \\nFor this reason , he is careful , in `` Animal Farm '' \\t, to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion . \\nThe difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact , as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly , \\twhile the wicked animals on the farm , such as Napoleon , twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires . \\nThis style reflects Orwell 's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at \\tthe time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin 's Soviet Russia . \\nBackground \\t. \\nOrigin and \\twriting . \\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944 after his experiences during the \\tSpanish Civil War , which he described in `` Homage to Catalonia '' ( 1938 ) . \\nIn the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of `` Animal Farm '' , he explained how escaping the communist purges \\tin Spain taught him `` how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries '' . \\nThis motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he \\tsaw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals . \\n`` Homage to Catalonia '' sold poorly ; after seeing Arthur Koestler 's best-selling , `` Darkness at Noon \\t'' , about the Moscow Trials , Orwell decided that fiction would be the best way to describe totalitarianism . \\nImmediately prior to writing the book \\t, Orwell had quit the BBC . \\nHe was also upset about a booklet for \\tpropagandists the Ministry of Information had put out . \\nThe booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union , \\tsuch as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination . \\nIn the preface , Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm : \\tIn 1944 , the manuscript was almost lost when a German V-1 flying bomb destroyed his London home . \\nOrwell spent hours sifting through the \\trubble to find the pages intact . \\nPublication \\t. \\nPublishing \\t. \\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book \\tmight upset the alliance between Britain , the United States , and the Soviet Union . \\nFour publishers refused to publish `` Animal Farm '' , yet one had initially \\taccepted the work , but declined it after consulting the Ministry of Information . \\nEventually , Secker and Warburg published \\tthe first edition in 1945 . \\nDuring the Second World War , it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was \\tnot something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher Gollancz . \\nHe also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber , where the poet T. S. Eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book 's \\t`` good writing '' and `` fundamental integrity '' , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint `` which I take to be generally Trotskyite '' . \\nEliot said he found the view `` not convincing '' , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to \\trun the farm ; he posited that someone might argue `` what was needed ... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs '' . \\nOrwell let André Deutsch , who was working for Nicholson & amp ; Watson in 1944 , read the typescript , and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & amp ; \\tWatson would want to publish it ; however , they did not , and `` lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in `` Animal Farm '' '' . \\nIn his `` London Letter '' on 17 April 1944 for `` Partisan Review '' , Orwell \\twrote that it was `` now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed . \\nAnti-Russian books do appear , but mostly from Catholic publishing firms \\tand always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle '' . \\nThe publisher Jonathan Cape , who had initially accepted `` Animal Farm '' , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry \\tof Information warned him off – although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy . \\nWriting to Leonard Moore , a partner in the literary agency of Christy & amp ; Moore , publisher Jonathan \\tCape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information . \\nSuch flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable , and the choice of \\tpigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive . \\nIt may reasonably be assumed that the `` important official '' was a \\tman named Peter Smollett , who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent . \\nOrwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka , and he would be one of the names Orwell included \\tin his list of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949 . \\nThe publisher wrote to Orwell , saying : Frederic Warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela \\t, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the Red Army , which had played a major part in defeating Adolf Hitler . \\nA Russian translation was printed in the paper `` Posev '' , and in giving permission \\tfor a Russian translation of `` Animal Farm '' , Orwell refused in advance all royalties . \\nA translation in Ukrainian , which was produced in Germany , was confiscated in large \\tpart by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission . \\nIn October 1945 , Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the \\tpossibility that the political cartoonist David Low might illustrate `` Animal Farm '' . \\nLow had written a letter saying that he had had `` a good time with `` \\tAnimal Farm '' – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly '' . \\nNothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by Secker \\t& amp ; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned . \\nThe Folio Society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by Quentin Blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published \\tby Secker & amp ; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of `` Animal Farm '' . \\nPreface \\t. \\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR , their World War II ally : Although \\tthe first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it . \\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of `` \\tAnimal Farm '' in 1945 , without an introduction . \\nHowever , the publisher had provided space for a preface \\tin the author 's proof composited from the manuscript . \\nFor reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the \\tpage numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute . \\nIn 1972 , Ian Angus found the original typescript titled `` The Freedom of the Press '' , and Bernard Crick published it , together with \\this own introduction , in `` The Times Literary Supplement '' on 15 September 1972 as `` How the essay came to be written '' . \\nOrwell 's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press , specifically \\tthe suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government . \\nThe same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of `` Animal Farm '' \\twith another introduction by Crick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface . \\nOther publishers were still \\tdeclining to publish it . \\nReception \\t. \\nContemporary reviews of the work \\twere not universally positive . \\nWriting in the American `` New Republic '' magazine , George Soule expressed his \\tdisappointment in the book , writing that it `` puzzled and saddened me . \\nIt seemed on \\tthe whole dull . \\nThe allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in \\ta clumsy way things that have been said better directly '' . \\nSoule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations , and said , `` It seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous \\tsuccess ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well '' . \\n`` The Guardian '' on 24 August 1945 called `` Animal Farm '' `` a \\tdelightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few '' . \\nTosco Fyvel , writing in `` Tribune '' on the same day , called the book `` a gentle \\tsatire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us '' . \\nJulian Symons responded , on 7 September , `` Should we not expect , in `` Tribune '' at least , \\tacknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State – Soviet Russia ? \\nIt seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin , and Snowball \\twith Trotsky , and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author , upon a political ground . \\nIn a hundred years time perhaps , `` Animal Farm '' may be simply a fairy \\tstory ; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point '' . \\n`` Animal Farm '' has been subject to much \\tcomment in the decades since these early remarks . \\nBetween 1952 and 1957 , the CIA , in an operation codenamed Aedinosaur , sent millions of balloons carrying copies \\tof the novel into Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down . \\n`` Time '' magazine chose `` Animal Farm '' as one of the 100 best English-language novels ( 1923 \\tto 2005 ) ; it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels . \\nIt won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is \\tincluded in the Great Books of the Western World selection . \\nPopular reading in schools , `` Animal Farm '' was ranked \\tthe UK 's favourite book from school in a 2016 poll . \\n`` Animal Farm '' has also faced an array \\tof challenges in school settings around the US . \\nThe following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell 's work : \\t'' Animal Farm '' has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries . \\nThe ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow , Russia , in 1977 and \\tbanned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs , such as pigs or alcohol . \\nIn the same manner , `` Animal Farm '' \\thas also faced relatively recent issues in China . \\nIn 2018 , the government made the decision to censor all \\tonline posts about or referring to `` Animal Farm '' . \\nHowever the book itself , as of \\t2019 , remains sold in stores . \\nAmy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom of `` The Atlantic '' stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in Mainland China for several reasons : censors believe the general public is unlikely to read \\ta highbrow book , because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway , and because the Communist Party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability . \\nThe authors stated `` It was – and remains – as easy to buy `` 1984 '' and \\t`` Animal Farm '' in Shenzhen or Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles '' . \\nAn enhanced version of the book , launched in India in 2017 , was widely praised for capturing the author 's \\tintent , by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition . \\nAnalysis \\t. \\nAnimalism \\t. \\nThe pigs Snowball , Napoleon , and Squealer adapt Old Major 's ideas into `` a complete system of thought '' \\t, which they formally name Animalism , an allegoric reference to Communism , not to be confused with the philosophy Animalism . \\nSoon after , Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol \\t, sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments . \\nSquealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation , an allusion to the Soviet government \\t's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people 's beliefs about themselves and their society . \\nThe original commandments are : These commandments are also distilled into \\tthe maxim `` Four legs good , two legs bad ! '' \\nwhich is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often \\tto disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism . \\nLater , Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some \\tcommandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking . \\nThe changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded : Eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , `` All animals are equal , \\tbut some animals are more equal than others '' , and `` Four legs good , two legs better '' as the pigs become more anthropomorphic . \\nThis is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments , which were supposed to keep order within \\tAnimal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans ' evil habits . \\nThrough the revision of the commandments , Orwell demonstrates how \\tsimply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda . \\nSignificance and \\tallegory . \\nOrwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written , `` virtually \\tevery detail has political significance in this allegory '' . \\nOrwell himself wrote in 1946 , `` Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution ... [ and ] `` that kind '' of revolution ( violent \\tconspiratorial revolution , led by unconsciously power-hungry people ) can only lead to a change of masters [ – ] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert '' . \\nIn a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition , he stated , `` for the past ten years I have \\tbeen convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement . \\nOn my return from Spain [ in 1937 ] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story \\tthat could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages '' . \\nThe revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is \\tOrwell 's analogy with the October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution . \\nThe `` Battle of the Cowshed '' has been said to represent the allied invasion of Soviet \\tRussia in 1918 , and the defeat of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War . \\nThe pigs ' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR \\t, just as Napoleon 's emergence as the farm 's sole leader reflects Stalin 's emergence . \\nThe pigs ' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use , `` the turning point of the story '' as Orwell termed it in a letter to Dwight Macdonald , stands \\tas an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 Kronstadt revolt against the Bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various Five Year Plans . \\nThe puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure , and the pigs \\t' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s . \\nIn chapter seven , when the animals confess their non-existent crimes and are killed , \\tOrwell directly alludes to the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s . \\nThese contributed to Orwell 's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution \\thad been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten . \\nPeter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Davison contend that the `` Battle of the Windmill '' , \\tspecifically referencing the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow , represents World War II . \\nDuring the battle , Orwell first wrote , `` \\tAll the animals , including Napoleon '' took cover . \\nOrwell had the publisher alter this to `` All the animals except Napoleon '' \\tin recognition of Stalin 's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance . \\nOrwell requested the change after he met \\tJózef Czapski in Paris in March 1945 . \\nCzapski , a survivor of the Katyn Massacre and an opponent of the Soviet regime , told Orwell , as Orwell wrote to Arthur \\tKoestler , that it had been `` the character [ and ] greatness of Stalin '' that saved Russia from the German invasion . \\nOther connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell 's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness \\tthat ran through the countryside after the Rebellion , which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and in Germany ( Ch . \\nIV ) ; the conflict between \\tNapoleon and Snowball ( Ch . \\nV ) , parallelling `` the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another : Trotskyism , with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the \\tproletariat of the West ; and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia 's socialist destiny '' ; Napoleon 's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets ( Ch . \\nVI ) , paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo ; and Frederick 's forged bank notes , parallelling the \\tHitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 , after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill . \\nThe book 's close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement , reflected Orwell 's view of the 1943 Tehran Conference that seemed to display the \\testablishment of `` the best possible relations between the USSR and the West '' – but in reality were destined , as Orwell presciently predicted , to continue to unravel . \\nThe disagreement between the allies and the start of the Cold War is suggested when Napoleon \\tand Pilkington , both suspicious , each `` played an ace of spades simultaneously '' . \\nSimilarly , the music in the novel , starting with `` Beasts of England '' and the later anthems , parallels `` The \\tInternationale '' and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s . \\nAdaptations \\t. \\nStage \\tproductions . \\nIn 2021 , during pandemic restrictions , the National Youth Theatre toured a stage version of \\t`` Animal Farm ; '' this run included outdoor performances on a farm at Soulton Hall . \\nA solo version , adapted and performed by Guy Masterson , premiered at \\tthe Traverse Theatre Edinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since . \\nA theatrical version , with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell , was \\tstaged at the National Theatre London on 25 April 1984 , directed by Peter Hall . \\nIt toured nine \\tcities in 1985 . \\nA new adaptation written and directed by Robert Icke , designed by Bunny Christie with puppetry designed and \\tdirected by Toby Olié opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 2022 before touring the UK . \\nFilms \\t. \\n`` Animal Farm '' has \\tbeen adapted to film twice . \\nBoth differ from the novel and have been accused \\tof taking significant liberties , including sanitising some aspects . \\nAndy Serkis is directing an upcoming animated \\tfilm adaptation with Matt Reeves producing . \\nRadio \\tdramatisations . \\nA BBC radio version , produced by Rayner \\tHeppenstall , was broadcast in January 1947 . \\nOrwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square \\t, London , with Hugh Gordon Porteous , amongst others . \\nOrwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous , `` who had not read \\tthe book , grasped what was happening after a few minutes '' . \\nA further radio production , again using Orwell 's own dramatisation of \\tthe book , was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC Radio 4 . \\nTamsin Greig narrated , and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon , \\tToby Jones as the propagandist Squealer , and Ralph Ineson as Boxer . \\nComic \\tstrip . \\nIn 1950 , Norman Pett and his writing partner Don Freeman were secretly hired by the Information Research Department ( IRD \\t) , a secret wing of the British Foreign Office , to adapt `` Animal Farm '' into a comic strip . \\nThis comic was not published in the UK \\tbut ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers . \\n\""
